four members of Cape Verde were detained in Estonia and Spain
according to Mr Posselt , the police in Spain detained the leader of the so @-@ called KCape rovo Group in Spain , Sprvo Gulevich , who is known as SpinKCape rovski in the criminal world .
Gulevich arrested in Spain was arrested in the Court of Justice .
yesterday , the Court also took three suspects detained in Estonia .
according to suspicion , the so @-@ called &apos; Cape rovo &apos; criminal Community members aged between 27 and 57 years of life , who are mainly committed to drug crimes .
in the province of Mala in Spain , the alleged leader of the criminal community was detained .
in Estonia , three men were detained as a suspect , one of which has been collected according to the criminal community figures , and two are members of the criminal community .
the data collected indicate that tasks and roles were clearly divided in the criminal community .
the purpose of the actual Community action was to commit drug crimes and thus serve the proceeds of criminal activity , &quot; commented on the head of the pre @-@ trial procedure , Public Prosecutor Vagio Verte .
&quot; we do not rule out that the circle of suspected criminals is increasing , &quot; added the Prosecutor .
it is people who have also been involved in the law enforcement authorities in the past , and some of them have been punished for drug crimes .
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been high throughout the investigation .
&quot; international cooperation has become commonplace for us , and this week &apos;s operation shows the success of cooperation , &quot; commented on the Prosecutor Verte .
the head of the central criminal police service , ago in Leis , said that the detention was preceded by nearly half a year of pre @-@ trial .
&quot; in the first half of the week , a long @-@ term work was realised and , at the same time , in Estonia and Spain , we have been suspected of committing crimes . &quot;
Leis added that central criminal police officers were instrumental in detention in Spain .
for years now , we have a good contact and mutual understanding with the Spanish police and civil card .
these detentions are yet another message to criminals that we can also get them from another European search , &quot; said Leis .
the information gathered so far clearly indicates that , in the absence of a suspect , men can continue to commit new crimes , which is why the Prosecutor &apos;s office has requested their arrest and the Court also approved it .
a man arrested in Spain is waiting for his surrender to Estonia .
in this criminal case , property , vehicles and cash have been seized in order to ensure confiscation .
the pre @-@ trial procedure of the Criminal Court will be carried out by the central criminal police Office and led by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office .
the city of Tallinn was convicted of blackmail in 2005 by the Mayor of Gulevich and punished him with a five @-@ year imprisonment .
in the middle of the last decade , Gulevitši was held as the second most important man in the criminal world of Estonia , following a broad Tarankov , Mr Nikolai Tarankov .
Gulevich from Cape rovos rose in the beginning of the 1990s in Estonia when he started to deal with blackmail in Tallinn .
Admittedly , he taxed taxi drivers and prostitution and ordered a monthly tax on businessmen .
international joint operations , confiscation of criminal proceeds and the entry into force of judicial decisions confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective .
for example , the latest court rulings , the so @-@ called &apos; Dikayev &apos; criminal offence of eight accused persons who have been confiscated by EUR 80 000 in criminal proceeds , or the judgment against nine persons in 2006 , that Igor Aleynikov created a criminal community aimed at illegal trade in cigarettes and trafficking in human beings in Eastern Viruland and in southern Estonia .
there is a total of EUR 71 500 in confiscated criminal profits .
in these criminal matters , it has ensured that police officers exchange information and prosecutors every day with foreign colleagues and , if necessary , carry out operations in any country of the European Union .
civil rights group warns of Mistral travel
the National Association for the Advaner of Colored People ( NAPs ) has warned the people of the Muslim State of Colored People for discriminatory policies and racist attacks .
in the statement of the Group , the &apos; Missouri State &apos; NAP , which applies until 28 August 2017 , calls on all American passengers , visitors and sourians to be particularly attentive and extremely cautious when moving around the whole state , given the suspicious racial events that have taken place recently in the state and at this point . &quot;
according to NAPs , the group urged the group to issue a travel warning , both the recent Missouri law , which makes it more difficult to win cases of discrimination , and the fact that the state of law targets for the purpose of the state of the State &apos;s law is largely minority .
&quot; citizens &apos; rights are being violated .
they are being drawn up because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &apos; said Rod Chapel , President of the NAP , Rod Chapel , The Kansas City Star .
&quot; we have never received so much complaints before . &quot;
this is the first such warning that the organisation has issued on the state of the US .
the group referred to events such as racist insults against black students at Missouri University and the death of 28 @-@ year @-@ old musicians from Tennesta .
the Sanders died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of this year , after he had run out of petrol in the state and the Missouri police took him in custody without being accused of a crime .
in addition , the comment refers to the recent report by the Chief Prosecutor of Missouri , which shows that in the state , the cars of black car drivers are halted by 75 % more likely than those of white drivers .
&apos;The comment is intended for people to be aware and to warn their families , friends and collaborators for what might happen in Missouris , &apos; said Chapel .
&quot; people need to be ready , whether it is to be involved in the bail @-@ out or to inform relatives that they are going through the state . &quot;
on the basis of the latest data from the FBI hate crime programme , 100 hate crime crimes were documented in Missouris in 2015 , which places the state in the state of similar violations in the country &apos;s cross @-@ section 16 .
the travel warning is also a response to the new law of Missouri , which makes it difficult for a company to be brought to court for reasons of discrimination in search of housing or work .
the American Civil Liberties Association ( ACLU ) had previously issued travel barriers to Texas and Arizona , following the adoption by these states of immigration laws , which obliged local authorities to arrest people for violations of immigration , because , according to the ACLU , it increases racial profiling .
usually , travel warnings are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on other countries , but in recent times , interest groups have started to use this measure as a response to certain US laws and trends .
Hepatitis : what could everyone know about the different forms of this difficult disease ?
Hepatitis , or incineration , may be caused by five different - A , B , C , D and E hepatitis .
all these viruses are provoking a fierce burn .
however , the worst cost is chronic B and C hepatitis , which can develop into a circus , or a lip , to pay for cancer .
the epidemiology Adviser of the Health Agency , Mr Kurel , is saying that acute hepatitis disease is the same for all types of liver incineration - a fever , fatigue , stunning , birth , oliberalisation , cruelty , grey emissions , horse mackerel , meat and excess pain , and swine and limasters .
the last hour of disease also comes from the popular name of the liver burn .
children can undergo hepatitis without disease .
the various species of combustion can only be identified on the basis of a laboratory study .
extreme hepatitis can go to chronic hepatitis and go for decades without disease , which means that a person may not know anything about his or her dangerous disease .
Mr Kutsar highlights different forms of hepatitis and describes their culmination more closely .
the hepatitis virus is spreading from a disease to humans and infectious us in eating contaminated food or drinking water , on the road to seals , on the hands of infected people and on food , soil , objects , sugar , and drug consumption .
a hepatitis was infected by family members and carers , people suffering from chronic pay , sex people , sex men with men , drug users , the high spread of hepatitis A .
vaccination can be prevented by vaccinations , in particular by recommending vaccination for people who travel a lot of travel and hepatitis A .
in addition , it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements : to wash or disinfect hands , before the consumption of all fruit and vegetables is washed .
the hepatitis virus is spreading in the face of the blood of a sick person , in the face of drugs , in the incineration of drugs , in augmentation , in the use of blood @-@ contaminated sites ( toothmeters , pregnant women ) , in the use of donor blood , hepatitis hepatitis , in the sex of hepatitis , and in hepatitis hospital .
the hepatitis hepatitis group includes drugs , the sex partners of the infected person , sex men , men who are infected with the mother &apos;s newborn , sick family members and carers , blood and other body liquids , health , rescue workers and police officers , and passengers who visit the countries with hepatitis B .
in order to prevent hepatitis , it is possible to vaccinate people ; in particular , it is recommended to vaccinate people who are at risk and , in addition to chronic pay @-@ related diseases , HIV infections , sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes .
hepatitis other preventive measures are : refrain from the hygiene and manure of strangers , other sharp tools and systalde @-@ counters , other sharp resources , and the use of needle @-@ advice , and the use of condoms in the event of a dangerous mixture of infection , or the prevention of sexual risk .
vaccination against hepatitis is part of the national immunisation scheme in Estonia and free of charge for children .
Hepatitis C virus is spreading in the face of the blood of a sick person , drug injection , therapeutic , augmentation , the use of blood @-@ contaminated fodder , donor blood , hepatitis hepatitis , sex and hepatitis hospital for animals / newborn babies .
C @-@ hepatitis @-@ hepatitis @-@ hepatitis infections include drug users , sex partners of infected people , sex men , infant infant mothers , sick family members and carers , blood and other body fluids , health , rescue workers and police officers , HIV @-@ infected persons and C hepatitis high @-@ disease travellers .
C hepatitis preventive action is : refrain from the hygiene and manure of strangers , other sharp tools and systalde @-@ councillotteries , other cereals and augmentation , and use of condoms in the event of a dangerous mixture of infection .
there is no vaccine against hepatitis C .
Ahepatitis is caused by hepatitis D virus , which is multiplying in the presence of hepatitis B .
as a result , hepatitis D infections , together with hepatitis B or superinformation , occur in chronic B hepatitis .
the hepatitis virus is spreading exposure to blood and other body liquids , contaminated with needles , sexually and seldom infected animals .
d &apos;hepatitis &apos;s risk group &apos; is chronic B @-@ hepatitis virers and people who do not have immunity from hepatitis B .
an effective preventive measure is vaccination against hepatitis B , which also protects people from hepatitis virus infection .
hepatitis @-@ hepatitis viruses of drinking water and food , including low heat @-@ treated beef , fish and marine carbons , donor blood , joint systalls and infected animals .
passengers can be infected with the high incidence of hepatitis E in countries .
the prevention of hepatitis preventive measures is compliance with hygiene requirements : to wash or disinfect hands after the fire , before food production and feed , after hospital care .
fruit and vegetables are washing before consumption , to avoid eating little heat @-@ treated beef , fish and seafood , only safe drinking water and to avoid drug consumption .
although the last round of competitors tried to get rid of the four @-@ fold Olympic winners , 34 @-@ year @-@ old Farah final sgel found strength and won 26.49.51 .
the Farah did not think long enough , after the finalists , with the husband Tania and children .
this was a special moment for me .
I very much regret my family .
it was wonderful to be with them , &quot; said Farah journalists .
Farah is targeted in London at the fifth edition of 5 000 and 10 000 metres of the golden heading .
everything is possible if there are religions .
despite the title , Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;Connorm , &apos; Daam gold &apos; , Gustav Klimti , Adele Bloch @-@ Baueri , has an extraordinary story of &apos; one of the art works &apos; , much deeper than the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century in Vienna .
but even more in the history .
the inflammatory information on the basis of the prize , which is to say , a snapshot , a narrower topic would have been allowed to have more influence on the extraordinary nature of the title of the title .
at the moment , it would be like two books : Gustav Klimti and his painting &apos; Daam gold &apos; , the story of Adel Bloch @-@ Baueri , and a much more extensive and comprehensive time @-@ to @-@ day history and the German occupation , along with its subsequent effects in Austria .
the first third of the book will lead in the middle of the wedding Vienna cultural life and who , in the Austrian capital itself , can hardly imagine how more than a hundred years ago , life in Ringstrass , or how the Centrali coffee , when the climate was introduced .
the concentration of cultural figures was high in one of the richest cities in Europe , and when we saw the name in the book , some of them are known as a gram of culture .
at the same time , for example , the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a city where untreated arson and was the highest level of suicide in Europe , the development of a story as if nothing is done .
or perhaps , however , every couple of couples , too , will add colour to the cultural life of the 20th century in Vienna .
dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
in recent decades of the 19th century , the number of Jews in Vienna has grown exponentially , becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe .
the Sajandical exchange was almost one in ten people in Vienna .
parents were also newcomers in Vienna , but by the time when the aid for Adele was two times opened up to the Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Blochevery and the Klimtile , his father had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire Empire .
however , Adelet &apos;s entire life , which he belonged to , did not draw up .
if you look at the &apos; Daami gold &apos; , it is difficult to believe that the end of life was infected by this kind of socialism and dreams of a trip to the Soviet Union .
in 1903 , when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his husband &apos;s luggage from the Klimtig , the last moment was the painting maker in Vienna .
the climt ordered 4 000 kroons at the time , a quarter of the price of a good location for the rural house .
the fact that there was a suspicion of the modelli of the masters of a few sports martyrs , the sugar magnati , was not discouraged .
as far as the deletion is concerned , the only certainty is that the relationship between the modelli and the artist created during the work continued to the end of life .
Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;Connor - &apos; Daam gold &apos; .
the Gustav Klimti Cup , Adele Bloch @-@ Baueri &apos;s extraordinary story , &quot; Varrak 2016 , Aldo Randland .
just before the start of the work with the Adelega , Mr Ravennas San Vitale had visited the climate , and the investigators think that it was precisely there that the wonderful mosaic countries of Theodora , which were seen as a &apos; golden &apos; banner , gave an artificial idea to make a golden tree .
the climt presented his &apos; Daam gold &apos; in Vienna in 1908 and at the same time ( 1907 @-@ 1908 ) , one of the golden land &apos; Snovel &apos; was born .
artistic historians did not notice the similarity of two women .
how does Hitler relate to nature ?
&quot; I think that my friend , Mr Klimti , will be indebted to him to make his work available to the public , &quot; wrote to Adel Bloch @-@ Bauer a few years after the departure of the artist ( Klimt died in February 1918 ) to the Director of the Belvedere museum , and wanted their family to go to the museum .
six years prior to death , the Kliml had been killed by the Adelee .
he also asked for the husband to leave her two sports courses and four Gustav Klimti landscapes to the Austrian Galeri in February 1925 .
in his truths , he has written to Mrs Mariana and Mr Lui .
one year after the Klimt had finished the &apos; Austrian Mona lisa &apos; , it had attempted to access the Acadeissuer Academine of Viini , 17 years of Adolf Hitler , but failed in the drawing up of the German .
although sometimes Hitler &apos;s later anti @-@ Semitism is considered to be the reason for the Jewish professors not to be admitted to the anti @-@ Semitism , none of his exhortations were actually Jewish .
in any case , the Austrian Galspecial task was referred to in 1939 , which has changed considerably in 1939 , and it was important to find the work of the Vienna rich Jewish art collections .
Hitler &apos;s personal art musicians also had some work at home , but not those of the climate .
Sixty years after the Nazi arts , a 10 @-@ year @-@ old court dispute between the Austrian Government and Bloch @-@ Baucher was launched .
at this point , it should be noted that , if &apos; Snovel &apos; is seen in Vienna in Belvedere Castle , Adele Bloch @-@ Bauer &apos;s &apos; Daami gold &apos; must be seen to travel to New York Neue Galspecial .
and before Vienna , the aforementioned book will also be read .
even if you do not intend to look at the work of the climate , because at least my emotion , after the closure of the book , was more laughing and the Jewish issue than the magic and modell Adele Bloch @-@ Bauer resold for USD 135 million .
so it is not so much of a tree , rather than a marriage - and a very moving story .
it has significantly facilitated the orientation of the events at the beginning of the book on the sex of Bauer .
17 @-@ year @-@ old flooding in Canada was very close to Estonia
in the event of life , gold was very close to the personal record of its own 200 m of selicking in 2.16.62 .
the Tippmark comes from 17 @-@ year @-@ old pirates every week since the Canadian cheese Championships were awarded 2.16.58 , the Priit Aavik Ujugation blog .
gold is the last one , or the tenth A @-@ finalist .
in Finally , he went through a distance of 2.15.76 and achieved a good seventh place with a new powerful top @-@ level .
Alina Kendziorn , Estonia &apos;s record ( 2.15.13 ) remained a little over half a second .
Estonia &apos;s all @-@ time ranking rose by the third , and its fresh personal top mark is the fifth result of all the times in Estonia .
the young hope for the future is Canada &apos;s adult Championships of 100 mm , 200 m and 400 m in balballs and 200 mm and 400 mm .
last week in Toronto , Canada took place in the Championship of Canada , and gold has done a successful start there .
he won 200 m in a silver bullet with 2.03.22 .
so quickly , this distance was swamped by the last year in 2008 .
the Golf faster than ever , Estonia has only distanced itself from the record of Estonia &apos;s record , Elina Parevika .
as a guardian of Canada , there has been an excellent personal record of 100 m vouchers in Canada , and 56.66 of the new Estonian season .
for example , the old Kertu ly Alnek of his year has distanced it from one century more quickly .
in his personal excellence , he reached a further 100 m in the opening of a letter of 1.03.69 in the opening of a briefing .
for half a longer distance , he has only reached the seventh place when the finalist was 17.31 .
gold is currently leading to four different distances from the Estonian season .
President Trump goes on holiday , critics insured teeth
the holiday time is in the hands of the US President , Donald Trumple , too .
however , as the Trump has been one of the most most of the holiday days , the critics have already been toothpaste .
according to the US Guard and CNN , the President intends to have 17 @-@ day leave in the Bedminster , which is located in New Jerseys .
although the President &apos;s leave began yesterday , the anti @-@ Trumpi leave has already been spoken for weeks .
they are asking the Olympic Games for too frequent treatment .
it is the President &apos;s practice to spend a week in his Florida , Virginia and New Jersey &apos;s cotton .
by the way , Trump is not the most puzzled President in his 196 term .
for example , George W. Bush has already reached 67 days on holiday , Barack Obama , but 21 days less than Trump , but 21 days .
however , things tend to be forgotten quickly by the Olympic Games .
the days after becoming President , Mr Trump said , &apos; 60 minutes &apos; , that there will be no time for long holidays , because there is a great deal to be done .
he also expressed three years ago his outrage at Barack Obama &apos;s leave .
the current President wrote on Twitter : &apos; while Obama is on holiday , plays a golf , it is on the brakes and the jungle concerts , journalists in the face of the sun &apos; .
according to the white house officials , 17 @-@ day golf club visits to pollen have no place .
it is officially called &apos; working holiday &apos; , during which there is no time for the Trul to read or for other forms of action .
in addition , there was also a second reason for working holiday .
in particular , the White House will be replaced by a Western @-@ style pension system , and therefore all staff had to leave it .
the West is also located in Ovalkacabinet and other presidential premises .
&quot; I do not believe that any of you would like to be in the West in August if there is 38 degrees and there is no contention , &quot; said Lindsay Walters , who stressed that the President will continue to work during the holiday period .
where President Trump will follow 17 days , you will get an idea of video .
blocking of critics from Facebook to do not stand for the state of office if you do not tolerate the criticism of the voters .
the father of our country knew a great deal about the unfavourable media coverage .
the Americans loved George Washington , but the newspapers did not take a long time to get him to grips with everything from internal politics to his political principles .
of course , it was annoyed by the criticism .
but he did not forced his critics to remain silent .
because , in the year 1783 , Washington said that &apos; freedom of expression may be taken away from us and , in darkness and silence , we could be chaired by sheep . &apos;
this brings me to Mr Hogan , Larry Hogan , who has worked hard to be more in Washington .
it has been blocked and deleted by at least 450 people who expressed their views on his official Facebook page .
and at the beginning of the week , the Union for Freedom of American Civil Liberties ( ACLU ) has therefore been brought to court .
the Governor of the Governor of the Governor of the Civil Guard was a trivial action and web commentaries slide away from reactions in a style of &apos; who is interested ? &apos; .
&quot; this is just Facebook , &quot; said many .
but that is what counts .
and this is particularly important when it comes to a man like Hogan .
this is an amazing popular republicist in the democratic state .
his approval rate is the second highest in the country &apos;s 50 @-@ month Governor .
Hogan is not an unthinkable response .
he has led the state firmly and has remained strictly firm in its principles .
in addition , it has used the main tool in communicating with its voters on Facebook , for example , after the first time after the chemical waste , for the first time in a stubborn presentation .
it is therefore a public forum with a formal label , which is managed by the staff of taxpayers &apos; dollars to block the people who are visiting the country of taxpayers &apos; money , which is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with Mr Chastel , the representative of the Hogan press , defended the behaviour of the Governor of the Governor , claiming that the blocking of comments was nothing other than a modelling .
however , it is too easy to taste the picture of Internet checks on the web , spawers or people full of hatred .
the post spoke to a number of people who were blocked by Hogan .
and that is precisely what they are people who are in contact with their elected leaders , the owner of the company and the passport , not Internet controls .
they all said that their comments were disrespectful , thought @-@ out and not the rogue .
Mr Pastor quoted the Bible in his post , by emphasising the Hogan Catholic traffic .
a lawyer from Marylant Bowie , Lakshm Sarma Raman , did not instigate hatred , but rather hate crime .
&quot; I said politely that I am disappointed , because he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news , &apos; he wrote The mail news story in the country .
&quot; I also do not like the idea that , when many people comment on the same subject , some of them immediately call a collective effort , instead of recognising that this is a great deal of concern with citizens . &quot;
what the Governor &apos;s officials called &apos; targeted spam attack &apos; would probably invite others to &apos; public support &apos; .
the Facebook era allows messages to be easily matching , simply blocking criticism or deleting a negative comment .
it is a lot of cleaner than the old , when the workers had to be sent out to do the same , so that they gather newspapers with critical editorial letters and burn them or arrest protestors and forced them to remain silent .
but that is exactly what is happening now , just digitally .
the Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised on Facebook and other social media .
President Trumpi has complained to court Twitter users who have been blocked by Twitter .
one of the first signs of court rulings on this subject was made last week in Virginia .
Mr James C. Cacheris decided in Alexandria that Mr Loudouni County of the Board of supervisors of the County Council breached the first amendment of the Constitution when he blocked the election on his Facebook page .
Mr Kentuckys visited the ACLU Facebook and Twitter for the use of him by Governor Matt Bevinit ( R ) .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , affordable postal costs had a similar impact on the Internet .
between 1776 and 1800 , the number of newspapers and anonymous writers dared his way of leadership .
and even then Washington had to deal with anonymous controls .
people wrote letters from the newspapers such as Juricola , Valerius , Belisarius and Portius , making Washington &apos;s decisions .
according to the historical documents collected by George Washington , the web @-@ based George Washington project , he swamped the cabinet of petitions which criticised his views on the Great Britain &apos;s friendship , trade and shipping agreements .
but he did not have forced them to remain silent .
freedom of expression , special opinions and debates are the foundations of our country .
and the right leadership means accepting this .
Ronan Rafferty hopes for the comfort of Renaissance in Cenaissance
the former European Chairwoman Ronan Rafferty hopes for the comfort of the home territory in the next three days , when the East Lobor Renaissance Club golf courses will take place 25 .
the Irish , who was in the vicinity of Archerfield Linony in the last year , ahead of the last round of Mr Paul Ealhighlighted , is in a new place , and is playing a role of the club and the executive leader , Jerry Soledi , instead of the seat of the club .
&quot; I saw Renaissance Club built , and now we see how the club will be fully sparked by this event , &quot; said Rafferty .
&quot; the players see the path in their best form , it is in a brilliant state .
Jerry has done an excellent job in building this place .
he is a keen supporter of golf games and is proud of what has been achieved here .
this will allow the path to be presented perfectly . &quot;
the English ever looks forward to the first time being able to protect the championship , although the man has won both the European Toubon and the European challenge in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; this is a very special feeling , &quot; said Sethportis &apos;s beating player .
&quot; I could not defend the title of my Extremadura OAntwerp , because it was a year after my victory in the contest .
it is a scandal to come back to it .
this is an excellent place to play a golf .
I remember the memories of last year , for me and for my wife , Mrs Sharon , was a special victory for last year .
it was a very special time that we will be at the heart of the day . &quot;
on the soil of the country , Gary Orr , who joined the European Year of Creativity , will also return to the competition once he received 50 .
this is his first event in Scotland after the participation of Aberdeen asset Management Scottish Openil in 2013 .
&quot; at home , it is always a little more meaningful , &quot; said Helensburgh man Orr .
&apos;Tahad to be well done , but at the same time , you also have an additional feeling .
I have enjoyed playing again enormously and quite a decent golf game .
I am pleased with the progress made so far . &quot;
Trioga will join the former MasterCard &apos;s winner , ian Woosnam , and Paul Broadhurst , Roger Chapman , mark James and mark McNulty .
Orr and former Ryder carika Captain Sam Turin are two in six competitions , the rest of which are Andrew Oldcorn , Stephen McAllister , Bill Longmuir and ross Drumond .
access is free of charge , and car parking costs GBP 5 to a car with one passenger and GBP 10 to two or more passengers .
all revenues go to charity to Probuy Caner UK .
poverty and death in the gold @-@ rich country of Indonesia
if Mr Degei &apos;s dinner is produced , he will not use lead .
he seldom uses even boys .
Indonesia &apos;s capital in the capital of Papua province Paniai , in the capital of the Municipality of Paniai , places a house in the home language of a nota , in place of direct fire in the local language .
in a half hour &apos; time , the coal @-@ fired sludge will be taken from fire and skinned with unbeating hands .
the Degei is sitting on the other floor of the furniture of furniture , and yet it is also doing its daily homework , for example , washing the bath water from a nearby sex .
the role of the baby is being played by unscrupulous support .
since he is the four women of his husband , he has not been appointed to take care of any contempt .
Polygaamia is common here on May .
late work may be dangerous , however , for the majority of men in the village , and many of them drink hard , plus soldiers here .
&quot; no one dare to go around after five o &apos;clock in the village , &apos; he says .
this is a rare pilot in Papua mäki , which is a former Dutch colony , which was brought under the auspices of Indonesia in 1969 after a referendum , which was forced to vote in front of the forces .
the movement of the Netherlands , which has freed up the power of the people of the Netherlands , has quickly fuelled its rails against the government of Jakarta , which is still keeping the region under its strong control , preventing foreign journalists and human rights supervisors .
in 2003 , the province was officially split into the Pope and the West Pope , so that the independent Papua New Guinea was left in the east .
the majority of the wheel is both remote and abandoned , and in order to arrive here , 90 minutes from the capital of the province , Jayapuri , and then go through a five @-@ hour journey with a rental car .
there is no public transport .
the city of around 19 000 inhabitants is made up of tree houses surrounded by bambs and covers lainous iron roofs , which have been transformed into a different tone for the triumph of the barrel .
very few indicators have taken place here , not to mention journalists , and there have been almost no foreigners here .
prior to the arrival of Christian missionaries , Mee Pago paints a God called Tamee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear such ideas , &apos; says Degei , referring to our colourful approach to the market , to the plug and to the private sector .
&quot; prior to this , we have only had a plant cow . &quot;
Papua Indonesia is the poorest province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and infant mortality and illiteracy statistics are one of the worst in Asia .
however , it is also a gold @-@ rich country in Indonesia .
just 100 km away from Paniao , which is a mountainous province with 153 000 inhabitants of New Jersey , is the world &apos;s largest and most profitable gold mine , Grasberg , which belongs to the Phoenixis company Fbetg McMoran .
in 2015 alone , the Fbete report extracted approximately USD 3.1 billion worth of gold and copper .
in addition , it will be possible to contend with the supply of timber , which is estimated at USD 78 billion .
however , these riches are a source of suffering for boats , as they result in the presence of a powerful Indonesian army .
the New York Times 2005 study showed that the Freport report paid around USD 20 million to local military and military units between 1998 and 2004 , including USD 150 000 to one of the victims .
Pope &apos;s efforts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden and they are routinely betrayed .
according to human rights activists , more than 500 000 boats have been killed since 1969 and thousands more have been raped , tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army .
according to the Committee on Human Rights in Asia , the mass killing of the genocide in Papua tribal mountains in the 1970s was a measure of genocide .
last year alone , over 3900 peaceful protests were arrested by the police in Indonesia .
the 2016 report of the Birsbane Archbishop &apos; We lose all &apos; contains testimony to the atrocities committed in the previous year , such as non @-@ judicial executions , torture ( one second report , in particular , rape and electric shock ) and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; the number of victims is difficult to read , because such incidents will take place every week , &quot; says Andreas Harsono , a researcher of Human Rights Watch .
Krums are still more strongly closed because Papua natural resources have caused the influx of new settlements from elsewhere in Indonesia .
83 % of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians , but demographics are changing , because the Muslim economic migrants are coming from the inhabitants of Indonesia , Kalimantan , Sumatra and Sulawes islands .
CVs are sold in the gallery and mixed vegetables to gado @-@ gado @-@ gado , which will be stolen together with the ground level .
local cannot compete with them .
&quot; migrants started to sell chicken and vegetables from local boats on the traditional market , &quot; explains the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Italians born in Paniais , who worked on behalf of the province of Jayapuri .
&quot; Symama @-@ Mama &#91; women &#93; in Papua mama &#91; women &#93; lose their market share . &quot;
the President of Indonesia , Joko Widodo , who is known as Jokow , promised in his election campaign in 2014 to address these inequalities and human rights violations in Pope .
the former pump won the presidential Palace in Papua 29 constituencies 27 , including Paniai .
however , the Pope has changed very little , and the local feel cheated .
&quot; our hearts have been broken , because in 2014 , we voted in favour of Jokow in the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes in terms of restoring justice , &quot; says you .
in fact , only two months after Jokow took office in October , Paniai was in a low position .
on 7 December 2014 , 11 children in the majority of the Roma were singing to Christmas , when two Indonesian soldiers were blinded by the darkness of motorcycles .
children have told them that they should be included in the front lights .
according to the words of the local passport , Yavedt Tebai , one of the soldiers insulted their voting tone and later returned to four soldiers .
according to the victims and spectators , in drink @-@ driving soldiers , children were driven by children and beaten them with their guns .
one of the soldiers then shot among children .
one child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Yulianus Yeimot , was so cruel that he fell into the home .
a few hours later , the building of the close electoral Commission was burnt down , and the next day , things were even further .
around 1 000 young men , women and children gathered in a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .
they were carrying out direct repair , and they presented Papua mee pago to waita @-@ tantsu , during which drinking around and buried poultry songs .
some protesters started to lecture the police and the military .
&apos;If the crowds show more than three times resistance , let them go down , &apos; the official document , which has seen a magazine , but which has not been issued to local media publications , was sent to the soldiers .
Key Koto , the city of Kego Koto , the oldest city of Yeremias Kayme ( 56 ) felt threatened and called for peace to be maintained , asking for a crowd to go home .
no one was willing to listen .
&quot; turning me back to the left , I was suddenly shot in the left , &apos; he said to the magazine at the time of his German colours on the blood of the tree .
we still do not know who was shot , but says that the soldiers of the soldiers gathered in the month came from .
&quot; there was a lot of people , a lot of children in the House , adding it .
the local man , Alfius Youw , has been shot three times , according to his shooting .
&quot; I would like to go to him and in his body to make sure that it is with him , &apos; said the magazine at the time in Yohanes , who uses only one name in many indicators .
&quot; I saw that he has died ... Snovel leta . &quot;
the chief inspector of Papua police , Yotje Mende , said to reporters that he was only subject to the security of his department , as it was attacked .
&quot; we need to protect ourselves if we are threatened to kill , &quot; said Vice @-@ President Pudjo Sulistiyo , the spokesman of Papua police in 2015 .
&quot; this is a matter of life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young protestors were killed and many injured .
the news about the killings reached Jakartail only next day .
three weeks later , Jokow Jayapuras made a passionate speech in which he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and promised to deal with the mistreatment of the Pope .
&quot; I want to resolve this case immediately so that it will never happen again in the future , &quot; he said .
the Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would introduce an ADR mechanism to address human rights crimes .
but almost immediately , the excuses were also followed .
&quot; most crimes happened long ago .
some of them took place in the 1990s and the early 1990s .
the point is that we are committed to resolving these crimes , but we must follow certain processes , &apos; he said .
on 5 June in Jakartas , on 5 June , Wiranto withdrew his words , saying that he has no intention of creating a Pope mechanism to deal with complaints .
instead , he said that &apos; everything will be resolved according to the law &apos; .
the Wiranto , who has been accused by the United Nations of crimes against human rights in relation to the death of more than 1 000 people in East Timor during the bloody independence referendum in 1999 , said that 11 human rights crimes have already been resolved , including what happened in Paniais .
the families of the victims of the Paniai have adopted such claims with a gloomy mistrust .
&quot; I have been heard four times over the last three years , but there has been no progress , &quot; said Yohanes .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that there is still a fear for years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; I fear that the army will arrest me , I am afraid I am shot . &quot;
he brother Yacobus confirmed the opinion that the people of Paniai are afraid of this incident .
he said that he was beaten by the army after he had helped to bury four victims .
&quot; after the burying of the bodies , the army had to look at me , &apos; he says .
the celebrations have not stopped .
on Tuesday , the inhabitants of the village of Indonesia were shot in Deiyais in the village of Paniai .
one person was killed and 17 wounded , including children , when it went to war between the inhabitants of the village and the head of the construction company , who refused to transport an unconscious man to hospital .
this male people , 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ravianus Douw , who drowning fish in a nearby river , died on the road to hospital .
the recent village inhabitants protested at the construction site before the company &apos;s office .
according to the police , the people of the villages were storing the police , which was followed by the latest warning visits .
however , according to local authorities , mobile British people ( Indonesia &apos;s military police ) started to shoot at the people , killing one person .
&quot; we were in great panic , we are afraid of revenge , &quot; said 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dominggu Badii , who live near the hospital and saw the insect of those injured .
&quot; I have beaten myself two days in my own house . &quot;
the Deiyai Parliament has called for the prosecution of police officers involved and the withdrawal of the police in the area of mobile Brigade .
Paniai has always been a problem for the Government of Indonesia .
the lack of meaningful development will feed into the dissatisfaction of the honey , moni , dann and dammal tribes living in Papua bad .
many of them have joined the army of Liberation ( VPL ) insurgents , which , according to their own , protects the rights of boats , by organising attacks and abductions among the Indonesian soldiers .
some VPL leaders come from Paniao , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .
in response to this , the army , under the pretext of protecting the sovereignty of the country , has been arrested in Paniai over the last few years and has arbitrarily detained thousands of people .
some of them never appear again .
among the people of Papua people , Panians are known as &apos; tragic forgotten &apos; .
poverty feeds dissatisfaction .
the low rice that is sold in the majority is too expensive for local purchases .
the Leib is the same unavailable .
people are growing all their food themselves , mainly in the bata , in addition to a little fruit and vegetables .
farming is the work of women , each of whom can care for four or five bailines .
they usually keep most of the harvest to the family , the rest is sold on the local market .
ten batates cost only 10 000 Indonesian sites ( 75 cents ) .
over time , economic inequalities have deepened between inshore boats and new migrants , who have arrived at the Nabire airport from the opening of new air routes .
these few jobs , which exist , are going to be better educated and more prosperous migrants .
the Pope himself often lacks capital or the necessary skills to conduct a competitive business .
&quot; young people are not interested in leaving the village because there are no jobs and no money , &quot; says John Gobai , Chairman of the Council of Paniai .
segregation keeps the eyes of the world away from the Pope .
in addition , strict restrictions on foreign media remain .
at the beginning of this year , French journalists Franck Escudie and Babridge Longchamp were sent out , because &apos; they did not follow the relevant practices &apos; , although they were given a rare film authorisation .
according to the Vice @-@ President of Human Rights Watch , Pcomm Kine , the Vice @-@ President of the Asian department of Human Rights Watch , has failed to implement the restrictions on reports to promote transparency and development in Jokow .
&quot; in Indonesia , journalists from the most eastern provinces and the West Pope reports are threatening to face new threats to the rejection of a visa and a black list , &quot; he said in a statement .
the absence of the press means that international pressure on the government of Indonesia is largely limited to Papua near neighbours .
in March , six Pacific countries were encouraged by Tonga , Nauru , Belau , Tupain , Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands to examine the &apos; various wide @-@ ranging crimes &apos; in the UN Human Rights Council , including the shooting of Paniai .
the same countries have historically supported VPL .
Mr Arrmanatha Nasir , the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia , dismissed the accusations of a group , saying Jakartas journalists : &apos; Indonesia still applies democratic order and freedom of the press , so that evidence of cases against human rights is difficult to bury &apos; .
the local people want more foreign governments to notice .
when the Dutch official delegation visited Jayapura on 4 May Jayapura , the country &apos;s human rights Ambassador , was interrupted by local people at the meeting , but the source of anonymous desire to remain silent , urging : &apos; we want freedom &apos; .
in Indonesia , the new presidential elections will take place in 2019 , but the boats do not believe that they will vote in favour of Jokow again .
&apos;Jokow is a man with good intentions , but the people around him who are involved in the shooting of Paniai &apos; say Hobai , President of the Council .
he wants to give Jokow to understand that , in addition to the fact that the people of Paniai are constantly living under the threat of a predatory army , they are suffering from poor education and health services .
according to Gobai , the people of Paniai , as well as other boats , regard their voice to Jokow as a debt that has to be paid .
&quot; they do not need money , they want justice , &apos; he says .
despite the misfortune and intimidation , the families of the victims of the Paniai fire were still coping with the last symbolic reception of one victim to the police station and the army in the country in response to the death of one victim .
knowing that justice may never be put on its feet , they will not at least allow those responsible to forget their crimes .
&quot; one of our family members was killed , &quot; says Yacobus .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
needing Dubai Torch &apos;s pilgrim and already in the second time .
on Friday , there was one of the world &apos;s highest housing storms in Dubai , forcing hundreds of people to escape from this 337 metre and 79 regular buildings .
this is the second fire that has been ravaged in just two years , which is called on to happen in Turin , or Tusvikup .
the building was evacuated , none of the injuries were reported and there were no direct fire @-@ related causes .
&quot; we sleep and wake up to the fires and people &apos;s fears .
we would be waiting for a tree and we took around 10 minutes to get down the 50th order , &apos; said to the Reuterans one of the people who called himself George .
according to Dubai civil protection officers , fire fighters were also deleted at around 4 o &apos;clock in the morning at local level ( 00.00 GMT ) and jailed building .
the government said that they are working to shelter the victims .
this incident can once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on high @-@ level external soil in the world .
during the investigation carried out by the steering Board in Torch after the 2015 fire , it was found that the most damage was suffered by a façade - the decoral panels and isolation of the external surface .
the British police have said that they believe that the isolation of the London Grenportfolio Tower Tower and Ambassador panels could have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in June , which killed around 80 people .
see : these phones are likely to be sold in the autumn
language and coal are the time for technological games , because then telephone manufacturers will disclose their new models of excellence .
in the spring , Samsung Galaxy S8 , Huawei P10 and Sony XZ Premium came to sale , as well as in the autumn , new hitt telephones are expected .
according to the Tele2 marketing and sales Director , Christian Semother , today &apos;s flagship ships are characterised by an innovative design , an eye @-@ fast sner , a serser @-@ servani 4K resolution on the screen and the ultra @-@ fast process .
Samsung Galaxy S8 , which has also reached the front line of the Estonian smartphone , is a major elephant in the world of technology .
in the autumn , it will allow for a more tidal high @-@ speed charger , a more resilient , high @-@ quality cameras and greater water and customs security .
he added that , on the basis of rumours , you can already speculate and predict the four top models that are likely to be conquered by street sales .
these four smartphone excellence models will reach poelephants in the autumn of this year .
the long @-@ awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach polephants in mid @-@ September .
however , what the new Apple model looks like , and what it can do , is spreading a lot .
if the iPhone 7 did not lead to significant differences between iPhone 6s , Apple &apos;s tenth birthday is expected to see the new model completely separate from previous ones .
there has been talk of four colours : black , white , rock and chromium .
one of the elements of the new design is probably the screen , which covers the entire telephone front , has lost their homes and fingerprints have been built on the screens .
Apple &apos;s design director JonyIve demands that the new iPhone model look like a glass .
there has also been talk of the iPhone version .
in addition to the horizon , the unmanageable charging and even higher quality cameras can be expected to accelerate the A11 process .
it is certainly one of the expected smart phones for one year .
a new model of Galaxy is beginning on 23 August .
there has been a lot of rumours about what new Galaxy is going to see .
Admittedly , even more business users , and the S pen will allow even greater functionalities .
the Telefont should have two cameras , one of which is a lainurk and the other with the same narrow view of television content .
at the moment , no one knows what two of the cameras are capable of , but in any case , it is the first test of Samsung , which is certainly comparable to iPhone 8 in terms of quality .
however , we are looking forward to 23 August .
although Nokia has sold three smartphones in this year with Nokia 6 , there is still a lack of their flag - Nokia 8 , which is already being presented on 16 August .
we are looking forward to 5.3 @-@ dust screens and ultra @-@ fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processes and a more resilient apartment .
in the case of Nokia , there is also talk of aluminium corps and significant levels of water and customs security IP68 .
like Samsungevery , Nokia in the new model has two camera , which is produced by an optimist company Zeiss .
if Sony &apos;s firm flag has been XZ Premium so far , the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones will be added in the near future , with even more innovative functions .
we expect a smart phone that is slightly more modest than XZ Premium , but at least the same good or better cameras .
the new model of Sony has been speculated that its screen is at least hot .
what is the reality is that we can already see the right thing , because traditionally Sony has unveiled its autumn flag vessel , at the international level of IFRS , which will take place on 1 @-@ 6 September this year .
according to the transcripts leaked by telephone calls , Trump Mexico was forced to pay for the border wall .
the Washington post unveiled the telephone calls between US President Donald Trumpi and Mexican and Australian state leaders .
on 27 January , Enrique Pena Nieto , the President of Mexico , went to the President of Mexico , to put an end to public proclaiming that he does not intend to pay for the proposed border wall .
the American President , with him , with his public condemnation of the wall , said : &apos; you must not say this to the press &apos; .
the Trump set out his presidential campaign to build a long seller and the age of the southern border of the United States , so that Mexico is paying for this project .
the transcripts were also published in his first speech with the Australian Prime Minister , Malcolm Turnbull , which reveals a tense debate .
the Trump said to Mr Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take on refugees from Australia is &apos; ridiculous &apos; , &apos; nervous &apos; and &apos; stupid &apos; , and he said that the agreement that was made during the Obama Government would give him the impression of a &apos; guide &apos; , because he has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States .
the Trump ended the speech by telling the Turks that &apos; this was the most unpleasant speech of the day &apos; .
the Court of Justice did not take a complaint on the matter of the city of OC MRP in which the city of Tartu rejected their offer for bus and coach transport from July 2019 to 2029 .
this is a letter which was rejected by the OC MRP city of Tartu buses , as the offer did not meet the requirements , explained by Anneli Aputin , the President of the Tartu City Service .
this is the procurement of intra @-@ Tartu cities for the period 01.07.2019 @-@ 30.06.2029 .
the city of MRP Lidelegations referred to the Court of Justice for the decision of the Tartu District Court .
the national court did not take this process .
although many people in the social media complain that the Weekt Festival is disrupting their night and the whole city is full of driving brakes , there are also many who have no bad words about a lasting festival .
I am even positively surprised that the supermarket was so polite !
I did not see any confusion or courtesy .
even though I saw the word &apos; , a wonderful wave .
&quot; it is good that it is coming , there is , and it is known to be , the joy of the Persian , which has remained in winter , &quot; he will gladly add .
a wave of tyranny is not destroyed .
if , in the middle of the city , he is still listening to musicians being played in the rank , then the music has not yet arrived at his home .
&quot; but I hope that I hear , &apos; he will happily say &apos; .
Mrs Agnes , too , talks that the Grand festival is a good thing for the skies , which will make a good contribution to the turnover of local merchants .
in addition , it welcomes the fact that the summer capital has come up with such a great deal .
the woman of Peds is not a woman .
although I am no longer in the rank , but it is nice that rand has revived .
and it is good that the people are moving and that has been the case three times , &apos; says a woman .
in the first case , I think it was a little worse .
&apos;then perhaps there were complaints &apos; , he is wondering .
however , what is happening in the beaches is normal for the summer capital cities .
&quot; this Weekise is a very good prophmo for our small city , &quot; says Harri , who is hiding in the park .
life and möll have also not been sounding his life .
but for that ?
we should all pull together .
think about how it would be better to communicate between nations .
after all , the music man is not black .
that is not the case , although I live near there .
&apos;Well people are able to save and there is no paint &apos; , he will speak .
the guests who have come to the skies are , he said , visas .
&quot; with the bottles they have , of course , joined a little , but young people are young people and the issance - let us go , but be people and we can do it ! &apos; says .
the people who have travelled to this end have been travelling away , whether to relatives or to acquaintances .
&quot; however , in general , the Festival has a positive impact on people like this melu , &quot; talks with children in Tiina .
his family , too , is not distracted by the Festival , even though it has gone even further than it last year .
last summer , we heard more .
we are living in a city outside that , in fact , there is a lot of room for the Persian river , &apos; he is talking about it .
Pearson cuts 3 000 jobs and reduces dividends to revitalise business
the British education company Pearson said on Friday that more than 3 000 jobs are being cut and reduces its interim dividends by 72 % , by launching another restructuring programme to tackle the threat of business .
the jobs that are being created , according to John Fallon , are likely to be made redundant at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019 , will be accompanied by 4 000 posts lost during the previous restructuring process .
Pearson announced in May a plan to cut costs by another GBP 300 million ( USD 394 million ) under the third cost reduction programme ( USD 394 million ) in order to try to revive business , which has been hit by the transition to digital learning .
the company , which agreed to sell last month &apos;s participation in the Penguin Random House to its partner companies Bertelsmann , said that their expectation in relation to the year has not changed since the 1 % increase in sales revenue was announced in the first half of the year to 2.05 billion .

terrorist attack in Kabul : suicide attack killed by NATO soldiers
the suicide bomber , according to officials , attacked military convoys in the capital of Afghanistan in Kabul , killing one NATO soldier and wounded several of you .
the NATO statement said that five soldiers and interpreters were injured .
according to local reports , the city of Qarabaghi has also been killed by three civilians .
this bombing is the last acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in the Herati mosque attack .
on Monday , two people were killed in Kabul near the Iraqi embassy .
the NATO statement said that an explosion took place on Thursday evening when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by &apos; man @-@ made explosive body &apos; .
according to the statement , everything has been injured in a stable state and is treated in the US military hospital in Bagram .
according to the Correspondents , the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic state ( in Vietnam ) , are a serious source of concern for the forces in Baghdad in Qarabaghi .
according to the UN , at least 1662 civilians have died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , the car bomb in Kabul mainly killed at least 30 people in Kabul .
according to the Taliban , they were behind the attack .
on 31 May , more than 150 people were killed in the middle of a major bomb attack , which is the most deadly military attack in the country since the US @-@ led forces were reluctant by the Taliban in 2001 .
this violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , while the President of the United States , Donald Trump , is considering whether to increase the number of US military and police forces .
according to the correspondent , the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public confidence crisis in the government , its policies and , in particular , President Ashraf Ghan .
the EPA repealed the decision to postpone the regulation after the sharks .
the United States Environment Protection Agency ( United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA ) annulled the decision to delay the introduction of the Obama Regulation , which obliges states to limit emissions from the summer , one day after the 15 states complained to the Court of Justice .
the EPA announced the decision to proceed late on Wednesday 2015 , saying that it shows the Agency &apos;s commitment to cooperation with states .
&quot; we believe that we need to engage in dialogue with our national partners and listen to them , &quot; said Scott Pruitt in a statement by the head of the EPA .
the Pruitt had announced the intention of the EPA in June to postpone the rates of shareholder content to be measured in different parts of the country in order to determine where its level should be reduced by one year to meet the highest standard of air quality in 2018 .
the 15 mainly democratic states , together with Columbia , submitted an action on Tuesday , saying that this decision is illegal .
the government of President Donald Trumpi has tried to withdraw a number of environmental regulations imposed by the former President Barack Obama , which , according to Trumpi , is part of a broader plan for growth .
however , these efforts have led to the reactions of the democrats and nature conservation groups , who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health .
the EPA website states that the breathing of air containing ozone can reduce the ability of lung to work and increase the risk of respiratory diseases , such as asthma .
German pigs can come from pigs .
Germany &apos;s pigs and cattle can come with pipes , as strong rain is threatening the European Union &apos;s second largest producer of wheat , writes Banimal berg .
this year , it can be said that weeks of saturation before harvesting may mean that the fruit intended for the bread industry is only feeding animals .
&quot; the quality of the content is far worse than the soil and worse than in 2015 , &quot; said Agravis Raiffeen &apos;s analysis of Mr Bernhard Chilla .
this year , up to 40 per cent of German nourishment , which is fed compared to the usual , is forecast in Agravis .
the German farmers , like their European colleagues , have been exposed to any weather this year .
first of all , the winter was too dry .
then there was a cold spring , which was replaced by heat waves in June .
in July , Germany hit Germany , which has also continued in August .
many eyes have been turned to northern Germany , where the rain hinders harvesting .
so far , only five per cent of the nightmare .
the majority in the region has not yet been harvested , the local harvest purchaser in Ceravis .
&quot; this is quite a difficult day , &quot; said Frank Deckert Rendsburg , the senior trader in Ceravis .

Msole y Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time , discuss possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mlony Garcia , who should be on a collision course in order to face up to 66.7 kg in the most attractive poker in the near future , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in the ESPN office in LOS Angelein , until Garcia , the winner of the World Bounch Council , at the other end of the corridor , to welcome Lomachenkot , World Bounch sulgweighch .
following the unanimous decision of the Garcia , the victory of the former four @-@ time world champion , Adrien Broner , on Saturday in Showtime , both combatants belong to the top of the table .
Mr Garcia extended his better hand and said : &apos; how does the summer go , the champion ?
I wish you every success . &quot;
Lomachenko will protect his belts against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 19 ESPN .
when a couple of photographs were present , Lomachenko &apos;s memory , Eg Klimas , said that a possible confrontation between the militants would be &apos; perfect &apos; .
&quot; I am a former consultant , &quot; recalled Garcia .
&quot; I called for Broner &#91; 63.5 kg &#93; , but I am not so big .
I am small about 63.5 kg .
I want to move downwards .
and he must move towards a lighter weight &#91; 61.2 kg &#93; and then we can fight .
the Fans have requested this .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lomachenko agreed .
&quot; the world needs this fight . &quot;
in the climate , the question raised was whether it should be worthwhile to look at it , and it is part of its strategy that he wants to allow the Lomachenkol to debate the end of this year with 61.2 kg in the class to make it possible for the next summer to meet with Garcia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 novans ) , who also have an interest in combating Jorge Linarese and Luke Campbelli &apos;s match with the winner of the Foruum of 23 September .
&quot; looking at this fight could be worthwhile , as the fans have called for this confrontation , &quot; said Garcia , saying later that he is open to fighting any channel that offers the best financial package .
&quot; we are key players .
no other name is able to attract so much attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Mr Garcia said that he must see Lomachenkot as &apos; troops &apos; and can go to his desk on Saturday .
however , Lomachenko was modest in praising Garcia , saying that he felt that the three diviss from the Riverpool were &apos; very slow &apos; ; I apologise , Mlony ... you wanted it to be nodistant .
according to Garcia , the aim was to show strength and then to boy .
both confirmed that they feel that the tension between them is increasing .
&quot; this is the fight that awaits the realisation .
no other confrontation does not bring so much attention and slander .
I am more than willing to work on this , &quot; said Garcia .
Lomachenko said : &apos; I have been waiting for the best fighters and Mlony is just that .
this is a good fight . &quot;
what are the world &apos;s events going to Estonia ?
it extended and issued a record of more than 13 000 residence permits for third @-@ country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia to work , study or family .
if , for example , the soil was decided to issue a fixed @-@ term residence permit for 6702 foreigners , the figure was 4928 .
the agencies cannot say how many immigrants will finally remain in Estonia , but this analysis will be drawn up in the Ministry of the Interior .
when nearly 500 Ukrainians per year ago in Estonia a year ago , this figure will close to 2 000 in recent years .
the number of applicants for a residence permit increased exponentially during the Ukrainian crisis - in 2014 , 1087 people were granted a fixed @-@ term residence permit , up to 675 .
according to the statistical office , we have the highest number of Ukrainian citizens in Estonia - 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia more than left .
&quot; the Ukrainian community has had a great deal of time in Estonia and , due to difficult circumstances in the country , it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many of the family are already in front of the family , the spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior , Kristin Rammus .
the number of Ukrainian citizens who have been granted a fixed @-@ term residence permit was even higher than the number of Russian citizens , even though in 10 years the most fixed @-@ term residence permits have been issued .
if the Ukrainians come to work here , Russia &apos;s citizens will be on family migration .
&quot; in view of this historic Russian community , they are also more likely to have the greatest family ties with the people living in Russia , &quot; said Helina Meuse , the Internal Protection Academy .
&quot; if you look at where the Russian citizens who have been able to live in the country of residence have moved to , then , after Harjuland , the East Viruland is immediately , he added and pointed out that around 40 % of them have been married with the citizens of the European Union .
the Multi @-@ term residence permit received 1696 Russian citizens , which is also a record number .
at the same time , the number of Russians who wanted to extend the residence permit decreased .
&quot; compensation is due to the fact that , instead of extending the residence permit , a new residence permit has been requested to be established permanently in Estonia , &quot; explained by the press representative of the Ministry of the Interior , Ramon , who said that the interest of Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit has remained stable for years .
a new residence permit for Estonia will be able to apply for at least three years for foreigners who have been living here since last year .
its aim is to encourage the emancipation of people who have been adapted .
however , a long @-@ term residence permit requires five years , for example .
for the new residence permit , the extension of the old residence permit has obviously been reduced .
for example , the soil was granted a residence permit for 146 Ukrainians who have been working here for at least three years .
the Ukrainians will now be able to change their work and the Estonian state will no longer be pointing the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met .
this residence permit became popular - applicants are still holders of a grey passport ( 1029 ) , Russians ( 487 ) , individuals ( 54 ) and nigerans ( 36 ) .
a total of 1968 people , including 23 Americans , 12 Egyptians , 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese , were able to live in Estonia for the purpose of residence .
the first half of this year has already been set at 1269 .
in 10 years , surprisingly , Nigeria has become a country whose citizens are one of the most active applicants for the Estonian residence permit .
when three residence permits were issued in 2007 , the soil was 200 .
there are lessons to be learned from Nigeria in this university .
Estonia &apos;s higher education institutions are also popular , for example , among Georgians , the Chinese and the Turks .
the number of citizens of India , Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased largely thanks to learning games .
for them , too , the rule is that where the community has arisen , there will be more easily others &apos; , in addition to Ramallah .
in ten years , two people have also moved to Estonia , for example , from North Korea , as much from Laos and Madagascar .
ten people have come here from Cuba , 231 South Korea , 40 Indonesia and four Uruguay .
if around 6 000 third @-@ country nationals receive a residence permit a year , it is about 0.46 % of the total population .
even if the citizens of the European Union are concerned , migration will remain around a percentage , &quot; commented on the fact that the figures are in fact small .
in total , 14 822 people died in Estonia , according to the statistical office , 13 792 .
this means that immigration exceeded the second year of emigration .
most of them are the citizens of Estonia , but more of them are among those who leave them .
this is why Estonia &apos;s citizens &apos; migration secret with 2 000 people was in decline .
Estonians , in particular , migrate between Finland and Estonia .
Mlong Couture Princess of Couture tricks with sats , chickens and tweed
however , in the North West of ideas , Maria Tammeoru , there is history - old painting and defendants : &apos; I can dream of a few hours somewhere in the museum and admire the old @-@ fashioned thieves .
if you are going to do something , you will study and learn about it every day .
this is a joy of discovery !
the world of Couture , which is long ago , may seem to be alien to some , but the designer does not think so .
you yourself decide how much you are in your life !
as a friend , I have a friend , who has a whole sail full of the couture of the sharks that I have created .
because , and it is not his fault , he does not live in the Hollywood and does not go on a red bed every day , he wants to wear the most beautiful brokers , and he is suffering !
you can live a special life for their lives .
the artist does not recognise the gap between the shining events and the grey day .
it is this reasoning that put the rolling stock in Estonia into rural areas , between forests and fields , to people , who often do not reach the mood .
for example , the College was presented in comparison , for example , in Jair , and at the yardstick , where 45 modell Royal defilee filled the whole street .
in Tallinn , there is often a shop in a shop , a young person , but there are more emotions elsewhere - slogvo , rising up , you want to thank you .
a large part of the audience was just as news , but now they are the fans of the Mlong Couture .
if you overshoot people &apos;s expectations , they are spirited !
and I like this feeling that I am in my motive like the summer .
Pernus was a 50 @-@ metre red carpet , a whole street full of stickers , it seemed that they would not come to an end !
Mrs Maria also does not recognise the motive that animal creation must be presented by a superficial superficial , she will be happy to bring ordinary women .
I often call on my own customers - they have always been happy .
that is , after all , the experience , the island of the ice curtain , which was wonderful .
I am so sorry that I myself have never seen my role , always behind the ground , to give things the last meat as a hopeless act .
my nervous would not allow calmly to look at the Chamber .
Mrs Maria is this type of motto , who does not just want to play a representative role , but to be involved in everything .
I have my sister machine , most of the collections myself .
I like the whole process , where you play with details , to discover .
I am never far from my animal , and I am not afraid of work .
it is not limited to any matter , but also to the style , logistics , organisation , organisation - everyone has to jump off the day of a woman &apos;s day .
for these hours of work , the fanatics are still enormously .
I cannot say when my working day ends , for me it is just a day full of joy !
I have been very lucky - it is like an unstoppable joke : I do something beautiful , man gets something beautiful and , in turn , compliments .
it has been said many times that my brokers have a land - they make themselves feel like a printing .
the guerrilous lines that Maria talents made overnight have long been a signal of Couture signalling to date .
Mr Martin Myrsep U18 boys : the weapon of the Estonians was now turned against us .
the damage , the fairytale , ran out .
the first thing was that we did not get our table .
and if there is such a big difference in the table , there is nothing to do with the Estonian U18 corvpallipots 61 : 75 in Britain , our only NBRA has played a corvball , BC Kalev / Cramo abitreener Martin Myrsep .
opponents adopted 28 Palace and received so much more attacks from the wave of attacks .
we were also not prepared for their aggressive defence or attack , it created .
many of the attacks on the English people ended in three to five seconds , we were unable to build protection .
however , in defence , they were able to keep their hands everywhere , we could not combine .
it created the team from its feet .
the anti @-@ domestic work was better done .
according to Myrsepa , Estonia would have to make more tactical errors in order to take up the anti @-@ insurgency .
the last quarter - we had a zero mistake , but the opponents have already received a number of quick harvests .
Inadmissibility and a close offensive , which was our weapon in the alagropil , now all of us were opposed to .
today we did not have the strength of their aggressive behaviour .
the Myrlap remained satisfied with its negligence in Kalevis , Matthias Tass .
security in general can say good words about the whole team , to date there was a single blow to the whole of the team .
it is a pity that such an aggressive response has not been met earlier .
Tass has always been self @-@ confident and played out today , but it seemed that he was tired - he has borne quite a heavy burden .
however , he made a very fine move , which I have seen in the past in the past , &apos; , in addition to the lead .
the terrible figures : the EM @-@ turnir concentration threw less than 10 points ...
the U18 age class does not only apply to the young men B @-@ divisjon corvpalliturniir in Tallinn , who started in Dublin yesterday .
and Estonia &apos;s game with Poland , unfortunately , is in the area of antiquity .
Estonia lost 25 : 65 , but still after the third quarter , there was 9 : 49 , or only in the last ten minutes , opponents of the gas family and 16 : 16 : 16 .
both in the first and second quarter , Estonia 4 , third point ...
at the same time , in the first two minutes , the Estonians hit two pieces of the first two pieces , but there are 25 pieces of the game , then one of the trialogues , and then 21 others ...
perhaps in almost half an hour , 47 fingers were taboo .
in addition , 2 points came from four non @-@ negotiable .
there was a reasonable number of losses in this time , 12 .
at the end of the game , Poland was 33 and Estonia had 13 % ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has started with two losses , on the opening day , to recognise Portugal &apos;s 83 : 56 better .
NATO vessels came to Tallinn to complement the stocks
today , the NATO @-@ 1 permanent group of mines arrived in Tallinn for a week &apos;s planned port visit to Tallinn , in order to supplement the stocks of ships and prepare for pre @-@ presumed habits .
in the course of the visit , ships are preparing for the landing of the sea , giving crews the opportunity for a paaritable holiday .
after the visit , NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters in order to carry out a number of exercises and to be ready for future historical explosive operations .
&quot; the participation of Estonians in NATO and their co @-@ operation in local waters is a good illustration of our integration with the allied forces , &quot; said Arto Reinland , the chief of the operation and planning of the overseas fleet .
since 29 June , NATO will run a permanent mine group from the Latvian naval group , Gvido Laudups , who took over the tasks of a group of Estonian naval officers at a ceremony in Riga from the captenant Johan @-@ Elias Seljab .
the group &apos;s flag vessel is LVNS Virsaitis , a Latvian naval force , which also operates as a group leader .
this semester is also part of the Estonian naval mine meal and anti @-@ Caspian region .
as one of the four groups of NATO naval forces under the auspices of NATO , NATO is a permanent mine group of primary rapid reaction teams , which can be sent to different parts of the world within five days .
4 . - On 13 August , the Pirita monastery &apos;s mutur &apos;s silence will once again become a place where Birgitta Festival has been carried out 13 years ago by Maestro Eri Klasta .
this year &apos;s Birgitta Festival can be beautiful , powerful and unprecedented , according to the Festival of the artistic leader of the city of Birgitta Festival .
the risk to Joost : Cuba will reach the class of the &apos; Traviata &apos; and &apos; Tosca &apos; , &apos; balletilae &apos; and &apos; Carlssonin &apos; , and there is also no shortage of its own production , which is , this time , Joseph Haydn &apos;s wonderful orchestra &apos; Aastatimes &apos; , by the same international creative team , who brought the Pirita to the Hague in 2015 . &quot;
Mrs Festival has much more than just concerts and theatre answers .
it is more than any music theatre in its normal form .
it is a festival that takes power and never gets rid of it .
because experience , which can be heard in this superior and salvable environment , puts human soul and concerns human beings in a way that cannot be described .
for the first year , you are the art leader of Birgitta Festival .
did the maestro Eri Klaskins not feel a little big ?
of course , as I had a very personal relationship with Mr Klaus , there has been a lot of help .
he went through my entire student career and also supported a career in the beginning of the adjustment .
perhaps it is thanks to this that it is easier for me to continue his work .
in Klas , so much good and , of course , it will be passed on to Burma &apos;s Festival team .
it was excellent to join a team who knows exactly how things are going .
it is precisely the great heart of Eri Kars , who also gave me the strength to go ahead with the Festival of Tallinn in harmony with Burma .
and here I am now and I can do it !
what could the audience at the Festival today , which you offer in particular ?
we have artists from England , Latvia , Lithuania and , as a surprise , the first ballett , written by Mrs Lindgreni , will come to the fore .
this is &apos; Karlsson lent &apos; .
and one of the notorious nuances in this regard is that the author of this ballel is the Latvian composer , Juris Karlsons , who himself expressed a desire to write it .
apparently , he has already lived in the Carlsson of Karlsson .
to the risk , how are you all the nuances ?
thanks to my support for life , I certainly do .
this work needs a system of support and a lot of love , and it is fortunate to me .
and I have noticed that my personal emotions do not depend so much on the other people , as I do myself , in other words , how I am going against every new day .
and this awareness of the tone , the preservation of the positive nature and , in fact , the naming of ourselves in the mirror of the morning , has made a significant increase in my happy percentage .
in particular , this week , when the most important tests are , I have been particularly keen to practise it and it works .
the naming of oneself is an act of amusing and raising the tone .
that is not just a word .
I think that people are not yet aware of the body that the universe offers to them , but each of them will be able to discover it slowly .
right now , it is an important moment .
is there any ritual before the dirigend has been taken ?
there are still , clothing must be replaced against more convenient .
this is a small moment for ourselves .
however , in general , I do not have the opportunity to make a pump or a small straw before .
in fact , I even like to engage actively with people , even before the dirigendium took place .
but come to the Festival of Birgitta , what is also to be discovered here is not particularly large @-@ scale and balleans .
see a stark video with the risk of Joostiga !
new results of the assessment of the age of Swedish asylum applicants were published
in Sweden , among the asylum applicants , the most recent results of the tests show that more than 80 % of the constitution was assessed by the parents than 18 , but not all of them believe in the accuracy of the results .
the Swedish National Institute for medicine ( Romtsmedicinalverket ) started with tests at the beginning of this year .
the tests were set up in order to assess the age of age more accurately , after the Swedish Authority for Migration ( IOM ) criticised for failing to correctly determine the age of many allegedly minors .
up to now , 68 cases have been sent to the tests by Migransver , and the Institute for medicine has issued a total of 24 81 tests between mid @-@ March 2017 and 31 July .
Eighty per cent ( 2002 ) were assessed for 18 @-@ year @-@ old or older , and in 25 cases , the Institute of medicine assessed that the test &quot; may be 18 @-@ year @-@ old or older . &quot;
the 432 cases concluded that the person is &apos; probably younger than 18 &apos; .
the tests will only be used if the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Göransson , the Institute of Justice , the results are consistent with those of previous months .
&quot; we do not see a great difference compared with the statistics in previous months , the numbers are quite consistent , &apos; he said to the newspaper The Local .
the fact that a large proportion of cases were assessed as an older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have been able to choose their age .
the Institute issued the results of the 581 test in May and said that in 442 cases &apos; there are references to the fact that a researcher is 18 @-@ year @-@ old or older &apos; .
however , when the newspaper Svensson ska Dagbladet examined the results of their 581 test , it became clear that in 243 cases , a person had declared directly that this year would be 18 .
this medical age assessment method , which is carried out by röntgeniters of smart meters and fields of MRT , and then they will be allowed to be analysed by dental doctors and radiologists , has been criticised in some circles .
one of the sceptics is the endokrinologist of the Karolinska Institute , Claude Marcus , whose work includes an assessment of people &apos;s biological maturity in order to find out whether they went through the normal audience sooner or later .
&quot; I have had reason to think about this and I do not think that the measurement method currently used should be used .
the designation of biological age in this way is very uncertain .
if we cannot say firmly , we should not pretend that we can , &apos; he said &apos; to the newspaper &apos; forestry .
but Johan Göransson , the Institute of medicine , defended the accuracy of the tests : &apos; in general , it can be said that the risk of inaccurate adults is low .
most of all , perhaps around 10 % of the risk is if the person is a little under 18 . &quot;

the 20 @-@ year @-@ old newer , Anna Maria Orel , made the London MMil beautiful debate , with 67.3737with a good 18 seats .
Mr Orel was MM noorim and a joyful woman confirmed that he hopes to fight for medals in the future .
the contest went well and received good experience .
with the first test ( 64.80 ) , I immediately made my medium @-@ term result , the second ( 62.80 ) risk too much and the third ( 67.37 ) I have been able to keep it very clear , &quot; said Orel after the contest .
I had my own emissions and I am very pleased that I found it .
Anna Maria Oreli MM &apos;s debate ended with a good 18 seats .
the Vihmasadu Orelit did not mix , because he is training him through the TEC stage .
&apos;I am afraid &apos; , he said a little bit .
the London Olympic Games had almost a full house of the people , did the Orel reclaim people or were able to turn themselves off ?
I was in a positive sense , but in a positive sense .
everyone says that it will add - that is the case !
if it is to compete , it can be experienced .
he then confirmed that he will be satisfied with the MM debate and he is still waiting for a great deal of good competition : &apos; I came here with the 32nd outcome of this year &apos;s season , the final outcome , I finished 18 .
this is a very good result .
I am 20 years old and Mil - that is the only thing that counts .
I take a good experience and , in some days , I want to compete on behalf of the medals .
Western Virgina kuberner announced party exchanges
the Governor of the Western Virginia Democrat , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening , together with President Trumpa , that he will change the parties .
&quot; this or not , but the democrats walked away from me , &quot; said Governor Justice .
&quot; today , I say to you , having vetoed and thought ... today , I say to you , the West , that I cannot help you as a democratic Governor . &quot;
at the mercy of the sitting , the devil is happy .
&quot; so I will be a Republican tomorrow , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a engineer , I would say to you that it is time to play a second game . &quot;
the Trump had pledged a major announcement in the past at the meeting of Western Virginia .
Trump won 42 points in Western Virginia and Justice did not support the candidate for the democrats , Hillary Clinton .
Justice , which is the only billion star in the state , according to the Ford , proved to be elected in 2016 .
in the wilderness , it notes that it is owned by coal mines in five states and that it is quite self @-@ employed by coal .
his value is approximately USD 1.59 billion .
at the same time , on Thursday evening , the Republican National Committee ( RNC ) published a statement that &apos; the party exchange of Governor Justice is yet another blow to a democratic parade that would rather prevent the country from improving again than working on it &apos; .
&quot; just 15 months , and control of the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice &apos;s announcement is simply the most recent wake @-@ up to you , which is the way to the end of the day and cannot find a positive and united message , &quot; said RNC representation , Ronna McDaniel statement CBS Newsi .
it is not surprising that , where there are many people , there are also many injured .
Urmet , who is in office in the Weekise medical axis yesterday , said that the posters have had to be distributed quite a lot .
Vills and marches are fundamental , excuses and easy fall .
of course , it is also the case , in absentia and shoes .
according to Urmeti , visitors will come to the festival with false footwear and so the problems will come .
the media have also had to help visitors with a few major injuries - there have been some panic and also one of the footwear .
we have also made a blessing when someone has done a hand or a finger .
we are doing less here , we are going to send a hospital .
see the video as to whether the brakes on the media would also ask for a painkiller .
Coe praised the honest apologies of the Russians for the anti @-@ doping scandal .
the international rally of the Kergean , Sebastian Coe , praised , according to his words , &apos; Russia &apos;s honest apology &apos; for the &apos; doping &apos; scandal , but reiterated that it is not time to allow sport to be returned to the country .
at the eve of the World Cup on Dmitry Shylachtin , the Russian frivoltator , the IAAF Congress , said that the ban on the competition imposed on his country is right and has a firm aim to combat doping .
he has apologised for &apos; all the lighters of gold and silver medals &apos; in competitions . &quot;
despite his comments , the IAAF Congress voted in favour of leaving the ban on the entry into force of the competition which was introduced in November 2015 after the report by the World Anti @-@ Doping Agency ( WADA ) found evidence of state @-@ sponsored doping in Russia .
&quot; I think it was a very honest answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IAAF President Coe to journalists .
&quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress were satisfied that the Russian Federation also recognised that they have had quite difficult times and they are doing everything possible to restructure the Union . &quot;
according to Coe , he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for self @-@ determination .
&quot; I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is taking place , but Congress supports the proposal for a working group that this is not the right time to withdraw Russia , &quot; said Coe .
&quot; we must do everything possible in the next few months to normalise the situation .
we have always been guided by the principle that we want clean athletes to be separated from the system , &apos; he added .
Eighteen Russian lighters who meet the strict criteria of the IAAF are competing with neutral athletes in London on Friday .
the head of the IAAF Group , Rune Andersen , said on Monday that Russia does not yet meet a number of criteria for forecasting .
following a presentation by the IAAF to the Council , he told journalists in London that doping control is still insufficient and that trained engineers are still operating freely .
the electric car revolution makes a significant difference to the demand for metals .
who are the winners and losers ?
little because the revolution in electric cars makes a significant difference to the fuel market up to infrastructure , it also creates new winners and losers in the metal market .
although mining giants like Glencore can say that they will win from one place and lose another , smaller mining companies will not help .
at the moment , Glencore coal and oil , but in the era of electric cars , there will be a growing demand for cobalt , lithium , copper , aluminium and nickel .
this year , the decisions of the UK , France and Norway , which allow the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be banned in the coming decades , have contributed to the spread of electric cars .
therefore , Volvo has already been aware that they are planning to abandon the combustion engine , and Tesla will bring a cheaper country 3 electric car to the market .
Banimal berg , according to the New Energy Finance forecasts , electric cars are already sold over two decades more than cars using oil @-@ produced fuels .
&quot; for some metals , this will change everything , &quot; said Simona Gambranini Banimal berg .
we have already seen a major impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium , which have increased demand for years .
in electric cars , there are approximately three times more copper than in the ordinary car , the Glencore .
even more answers are needed at charging stations , which is why the Exane BNP Paris estimates that it will increase the demand for around 5 % by 2025 .
the increase in demand for electric cars means additional lithium , cobalt , graphite and manganese demand .
the Glencore can increase the profits of electric cars from copper prices and the fact that there is the world &apos;s largest producer of cobalt , forecast Jeffitative Group .
according to this broker company , the winners of the second wave of electric cars will be winners of Fbete @-@ McMoRan and First Quanmas Minerals .
the market is already reacting to a changing trend .
this year , 70 % of the London metal stock exchange rate has been mixed .
the price of soil was 37 % .
the answer has also been 14 % this year , mainly due to economic growth .
the Glencore excise duty rose by 20 % in London , having exceeded the price rise to the rival Rio Tinto Group , BHP Billitoni and Anglo .
on the side of the losers , lead companies such as Recyclex and Campine , who have to adapt to a new era .
the main end @-@ use of the Plii is the batteries of petrol and diesel cars with the influx of cars .
electric cars are used by glaciers .
&quot; this is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found for other purposes , which could overcome the fall in demand , &quot; said Michael Widmer , the Bank of America Merrill Lynch , the head of analysis of the metallic market .
the impact of the Plii price movement has not yet been noticed in the form of a seamless trend .
the Plii is 17 % this year , with the best methane metal in London among the main industrial metals .
investors will see problems for metal in the future .
&quot; I am not sure that it is so bad for lead , because cheap oil keeps ordinary cars in competition , &quot; said Herwig Schmidt , the head of the metal company Triland Metalsi .
if the lead demand falls , it will be slow .
this may be the case in about ten years &apos; time .
in the meantime , stricter emission standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars , which is more frequent dependent on advanced lead @-@ based batteries , will be assessed by international lead and by the investigative organisation .
Kergmetallic , like aluminium , is replaced by steel , as a lighter car can go beyond electricity .
this explains the additional minimum demand of 1.6 million tonnes from 2013 to 2016 .
this represents 2.7 % of the world &apos;s output of aluminium .
this trend is likely to grow , says Widmer .
Aluminium is responsible for 13 % this year , as the growing demand for car manufacturers has led to a market deficit .
steel producers do not .
the blockade is working with General Motors to use nanotechnology for the production of wonderful cars .
ArcelorMittal and ShalEurope are also trying to develop a lighter meltdown in order to oppose the minimum .
&quot; a strong steel should be the answer to this development , &quot; said Exane BNP Paris , Sylvain Brunet .
there is some progress in Europe .
the end of the oil era can also bring suffering to a plate .
it took around half of this precious metal diesel engine as a catalyst for cars , announced by the metal refiner Johnson Matta .
&quot; many of the high @-@ demand raw materials such as oil and plate may not have a great deal of demand in the future , &quot; said Bernard Dahdah .
this does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important , but their importance will change over 15 years .
the Plaatinatmakers believe continued demand for diesel hybrid cars .
Mr Marc Grynberg , leader of the Uncore , said that in 2025 , more hybrid cars will continue to be sold from cars .
the great hope of the Plaatinatatmakers in the 10 @-@ year perspective is Toyota Motors and Hymuni Motosi , based on hydrogen @-@ based cars , which depend on a poster to produce electricity from hydrogen .
so far , however , this technology has not yet been commercially justified .
&quot; it seems to be a clear losers on the road to electric cars , &quot; said Exane BNP Paris from Brunet .
German car manufacturers received a major setback in July , as Stuttgart &apos;s court banned the use of diesel in the city of Mercedes @-@ Benz and Porsche .
how football &apos;s financial rules affect the transition to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing the rampant spending of European football clubs do not prevent the world &apos;s record transition from the Spanish football club to the Barcelona club Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences for UEFA , the governing body , which dominates the European game and in its power to ban teams from the prestigious League of Meisters , are still waiting for the Paris Saint @-@ GerMay .
the financial rules for the fair play of UEFA in 2011 ( FFP ) mean that the PSG will have to prove at some point that the transition to Neyra was funded without a huge loss .
EUR 222 million were paid to Barcelona ( USD 262 million ) alone for buying the Brazilians out of his contract , and the salary of Neyra will reach tens of millions of dollars per year .
here are some of the financial aspects of moving to the French club .
the PSG is undoubtedly possible for the recruitment of Mrs Neyra and for adding such money to the cloak of its stars , given that the team is funded by the family governing the Katar of Energy .
clubs have been allowed to spend a lot of money to recruit players , but they have to balance this with legal sources of income that allow them to come out of a football business .
FFFP was set up by Michel Platini after he was elected President of UEFA in 2007 .
this former French player believed that clubs , who are in the search for success in large debt , are actually dealing with fraud and risk buying when banks or owners should give up their support .
since 2011 , the FFP club will focus on monitoring their losses instead of their debts .
this change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich used first in 2003 in Chelsea - to buy a club with the potential and then to make huge costs to make the team better and to create a global brand - is more difficult to implement .
during the current three @-@ year evaluation period of the FFP , which runs until 2018 , the clubs will be able to bear the losses of up to EUR 30 million .
and despite the fact that Platini was discredited by the presidential office in 2015 , his UEFA successor , Alexander Ceferin , is still committed to preventing excessive spending .
&quot; FFFP is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules , &quot; said the previous week , Mr Andrea Traverso , who is the guardian of UEFA &apos;s FFP .
although the PSG for the purchase clause of Neymari as one of the full payments , they will be able to distribute this amount for the purposes of accounting for the entire duration of the agreement .
Mr Neymar concluded a five @-@ year agreement , which is why it is possible to show a transitional fee of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years .
for the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , the PSG , together with Abu Dhabi , received the most severe penalties on Manchester Cityga .
the PSG was fined EUR 60 million ( currently 82 million dollar ) , which was reduced later to EUR 20 million , and the club was required to limit the team of the League of Meisters for the 2014 @-@ 2015 season to 21 players instead of 25 .
UEFA is looking for clubs who can try to regulate the financial institutions , blowing their income through companies connected with the owners of the club .
the company of Qatar may sponsor the PSG , but if the value of sponsorship is considered to be standard market rates , UEFA would not allow it to be counted as official income .
this was the case in 2014 , when UEFA decided that Qatar tourism Authority had the value of the PSG support .
it has been said that a certain part of the PSG services can come from Qatar through contributions from the World Cup Board of 2022 .
however , the PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neyra could become a world championship and claim that UEFA &apos;s regulatory authorities are able to easily expose such manoeuvres .
the penalties previously imposed on the PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant with regard to any attempt to ignore the rules .
the people familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA has not been proactive in discussing the transition with the PSG .
they talked about the associated forum , provided that their anonymity is guaranteed , because they are not allowed to discuss the situation in the PSG .
the latest reports show that the PSG 2015 @-@ 2016 season will generate more than € 10 million in profits of around € 542.4 million .
the figures for the last financial year have not yet been published .
the PSG hopes that the arrival of Neyra will have a good impact on sponsorship transactions , trade and snus .
the club looks forward to an increase of at least 30 per cent of the turnover of the agreement .
Spain too , having clearly irritated the departure of one of the largest football stars , tried to prevent the transition by claiming that the PSG is in breach of FFP .
&quot; this is a clear case of &apos; financial doping &apos; with a club and a country , &quot; said La li President Javier Tebas AS , referring to the fact that the PSG belongs mainly to Qatar .
the Arsenal mountain , Archger Wenger , whose club belongs to the American sports magnate , shares the view that the state finances the club .
&quot; this is the result of property rights and it has completely changed the whole football landscape over the last 15 years , &quot; said Wenger on Thursday .
&quot; if a club belongs to a country , everything can be done .
it is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play , as the country may have other ways or other interests to represent such a major player . &quot;

today , 50 years ago , the orchestrated storm in Estonia , which foiled houses and windows .
the orchestra of the century , which , on 6 and 7 August , caused major damage in particular to the West , Harjuland and Raplaland .
in the course of these days in Estonia , the wind was over 30 m / s .
in my old drink in Bavaria , a handful of bottles from one card to another , and overlaps with them to support them .
everything was blind and ragne , like the world stage .
Taamal has already been knocking on houses , in 2002 , the old Mrs Linda Kurova , recalled the magazine of Estonian nature in an interview with Estonia .
the Linda spouse saw how the planted axes collapsed .
but what are you going to do with your hands , where are you going against such a storm ?
the sea came under the window , from the windows in the water , &apos; Haapsalus Kalda , who has lived on the streets , spoke of Mrs Linda at the time .
the fact that the roads were full and the rock of the railway station had been flying to 20 @-@ 30 metres , Linda most of the Haitians , just like the next morning .
according to the local authorities , the cages behind the Paralepa were lagging behind , some of the very long @-@ term , some boys .
everyone saw very depressing , the storm went through the beautiful old trees as a radar and pragmatism , like war .
Western Viruland was not particularly badly affected by August 1967 , compared with the West Estonia , but the losses were large there , the Viruland Official Journal wrote in 2007 .
Haapsalu Lfossil Park and Padise Park were swept away from the ground , but also our own parks were severely affected .
in Tallinn , the wind was measured by up to 35 metres per second , or around 130 kilometres per hour .
in Tallinn Meriexpression was one of the tears of lead in the evening of 6.August : &apos; mother , mother !
the channel is in the air and no longer , &quot; wrote Virumaa Official Journal .
at the time of the storm in Viljandiland , the concept of the generational building was so that it was decided to be dismantled later .
the August pipeline did not have to be opposed to the design of the Türi ski mountains , which were later not restored .
the newspaper Red Tblt wrote on 12 August 197 that the restoration of towns and settlements from the trees and their vehicles is progressing slowly , and the people could be involved in the corrogation .
in Turin , fertility crops were also severely affected , and the newspaper stated that &apos; party @-@ based organisations must be both an incentive and a guideline for corps and fertility &apos; .
Orkaanides can be said if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m / s .
in Estonia , 2 November 1969 , 2 November 1969 , when Ruhnul measured the wind at a speed of 48 m / s .
on the island of Vaindstory , a metre of measurements , so it was not possible to register the speed of a strong wind .
secret bathing areas : night cleaning and poor coastline
the more expensive summer weather also means less corrotation in the beaches of Tallinn .
&quot; if there is no , people are in the rank , and if there is no , there are no people , then the beer is saying .
in the Stroom of Northern Tallinn Stroom .
they are offered by a mechanical competition in the low @-@ turn tractor , which is a threshold for a placard to the trick .
in fact , the last seven cent goes through the depths of the sand , picking it out of sea litter and people left behind : pumps , cigarettes and others .
people are still coming to rank , regardless of whether water is sorely or not .
if there is a beauty , then people are in the rank , and if there is no , there are no people , &apos; says Alexander Usov , the head of the private company &apos; , the management of the Haabersti .
at 6.30 p.m. and rank , there is a bitter repetition of the work , because at 8 o &apos;clock , the poster must be in order for the people .
the Usov is already at four o &apos;clock .
apart from Stroom , he is still keeping an eye on the Pirita , Harku Lake , Kakumäe and Palaraare Pikakari .
the amounts of Prüm have fallen .
years ago , it was much more .
people will now be able to assess what is being done for them , &quot; says Usov , who has harvested 15 years .
before it was the case that , when something new had been put up , it was already the next day .
now , what is already being kept in the rank .
price of clean beach
one of the biggest jobs in Estonia &apos;s beaches is the breath of rubbish , or adru harvesting .
for example , there must be 400 000 tonnes of coastline in the Pirita coast .
&quot; this is unbelievable , &quot; notes the Usov .
the second major category is municipal waste , all of which people leave behind .
there are eight major rubbish seiners in Stroom &apos;s coast , which need to be watered down three times a week .
so much is the waste .
however , cold summer weather has meant that rubbish is a fifth less than otherwise .
the third species are abandoned .
in most cases , these are children &apos;s TV .
as a result , the Usov sand has pulled out ten metres of sludge .
they will remain waiting for the owners of timber to be landed .
&quot; they usually come out more , but it is a normal harvest . &quot; Usov is already aware that it will soon find them back in the sand .
children come to rank and take toys to reinstall them .
the landfill is broken down .
Erika Scholler , the representative of the administrative services , admitted that the work of the tractor is disrupting local communities .
noise , which runs from night to night hours , is confusing the people living in the neighbourhood .
on the day , however , this work is impossible .
in one month , we have two times to go through the war .
&quot; if we do not do this , the city will be fined , &quot; notes Scholler .
however , the aim is , like Pirita , Pikakr and Persian , to get Stroom rand under the quality of the international flag .
&quot; compared with Europe , there is much more work in Estonia to ensure that beaches are maintained , &quot; says Scholler .
we have more adru and more stone , and it is more difficult for us to live in the sand .
however , we have less rubbish than elsewhere in Europe .
when I hear that there is talk of rubbish in the rank , the conversations between the journalist and the corrogation staff living near Stroom are unwittingly , highlighting the current bottlenecks .
there is a picture of the moon everywhere in the gallery .
the problem is with birds and wood slaves who have pulled the rubbish bags &apos; , Martin .
although it is difficult to assume that people are able to change their behaviour so far , Martin hopes that the urban government will do something about the rubbish and , for example , put them on the roofs to prevent at least birds there from the news .
in general , however , Martin is satisfied with the development of Stroom .
it can be seen that the city is taking care of this .
it has become more pleasant with children &apos;s fields , enlightened and fresh asphalt .
it was never the case that there was only one way to travel on the ground , &quot; notes Mr Martin .
findings of the village in Stroomis : coins , only coins
a 40 @-@ year @-@ old Dimitr , who , as a arbiter , is sailing the coastline with a mechanical metal , has had to be exploited .
he does not believe that , today and in the future , nothing will be found in the price .
marine God is not generous enough to do so .
&quot; I have been dealing with this year and I have not found anything worthwhile so far , &quot; says Dmitry .
as a refrigeration , there are some euro coins in Dmitry , bottles and also dangerous pounds which later throw the rubbish .
normally , there are still coins .
&quot; culture , fingers and other things usually do not exist , &quot; it is the island &apos;s village .
Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain at the same level , as weak economic growth and inflation alleviation have softened speculation on the rise .
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth remains a loophole , as household incomes have put interest rates on expectations .
policy makers of the Bank &apos;s Financial Policy Committee ( MPC ) voted 6 : 2 to 0.25 % , and fewer members require an increase this month , as slow economic growth has weakened the support for growth .
in its quarterly report on inflation , the Bank will cut the forecast of 1.7 % in 2017 and 1.6 % in 2018 and warned that the pressure on households &apos; incomes would remain , as inflation is still expected to rise to 3 % in the autumn .
at the same time , the Bank also signalled that the increase in rates of inflation in the next few years is necessary to curb inflation from Brexon and the financial markets may be necessary for the expected increase in the cost of borrowing .
Members also voted in favour of the partial withdrawal of the mammoth package , which was launched a year ago as a result of Brexti .
in February , the Bank will put an end to the fixed @-@ term finance scheme , which will provide the banks with cheap funding , although it said that it is now up to GBP 15 billion under this scheme , which is GBP 115 billion .
in the minutes of the decision on the rate , the Bank says : &apos; the central forecast of the MPC will remain gross domestic product ( GDP ) in the near future , as the difficult situation of real income for households will continue to have an impact on consumption . &quot;
on the rates , it was repeated that there is a need for a &apos; fiscal policy &apos; to alleviate inflation , and this &apos; somewhat more &apos; , if the markets are expected .
Mr Böge is now predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020 .
however , the Bank stressed that any kind of leap is gradual and limited .
the Bank &apos;s reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
the forecast of 1.8 % growth in 2018 was maintained .
after this news , the pound fell against the dollar and the euro .
women fell by 0.5 % to USD 1.31 and 0.4 % to EUR 1.11 .
the decision not to make changes is due to the recent disappointing growth figures , which have led to growing hopes of an increase in GDP in the second quarter of the previous three months , from 0.2 % to 0.3 % .
the Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although at the end of the year it will be able to collect a little momentum .
the Bank &apos;s latest inflation report gave rise to little reason to rejoice for households suffering from rising inflation and abject wage increases , saying that the situation is going to get a little worse before an improvement .
it was added that the monetary policy cannot prevent income from the next few years , but the end of the three @-@ year forecast is expected to see a significant return to wages .
as a result , the economy will also be stimulated by increasing demand for British production , which will partly compensate for lower costs for consumers .
the decision comes one year after the rates were taken in August last year by 0.25 % after the shocking EU referendum , which led to a sudden weakening of the pound .
the Bank estimates that it is likely to take four years to completely breathe life into prices and the economy .
before the last decision of the Bank , there was a growing demand for raising the rate , as inflation has increased pressure on households ; in July , three policy makers called for an increase of 0.5 % .
inflation fell by 2.6 % last month , compared to 2.9 % in June , although the bank &apos;s message was expected to rise again in the coming months .
the Bank said that excessive growth compared to the 2 % target was caused by a completely weak pound .
Andrew Montlake , leader of Coreco mortgages , said : &apos; in view of the recent fall in exchange rates , it seems that the mortgage market will once again become more competitive , as borrowers are losing their jobs and hoping for a positive end to the year .
Mr Börs seems to be particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are coming to an end , as refinancing , often without service and low rates , has become increasingly popular . &quot;
NHS is writing 10 000 people out of conflict with HIV medicine
patients will have access to &apos; transformative &apos; HIV @-@ friendly treatment since September , following the battle against whether the NHS should finance the medicine .
the NHS England announced that public health is now estimated to make 10 000 people available for an initial three @-@ year clinical trial - pre @-@ pre @-@ professional sylactic ( PrEP ) - a tablet that is manned before the interim procedure and has shown a reduction in the risk of infection for high @-@ risk people by around 86 % .
the NHS agreed to finance a clinical attempt after the Court of appeal supported the decision of the Supreme Court last year , according to which the NHS is able to pay for the PrEP , despite its own claims that the medicine should be financed by local authorities .
Mr Stevens , the Executive Director of the NHS England , welcomed this Thursday as a &apos; new large @-@ scale intervention &apos; , while the National AIDS Fund ( NAT ) described it as a &apos; pivotal moment &apos; .
sexual health clinics in London , Bright ton , Manchester , Liverpoolis and Sheffield are among the first to register people , and in October , further clinics , before the programme is introduced in England by April 2018 .
exposure to pre @-@ emptive prophylactic ( PrEP ) is a hotline for HIV drugs , which will be taken before the interim arrangement to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
the results of clinical trials show that the PrEP will significantly reduce HIV transmission among people with the risk of infection .
the PrEP &apos;s adoption before the mid @-@ term review means that there is a sufficient number of medicines that prevent HIV infections .
such medicines can be taken every day or at the latest two hours before the interim procedure .
the appropriate candidates include gay or bisexual men , transgender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and do not receive treatment .
respondents identify suitable people who are willing to participate in clinical trials , including men , women , transgender people and those whose HIV @-@ related partner cannot receive antiretroviral treatment .
people who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will also be able to register their participation in the local sex health clinics in the programme .
the programme costs GBP 10 million and NHS England signed an agreement to obtain medicines this week after the international procurement procedure .
the clinical test aims to assess the actual potential of the PrEP by gathering clinical evidence of who is intended for treatment and how it is consumed and implemented .
Stevens said : &apos; this new wide @-@ ranging intervention should complement and leverage a wide @-@ ranging and increasingly successful fight against HIV .
this is another milestone for more than three decades in the fight against one of the greatest health problems of humanity . &quot;
Deborah gold , the Managing Director of NAT , said : &apos; this is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV .
the PrEP , if it is properly targeted at those who need it and belong to the risk chain , offers an opportunity to change the British HIV epidemic .
since September , people with a high risk of HIV in England have access to a powerful new tool that is individually managed and does not depend on the negotiations with a partner , thereby improving many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
the Managing Director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation , ian Green , said : &apos; now it is a priority to ensure that a clinical trial is put in place quickly and that none of the members of the HIV risk group should be excluded .
now that the PrEP clinical test has been obtained , we are on the way to protect more than 10 000 people who are at risk of being infected with HIV .
the Minister for Public Health , Sharon Hodgson , said : &apos; the beginning of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and very late after months of delay and the census of the government &apos;s shoes .
evidence shows how much changes can be brought to an end to HIV prevention and the spread of this life @-@ changing infection .
this clinical attempt will lead us a step closer to the full understanding of the advantages of the PrEP .
it is now important that a clinical trial be introduced as soon as possible in order to protect people who have contact with HIV , and to bring us a step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
the price of electricity rose by 12 % in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
the difference in electricity prices between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania fell to EUR 1.94 , compared to € 7.71 in June this year , announced by Elering .
the main cause of the price difference is the wealth of the Lithuanian @-@ Swedish Community .
in Estonia , EUR 34.33 per megatt @-@ hour and the price increased by 12 % compared to June last month .
in Latvia and Lithuania , the price fell by five per cent to EUR 36.27 per hour .
in Finland , the price of EUR 34.17 was EUR 34.17 , and the electricity exchanges in Nord half of the systemic price was EUR 26.37 per megawatt @-@ hour .
prices rose according to 12 and seven per cent .
between Estonia and Finland , electricity reached 75 % of last month &apos;s hours in Estonia and 16 % of the hours from Estonia to Finland .
the remaining nine % of the hours between two countries did not take place in the next day .
between Estonia and Latvia , electricity reached 99 % of the time from Estonia to Latvia and 73 % of the hours were used by the entire transmission capacity .
according to the last trading day of July , Nasdaq OMX on the market , in August , the price of electricity exchanges could be around 34 and € 37 per megavatt @-@ hour .
the price of carbon dioxide , which is affecting the price of electricity , came up last month , and transactions took place at 5.04 @-@ 5.47 per tonne .
life of higher education - half @-@ order and smart designers have made it a small Earls of the Court of Lords home
Joanne Leigh , a former banker who is a passionate property innovator , switched his home to the Grand Knightsbridge in 2014 against the Earls Court .
it is in Queen Anne Terţi &apos;s first order , and the fact that Joanne has not packed his bags and sold the flats , is a tribute to the new design .
&quot; before that , I lived together with a former fellow Member of life in Knightsbridge , &quot; said Joanne .
&quot; I chose something that would be tantamount to the price of my offer .
it was shown to me by the Earls Court and had the same high waves .
I have a doctor in this and I did the same day . &quot;
since the first visit , this 93 @-@ square metre has gone through full innovation .
at the beginning , it was one of the sleeping rooms and a complex star - to reach a sleeping in the kitchen , and Joanne wanted to add a storage space and a half order to take advantage of high rates .
&quot; I wanted high , big windows , a lot of light .
these were my demands , &apos; he said .
he is asking Erfan Azadi Notting Hillis for architectural and designer Duck &amp; D , to take advantage of 3.8 m ears and to create a home that is not just a development site , but a place where Joanne could live .
it was not high enough to add two space to each other , so the architectural challenge was to create a quasi @-@ order in which to stand up .
the Erfan was supposed to be a creative approach .
&quot; Metalldesign is quite complex , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to reorganise the premises so that they are located on each other , without having to be bogged down .
it was not just about building a platform , but we used the construction of steel , so that both the upper and lower space is right . &quot;
this place allowed the Erfanil to create two full @-@ blown elements in the room , with a great deal of dramatic elements .
a half @-@ way street will be opened up from the old @-@ old light of the Retrouvius window to the glacier of Retrouvius .
the Golden furniture , silver details and retrospective Serge Mouille , underscores space style .
the use of mirrors plays a role in the inclusion of theatre , space and lighting .
in the short corridor , mirrors have been added to both sides , so that it would seem longer .
in Knight , the mirror is giving the impression of a second @-@ tup window .
in the course of a return , the main savings for all Joanne &apos;s feed riches and glass requirements will be reflected .
housing is accompanied by a false opportunity to close the vegetables , if it is not used , creating a more dense space .
the cumbersome kitchen is nothing new .
however , with this kitchen , it is a unique fact that this is a type of uprising in the garage .
&quot; this went a little bit of design , &quot; explains the Erfan terasstrengthened MDF from the MDF .
&quot; this has a counterweight , which is why it is very simple to reject it . &quot;
thanks to the smart use of space and storage , Joanne now has 16 additional metres , an additional sleeping permit and a better corter plan .
&quot; after all , there is what you sell - or what gives real estate value , &apos; say Erfan .
&apos;Kinnisvarer takes an outdated form and makes calculations on the basis of the surface area &apos; .
here , they have been able to increase hospitality by using high @-@ quality materials , which add a luxury to the space .
&quot; materials are those that you are missing and thus help to create an emotional link with the home , &quot; says Erfan .
&quot; you do not love the electricity cable .
it is important , but it does not give heart to languages . &quot;
this shows that a good design and an increase in the area will help to make something amazing about the rather normal corps .
in fact , they may even create a desire not to leave , as was the case with Joanne .
the main figure , Jensen Chicago , is a petroleum in Chicago , who is competing with a colleague for his professionalism .
no other than the amount of money that has been earned , apart from which any ethics is forgotten .
his wife and three children see a man only in the early evening and late .
in the first half of the film , I think that it is a version of the business world - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler &apos;s speech is similar .
what the film is going on , however , in order to reduce the scaremongering element , and the moralising intention of film @-@ makers is becoming increasingly apparent .
life @-@ changing experience will be the main player in cancer .
there is now a choice between working and family life .
the pog of the ArchiteOffice makes a father think of the big buildings in Chicago &apos;s footsteps , about matters of real importance , such as religion , welfare , love ... , without even the disaster of the twin towers .
after the third , where the son &apos;s father opens the eyes , there is a feeling that the film @-@ makers will certainly be able to meet the objective of the audience , because even the most stubborn heart of the view is unable to keep the suffering of a doctor in the face of cancer .
if the son falls and his situation seems to be hopeless , the father will finally understand the morality of his work and will do a good job for the elderly .
now , in a sense , I am lucky with myself - if the film has been in possession of it , then I will reward my own sense after the film coffee , if I am wrong , then at least one surprises may be rewarded .
for a moment , there is a suspicion that the ice coffee will be lost - if the husband calls a sick and a man of a hospital in the middle of a corridor .
however , the Poeg has been amazing , and although his father has just lost his job , it will prove positive , because it is now time to deal with the family .
I can also feel well - I can predict the end of the American drama quite well !
in fact , the film is well constructed , all the elements that are necessary for this are there .
there can be a button , you can laugh , actor is good and moral beauty : money is not the most important thing in life .
this film is well @-@ established .
the new staff of the Trumpi will limit the President &apos;s media consumption .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly will be able to do so .
it would then be the first .
Politico writes that the new staffing of the White House intends to limit the flow of information from President Trumpin , including news , in the hope that it will keep the upper hand in the water .
here , the reporter Josh Dawseylt :
&quot; when the new staff of the White House , John F. Kelly , met with high officials on his first day of work , he pointed out a key problem with President Donald Trumpi Valges , which he intends to resolve in the hands of the President .
Mr Kelly said to the officials that the information must go through him , either on paper or at meetings , because the President would make better decisions if he was given good information . &quot;
Mr Kelly &apos;s diagnosis seems completely logical , but others have tried to do so and have failed to monitor his media consumption .
President Trumpi &apos;s relationship with television goes for decades , and now that he is in Valdis Main , his televisions have not gone anywhere .
&quot; when the candidate Trump was dishonest about the dishonest media coverage , he had to show him that he was also reflected fairly , &quot; said Sam Nunberg , a former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg , in February .
Politico tara Palmer wrote at the time that &apos; six former campaigners &apos; , according to Trumpi Twitter , the key to managing the habits of the Trumpi Twitter is to ensure that it has a personal media consumption in a stable way . &quot;
well .
however , the idea that the habits used by Trumpi Twitter have ever been &apos; controlled &apos; is ridiculous .
perhaps those campaigners know something that the rest of us do not know about the fact that the Trumpi bonuses would have been even more heartening without their intervention .
we will probably never be able to know about the shutdown that the Trump did not postal .
if he was able to save him or a couple of times , his efforts were worth doing so .
however , no one has been able to prevent Trumpi consistently from creating controversy .
part of the problem is that , in the White House , which consists of competing against each other , people are trying to promote their own interests without exception , by transferring material to the Olympic Games , which supports their views on the world , but may not always be credible .
Politico , which reflects the whole story , wrote in May the adviser &apos;s tendency to feed the President with a strategic question of information .
one of the examples described by the reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows :
&quot; the current and former Trumpi will say that Trump can respond to the negative press , particularly the harmful effects of information , explosive , taking an obsession with the identification of their source of origin .
this was also the case at the end of February , when someone gave a cheerful copy to the President of the Internet provocation to Charles C. Johnson &apos;s website , GotNews.com , which accused the staff deputies , Katie Walshi , that he was a white house for a number of leaflets .
there is no difference that Johnson has been permanently blocked by Twitter , or that he did not provide any specific evidence or that he has also made and withdrawn false accusations in the past .
Trump read the article and started to ask Walshi . &quot;
Goldmacher added that Rob Porter Reince Priebus and Head of the White House , Rob Porter , have tried to establish a system for managing and documenting the documents reaching Trumpin . &quot;
how did it succeed ?
Mr Kelly is trying to do exactly the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader , but the Trump is still an impulse and his helpless will continue to compete on the basis of influence .
these unchanging factors make the mission very difficult .
street musicians who have come from abroad to the capital of the capital will not be allowed to speak .
there is a lot of foreigners in the city centre of Tallinn .
those with whom the leaflet came out , acknowledged that they were playing in the old town without the permission of the urban government .
the first was the three street musicians who have taken the same cocktail with the gates of Viru .
it was clear to see that the musicians of the rubber and shackles were in absentia , who would have to spend one of the duch marches .
despite the fact , the only woman in the company played a pariah story , while one man , alongside him , was calling for a gesture of three faces and furniture closer to him .
the third man had sat alongside them on one hand and smoked a warm @-@ hearted farce .
their three chambers did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the people of the past .
Mr Bob , who has played the Acordion , has been saying that he has spoken in the streets , for the sake of both fun and money .
the aim of this group was to collect ticket money on the same day as a vessel travelling to Finland .
apart from the question of whether they asked for permission from the town of the age of the exhibition , Noemi and Bob were shaking their heads .
firstly , we did not know .
secondly , we will never stay in one city more than a day or a few and , in most cases , permits for a month or something like this .
it makes no sense to pay for this , &quot; explained by Bob .
when we returned to the gates of Viru about 20 minutes later , we saw that two women are in musicians and are going to go .
it is a task of luck to the Viru Centre in absentia and cocktails .
three Polish young men , one of whom played a fifth , are also present on the streets of Viru Viru , and the third was even in the form of electronic glass .
&quot; we are here to offer people entertainment in order to spread music and joy , and to earn money for fuel and living , &quot; explained the trio from Mivosh .
according to Mivoshi , they are aware that there must be permission from the city government to take place .
&quot; of course we do not have it , &quot; he said it joke .
but we hope that if people enjoy our music , there is no problem .
of course , if the police comes , we will go elsewhere , but we must try , he added .
in July , the Estonian bank purchased bonds worth € 149 million in the public sector of central banks in the euro area , a bank bond portfolio increased to € 4.36 billion .
the Central Bank does not publish more detailed information on purchases .
the President of the Bank of Estonia , Hardo Hansson , has explained in the past that the assets of the central banks of the euro system are covered by three different purchasing programmes : the bonds of the financial sector covered by the financial sector ( VIS ) , property guaranteed bonds ( ABS ) and public bonds ( PSPP ) .
the Central Bank is buying bonds from the market to encourage investors to invest money elsewhere .
the impact of purchases will fall in the production of lower @-@ risk assets and will motivate investors to take greater risks .
in general , in the framework of the public bond programme , each central bank will buy its government bonds , with other countries &apos; bonds not being purchased .
as the Estonian state has not issued bonds , the Estonian bank will make so @-@ called &apos; replacement shopping &apos; within the limits of the amount allocated to them .
the central banks also shop in those countries where the supply of bonds corresponding to the purchase scheme is limited .
the Estonian bank is generally buying bonds from the European institutions , such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank bonds .
the Estonian bank is buying bonds under the asset programme from March 2015 .
in the meantime , Election bonds were also purchased , but the Estonian Bank of June 2016 will no longer buy bonds from June 2016 .
on behalf of the central banks of the euro area , since June , both the Central Bank and Estonia are buying energy bonds from Finland .
migrants ignore degrees and return to &apos; millions of business &apos; .
some of the richest owners of the West Midlands have once again found themselves in a fierce confrontation with determined migrants who have ignored the cradle of the Council to win back their cotton .
migrants have parked their 20 trailers near the streets of Solihull , who are risked by a wealth of millions of business .
they have returned , together with the horses , children and lorries , after they were thrown out of it only in May , without allowing themselves to be confused with the bureaucracies of the Council to prevent their invasion .
the group found a weak place in defence limits , turning its vehicles through unblocked parts that were left to pocket .
the people of Maruangry have surrendered the Solihull Council , saying that the Council is &apos; useless &apos; in dealing with the problem .
one anonymous resident said : &apos; they are sitting there on Monday evening after their exclusion from Bentley Heathfrom , where they were stoned by stoning .
the Council must be ashamed that they are going to act , because they are useless in dealing with the problem .
the migrants were there in May , they were going to go and now they are back again .
they came to the last night , probably more today . &quot;
he added : &apos; Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such things by obtaining long barriers to protect their parks .
I live on the road to strike , and I am not satisfied that I must continue to pay the power of a total tax if the Council is unable even to prevent such a thing . &quot;
one local resident , who also wanted to remain anonymous , said : &apos; it is ridiculous , and we saw the last of these migratory movements , and there is already a new offensive .
this time , there has been an increase in the number and even a horse has been seen in the grassland . &quot;
the representative of the Solihull Council said : &apos; we are aware that there is an unacceptable camp in the land near the street pasbrook , and we are working with the Solihulli police , and we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible .
the gathering of evidence is very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police , calling the number 101 .
this will help to create a picture of the situation for the Court if we present the case to them . &quot;
the Weekna festival will also visit the Minister for Culture , Indrek Saar , who is pleased that Estonia has been able to bring real world top names .
on the question of why the Weekise festival is so important for the Estonians , Saar says that it should be asked from all those who enjoy the Festival &apos;s three days in full .
however , he is saying that the real players have come to the skies .
&quot; looking at the level of artists that have been able to be brought to Estonia , the absolute top names of this musical gesture - often not in our hands - are spoken by the Minister for Culture .
however , what are the artists at the festival of Saart who are most telling themselves ?
I consider myself to be a relatively old person , and I am sure one of the most experienced doctors , Armin van Bnewren , who stood up yesterday evening .
after all , it is all of us who , at some point , have complicated their own feet , &apos; he says &apos; .
however , it is still highlighting a number of names , such as Chainthia , Deadmau5 , Knifea .
of course , our own Estonian players : starting with NOx P and they can be read a whole series .
in reality , this well @-@ known concentration of names is very high , he says .

Audi upgrades up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the middle of the criticism of car manufacturers
the day before the Audi announcement , BMW said that it provides an software app for more than 350 000 vehicles .
according to the Chairman of BMW , the company believes that &apos; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions &apos; , referring to European cities , including BMW , in Munich , which has considered a ban or restriction on diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe will be upgraded to reduce gas emissions from diesel engines .
no company has described these procedures as a re @-@ call .
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and in the United States in order to help comply with the regulations on carbon dioxide emissions .
however , nitrogen oxide from diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and could cause asthma .
at the same time , the cost of equipment to neutralise emissions from diesel vehicles is increasing for car industry , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
while German car manufacturers are under thorough investigation , Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s government is also accused of ringing the powerful car manufacturers and ignoring the signs referring to the problem .
companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen , who are silent on the use of so @-@ called petrolery devices , which enabled the testing of gas to be adapted to the regulations in the time of testing a car , but returned to normal driving conditions .
several Volkswagen leaders have been prosecuted in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former president of the Audi engine Development unit was arrested in Germany .
former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and can be brought to justice in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , the Audi German Volkswagen was drawn into criminal investigations when the authorities accused the installation of the audit system in order to evade the requirements of the European emissions of gas , thereby extending the investigation , which was previously focused on the United States .
the inclusion of the Audi in the investigation may be a major blow to the Volkswagen , the manufacturer of luxury cars , which is a disproportionately large part of Volkswagen &apos;s profits .
Estonia &apos;s schools will have 20 000 euro of EU flags .
the Ministry of Education intends to buy the flags of the European Union to the Estonian schools by 1 September .
a total of 105x158 per cent of the European Union &apos;s flag will be 570 educational institutions .
flags are intended to be made in indoor rooms , they have to be carried out in high @-@ quality printed techniques , with a view to a certificate of convenience , brokering the ERR news portal .
there is a text on the label : &apos; Kingitus Estonia &apos;s schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union .
the estimated cost of 570 flags is EUR 20 000 at the Ministry of Education , or one flag costs EUR 35 .
murder of journalist highlights growing threat in Mexico
the workers of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually gather on Wednesday , to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the State of Yaloa , which is sown by organised crime , corrupt officials and ceased drug wars .
however , today they have gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their own security .
they are told that it is important to change their routine .
two parents will be discussing which seems safer : either to bring children into office , which was the target of a grandioattack in 2009 , or to leave them home .
security experts have written three words to the leader of the room : &apos; enemies &apos; , &apos; neutrality &apos; , &apos; allies &apos; .
they are asking reporters to be able to provide the names of a veil in every case , there is no need for impressions and internal emotions .
the presence of the government or cartels is suspected of drug traffickers , politicians , businessmen and journalists , a whole list of couples who make it dangerous to reflect the chaos in Mexico .
there is no breath of violence , and the more the bodies of the country accumulate , the majority of them are journalists , according to the Committee on the Protection of journalists , from the appointment of President Enrique Pena Montreto in December 2012 , at least 25 . 589 journalists , following attacks and threats under national protection , have so far been killed at least seven journalists in the seven states .
the latest deaths include their editor and source of inspiration , Riodoce co @-@ founder Javier Valdez Cardenas .
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; wrote in Valdez one of his many books on drug violence .
his absence is deeply felt , even though his presence can be felt everywhere on a façade of a secular Riodoce building , a big picture of the average of Valdezz , with a letter of &apos; Justice &apos; , and two of the 30 reports , Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez , is carrying T @-@ shirts , which have been portrayed by his wife , or the amateur face of glasses .
the meeting will take place less than two months after his death ; Reporters will be discussing a common trauma , their nightmare , dreams , paranoia .
although in 2010 , a separate public Prosecutor &apos;s office was set up to address cases of journalists , only two cases have been prosecuted by the Committee on the Protection of journalists .
as in the case of the most annual drug trafficking and organised crime , the number of murders of thousands , the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .
the editorial of Riodoce will continue to reflect the violence in the Sinalas , although their hearts have been broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous .
without the data and justice of murderers , there is no great benefit from the meeting on security , according to Ibarra .
&quot; it is very nice to waste your time here at the meeting , &apos; he says .
&quot; as long as the reason is not known , you will have no confidence in all . &quot;
Valdez left in the capital of the State , Culiacan , the Riodoce office , on 15 May morning .
he managed to travel only a few quarters before the two men stopped the red Toyota Coroles , and he was forced to go out of the car and shot at 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which means the &apos; twelfth river &apos; .
the armed man travelled to Valdez &apos;s car and made an accident in the vicinity .
Valdez was 50 years old .
she was left behind by a woman and two adults .
the Culiacan is spreading freely in Culiacan .
however , there is basically only silence on the subject of Valdez .
since the arrest of Guzman last year and the extradition of the United States in January , you have been one of the most bloody battlefields in the country , because rivalries are fighting to fill the power vacuum .
there is no difference that a person or even a number of people are being shot on the streets of oa every day , or that the dead are stunned by the double @-@ fashioned sweets of drugs , which are greater than many homes .
let us forget for a moment that the time of peace refers to the fact that only one cartel is headed by the state of the sea with valuable ports and drugs routes to the United States .
despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers of his work , Riodoce co @-@ founder and the President , IsMay Bojorquez ( 60 ) , feels that he was unable to defend his friend .
he believes that the killing was facilitated by two mistakes .
the first of these was the publication of an interview with Guzman &apos;s sons with a competing and military cartel , Damaso Lopezevery , in February .
this piece of correspondence could have been alluded to by the suspect gangs who bought all the copies of the publication as soon as they were reached in the newspapers .
the second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own security , after there was a ramp in one of the newspapers that have been reflected in the same story .
Valdez was legalised both in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico .
he had remained alive for so long that his friends and colleagues expected him to be permanently present .
he worked in 2003 as a veteranreporter in Noroeste , when he joined the five colleagues in order to create Riodoce , selling 50 @-@ dollar shares .
Bojorquez said that &apos; it was impossible to deal with the press without touching the drug problem &apos; .
the amount of time has been felt by its courageous and honest performances and sales and advertising increased .
Reporters were keen to express vigorous studies without fear of censorship and readers , which they were able to read stories that no one else dared to reflect .
eight years after the establishment of Riodoce , the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for his Latin American reports .
in the same year , the Committee on the Protection of journalists in Valdez ( AKK ) won the International Press Freedom Prize for his courage to follow the Mexican drug story wherever it leads .
he openly admitted that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to live on , &quot; he said the AKK award .
last October , in an interview with Rompeviento TV , he said that drug trafficking is a way of life in the Yaloas .
&quot; your head is to embrace the task that the journalists &apos; office will have a second chance to play .
I do not want to ask me what I did in the face of so many deaths , or why I did not say what is happening . &quot;
Riodoce collectives will miss Valdez , a joke , a rob like low , a friend who divided embryos and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they gave their support to his routine .
he always gave his village a barrel .
he went from the office of El nan to the bar of El Salvador , and was always sitting on the same table .
now they are asking whether his stupid love was fatal to him .
his death has also put them into question how best to do their work and stay in life .
&quot; they do not like their women , their children , their legitimate business , their secret landing cards used to transport drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things should not have been touched , &quot; said Bojorquez .
the result is , even in the best times , strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ censorship .
trust in your instincts .
if it is a matter of dubious fragrances , it is a matter of keeping away .
according to the editor of Riodoce , Andres Villarreali , the problem is that &apos; fragrance can be deceived ... and so this is the case with Jternity &apos; .
he and others say that you no longer have the old rules , just as they do not apply in Thailand , Veracruz , Guerreros or other states which are home to the toxic combination of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt state officials .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in a space where the Riodoce workers met for security training , mobile phones were suddenly no longer permitted ; some days before that , it was revealed that only the numbering assets sold to governments had been used in Mexico to monitor journalists and activists .
in front of the House , two police officers sought to alleviate the 40 @-@ degree heat of the puzzle .
the government appointed them to a more elected Riodoce office in the Culiacan Centre in the Culiacan Centre .
some reporters wondered whether these police officers are among their 50 % of police officers , whose Governor himself has been unreliable .
several months have passed since the reporters have travelled to mountain areas where control is de facto in the hands of drug gangs .
Riodoce &apos;s edition of this week addressed three main features .
one of them was the murder of the former poet Julio Cesar Chavez venna in Sinaloas .
in addition , they had a revealing story of the spending of government funds on the home town of the Governor .
a group of people was kidnapped by Culiacan , one of the most expensive restaurants , from the Culiacan cabinet to the quarter .
there was no official announcement of who was kidnapped or how it happened , so it was necessary to be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city of the restaurant , both the drug traffickers and the authorities of the authorities .
the Reporter became aware of the public documents that the restaurant is registered as a politician who belongs to the institution in power , the Revolutionary Party ( IRP ) , which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the last century .
in recent times , several IRP Governor has been accused of corruption in the framework of cases of corruption .
in Villarline asked the reporter to write previous incidents in the same place , including how the son of Guzman , El Chapo , who was wearing the name of &apos; El Chapo &apos; .
just a few months earlier , readers would have been looking for a Valdez cocktag to obtain information on the kidnappings from the best sources .
&apos;In the past we would have known what happened , &apos; said 46 @-@ year @-@ old Villark , whose body construction has earned him a slogan El Flaco .
&quot; now all channels of communication have broken down with our sources . &quot;
the Valdez office has become a reservoir to bridges and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists , and editorial workers have become something that they never expected to wait for activists on behalf of the press .
Reporter Miriam Ramirez seized a few eyes and direction next morning to the local Prosecutor &apos;s office for another journalist .
Mr Salvador , in the West of Michoacan State , three days after the murder of Valdez .
it has been found to be a dead body and , according to officials , it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests .
journalists have become more popular across the country , and are crippling organised protests on the roads and buildings with the phrase &apos; SOS press &apos; .
on this day , President Bojorquez is in Washington trying to collect international support for justice in the Valdez case .
a day after the death of Valdez , the Ramirez authorities accused the authorities of the journalists , in a numbering and killing them , of telling the truth .
after that , he asked him to be diverted from the government &apos;s activities elsewhere , concerned that hatred has been affected by objectivity .
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists have been &apos; restricted &apos; by organised crime , co @-@ culprits and indifferent society . &quot;
in his last book , &apos; drug media &apos; , he wrote that the reporters are not only killing drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who are at the mercy of organised crime .
Articulo 19 , the Media Monitoring Group , appealed to more than half of the attacks on journalists on the police and civil servants last year .
&apos;In Mexico &apos; , because you want to be silent , &apos; said Ramirez .
there is obviously a verbal impact .
no one will forget the death of bloggers and Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state in Thailand six years ago .
he was found to be dead with a letter , which was probably signed by a cartel in LOS Zetas : &apos; I am here for my reports &apos; .
in addition to his painted head , computer glass and ears were found .
some publications have decided to close their doors , such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state , Chihuahuahua , following the killing of their correspondent in March of the Monslava Blush .
others will pass on as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo after the murder of their President in 2004 .
in 2010 , the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez has publicly spoken to the drug cartel with the slogan &apos; What do you want of us ? &apos; .
some journalists have fled from national states or even from the country .
this is a nervous decision .
it is difficult to find a job in exile and they still have to look at the streets in order to avoid dangers .
and sometimes they are behind them , as was probably the case with the photograph Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered together with four women &apos;s people in 2015 , three months after the Veracruzist break .
those who remain in place and continue to work will have to refute risky decisions every day .
Ibarra , who once wanted to become a poet , recognises that the reporting of drug trafficking is frightening him .
&quot; Mexico is on the road to hell , and that is why I am going to report , &quot; he said .
one of the recent midnight of Friday , when the latest number had already been stunned , the editors of Riodoce sat in front of the office and plundering the beer when suddenly all the phones began to be calibrated .
there were 19 people who died in the fire exchanges between rival gangs and the security forces in Mazatlanis , a staggering 19 people .
the war continues to continue , as has been promised by several of the messages of cartels that have been found in the region .
on the basis of the same pavements , reporters made news on the Riodoce website using a mobile phone .
in the front of next day , we needed to change .
the Sireens were seized by another arms exchange in the region .
Bojorquez piilus on white police officers to see whether they are vigilant .
if they were afraid , they did not at least show that .
the founder of the newspaper has fallen under the mass tree , which his average fingers are to see the whole of the blue , editorial by Riodoce workers in his footsteps .
&apos;How can you think about closing , &apos; said Bojorquez , &apos; whereas on the same day when Javier was killed , a traineeship asked me to make a report on the streets ? &apos;
Dinosaurus used protective colours to prevent enemies
at first sight , it seems like a form , although rather frightening .
scientists have now unveiled the first findings in relation to the unbelievable presence of the Canadian mine , which is so well preserved that the experts have described it as &apos; dinosaurs Mona &apos; .
it has been so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that the leak covered by his soya was the colour of red bogus and his past had been somewhat &apos; complicated &apos; .
the report published in the Biology published in the press described the assumption as &apos; the best preserved sodium &apos; , which has ever been found &apos; and &apos; one of the best parts of the world &apos; .
in the case of fossil fuels , it is a new type of nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the age of 110 @-@ 112 million years ago .
it is incredibly good to maintain it in Rabat , who describe it as &apos; truly remarkable &apos; .
according to the National GeoGuard , this type of phosphorus , which has ever been found , has been best covered by this type of phosphorus .
it was found on 21 March 2011 by Shawn functional , when he extracted Suncor Millenium in the Fort McMurray near Northern Albertas in Canada .
he has struck something that did not remind the surrounding stone , and decided to examine more closely .
the phosphorus identified was sent to Royal Tyrrell Paleontology museum .
for the next six years , it was designed to refer the animal to 2 500 pounds ( 1100 @-@ kilometres ) .
after all this hard work , the final result is now finally ready to bring the public to the public .
&quot; if a little bit of eyes , it can almost be believed that he sleep , &apos; said Caleb Brown , the leading author , Royal Tyrrell , in the museum of the Royal Tyrrell .
&quot; this will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and most preserved dinosaurs - Mona Lisana . &quot;
when he looked at the leather , he found that this vegetation , which is covered by sows and resembles a walking tank , was likely to pose a significant threat to meat @-@ food dinosaurs .
this high @-@ level dinosaur used the red and white defence colours in order to hide from predators , and applied sheltering techniques which are called &apos; shelter &apos; and which are also used by many modern animals .
this enabled experts to be better integrated into the dinosaur and to avoid enemies , as the major dinosaurs were likely to be hunted to him .
this was the first time in the news in May and is now visited by Royal Tyrrell in the paleontology museum of the Royal Tyrrell .
researchers have now investigated and given it the name of the Borealopelta Marmitchell museum , mark Mitchell , who was a famous team that spent more than 7 000 hours of demand to reveal more than 7000 hours .
thanks to the amazing good preservation of the father , Dr Mitchell and the team of international scientists were able to document the shape and size of the sows .
they discovered a contradiction - a common method of protection in the country of animal origin , which means that the intrusion of the present was a dark than the aluminium .
although there is a common sense of responsibility , the findings come as a surprise , as Boeing is much greater than those who are living in the face of the shadows today .
this suggests that the dinosaur is being actively hunted out by other musicians , so that the evolution preferred to be overshadowed instead of the confrontation of the survivors .
however , most of the animals used today , such as fear , bars or archaecles , are much smaller and more vulnerable , indicating that nodosaurus had to really work to survive .
&quot; the strong hunt of the dinosaur , which is covered by a huge and abundant amount of soya , shows how dangerous it could be to be the animals who were kidnapped in the age of crippers , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds of organic compounds also revealed that the leather of the dinosaur was a red bag .
scientists will continue to set up an investigation in order to get angles about this life , including the retained content of this gender @-@ style , in order to find out what the animal is the last word .
they believe that the dinosaur collapsed in the dead rivers , thereby entering into the sea , where he was sunk in the ocean .
at that time , Albertas was just as warm as it is currently in South Florence , and rivers and oceans are likely to go far beyond the internal land .
&quot; this nodosaurus is truly remarkable , as it is fully covered by a sober leaf , while it has also remained three @-@ dimensional , maintaining the original form , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; as a result , the animal today sees almost the same as in the age of cricket .
in order to reconstruct it , there is not a great deal of imagination to use - it is enough simply to preach bridges and it seems that he would be sleeping . &quot;
the time of the crisis was the time when there were huge two legs on the ground , the dinosaurs - heterohants .
although the Queen Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than Borealopelta , it could have been stunned by some of his horrendous predecessors .
these include Acrocanthosaurus , 38 legs ( 11.5 metres ) , a long and six @-@ tonne monster .
scientists , whose recent findings are published in the magazine Biology , believe that Borealopelta was killed after death in the sea and this muzambique sludge .
on 21 March 2011 , Shawn functional was discovered when he extracted Fort McMurray near the mining of Millenium in Northern Albertas in Canada .
according to the Muuseum , it is best preserved in the world , including leather and soya , and it is a comprehensive concentration up to timber .
these assumptions were on average 18 legs ( five metres ) long and the shelves up to GBP 3 000 ( 1300 kg ) .
two 20 customs @-@ long ora emerged from its shoulders .
scientists believe that it was covered by the current Western Canada , until the river flooded into the open sea .
however , the place in which the dinosaur was burnt helped to maintain its excellent speciality in detail .
the ice caps of this particular father are so well preserved that the headlines of the mysterious soomers are still covered by the headlines of the dinosaur .
as Michael Greshko wrote in the magazine National Geodic : &apos; such storage is just as rare as a loophole .
the more I look at it , the more incredible it seems .
Deleaded skin ice is still covered by the creation of mysterious soya beans on the ground .
a better front is lying alongside him , and five of the assets have been rushed upwards .
I will be able to count on the sows in his winter . &quot;
how did one activist find a response to the question of &apos; whose thanks ? &apos;
on 9 August 2014 , Brittany Ferrell received a full shock .
just a day after the trip to New York , it was the case of St. Louise Airbnb , who had been rented in New York , on a phone on Facebook .
he came to the post of his former school commute .
there was a letter : &apos; the police killed just 18 @-@ year @-@ old adolescents and he is still on the streets &apos; .
he was confused why no one else had posted this information on his stream , which is why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
Pidega @ TheePsucah &apos;s user was repeatedly divided on his timeline .
Mr St. , from the Louise region , Michael Browni , the death of an unarmed 18 @-@ year @-@ old black man , who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson Missouris , was communicated in real time .
he gave a picture of the life of Brown , which was in the street , for four hours .
&quot; it is crazy , &quot; said Ferreira .
however , death was nothing new for him or for the community .
he has put his phone off , but later this evening , he saw a refinement , which said this time about the people of Canfield Drive Drive .
Jagati photographs of the police and the harsh people , and a man who claimed himself to be the father of Browni and kept the label &apos; Fergusoni police killed just my unarmed son &apos; .
he watched in real time a stream in which the police officer stood before a group of protesters with the graves .
in the second video , another police officer , he said , &apos; I kill you all ... animals &apos; .
Mr Ferrell is reminded of how he struck himself : &apos; it is unusual . &apos;
&quot; this is not a murder of this kind , which we are accustomed to and what we could describe as typical . &quot;
I felt frightened at this moment .
I was angry and I met . &quot;
he booked a return flight and travelled home on the next day .
at 23 o &apos;clock , he went to his father for his six @-@ year daughter and decided that they would travel to a two @-@ year @-@ old Ferguson next morning .
what the Ferrell and Fergusonga took place in the next three years is a central issue in the new documentary &apos; Whose street &apos; , &apos; whose streets ? &apos; , which will be presented in cinemas on 11 August .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resilience from the point of view of those who live in this community and who have thanked the answers .
when Mrs Ferreira , together with her daughter - who had a lipsy sticker and a peculiar chat with it - Ferguson , they spoke again on a subject that they had repeatedly spoken before this morning - about the experience and living conditions of the musicians .
&quot; remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights ? &apos; recalls itself in question .
&quot; we are now travelling to Fergusoni , because the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old boys and that is not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take him on board , &quot; said Ferreira later .
&quot; what is happening now is the culmination of what happened in the past .
it must be aware of this and see it growing in the middle .
he must learn about the activist and organisation of the activist and , at the same time , feel the different layers of experience and living conditions , and what we need to do in order to be free and free .
even if I succeed in bringing him up so that he does not personally copy brutal racism , he does not differ from some other black girls .
I feel that I would do him a disservice if I would defend him for this world . &quot;
the first stop that they did in the vicinity of the Fergusoni was through South Florissanti - the police station in the middle of the road , which had become a certain kind of camp , where activists were waiting for news about the police officer , Darren Wilson , who was not ultimately charged .
there , Mrs Ferreira , and his daughter , joined forces with local business owners who prepared lunch .
they put together food bags and helped to distribute them to the protesters .
for the Ferrell , a new type of activist has slowly started to take shape .
&quot; my activist change completely after 9 August , &quot; he said , saying that when he was a student at the Missouri @-@ St. Louise University , he was the President of the Union for Young students and focused on food justice and health inequalities in Muslim communities .
&quot; I did not have any experience of organisation .
this is all simply a pipe . &quot;
weeks later , Ferreira met a film co @-@ director Sabaah Folayanevery .
the Folayan said that he and the film operator , Mr Alvarado @-@ Farrar , simply wanted to document what is happening .
the question of the Ferrell came to light : &apos; are you trying to document what is happening or to find a story that can be used ? &apos;
such scepticism was due to countless cases where people - often painful - come to the community and try to benefit from its legitimacy and resilience .
the Folayan explained in a recent interview : &apos; we had heard that the voice of the people born in Ferguson would not be heard and we wanted to do so differently . &apos;
the Folayan Damon Davati , the co @-@ director of the region , who was well known for prisoners sentenced to death , had already been hit by the Folayan .
his involvement made the project attractive to the Ferrell and the six other local ones who were watched by the film &apos; Whose street &apos; for years after the shooting of Browni .
&quot; in this documentary , nobody is talking about us or with us , but we are talking about ourselves , &apos; said Davis .
&quot; for me , it was important how these people are portrayed , because I am also portrayed . &quot;
although the aim was not to focus on the experience of Ferrell - it was intended to show that the movement is not a &apos; donor leader &apos; , but a community of community &apos; , as the Folayan said , it was the most open party to the film .
as a result , the &apos; Whose street &apos; is documented by the surprising personal aspects of the life of Ferrell , such as ruthless and married with his wife .
&quot; I felt , as I would be earlier , &apos; said Ferreira , laughing at the first time when he was prepared to see the city .
&quot; however , I realised that this work and the humanity of the black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability . &quot;
moreover , the Ferrelli story emphasises and replaces the role of black LGBT women in the wider Black Sea Lives Matter movement .
two of the three initiators of the movement , who thought in the social media in 2012 after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martini , the hashtag # BlackLivesMatter , is homosexual .
&quot; the leading role of homosexual women has kept the movement in general , &quot; said Ferreira , &quot; and this is precisely because we have to fight continually on several fronts .
Roma women have to bear all the burden . &quot;
the Folayan agreed , pointing out that &apos; movement is indeed alive by black women , and many of them are black homosexuals &apos; .
at the same time , he says that &apos; this is not a kind of kind of equal opportunities &apos; - Ferrelli was not chosen as a central point for his identity .
&quot; he was someone who was the right energy , &quot; he said .
&quot; however , it is not a coincidence that he was directly located on the front line , because the black LGBT woman is at stake when living in such hubs .
his energy can be perceived through the screen . &quot;
at the same time , the news cameras Fergusonist has long disappeared , but racial links between the community and the police are still fragile .
at the time of the demonstrations in the Ferrell , the conditional sentence for blocking the road lasts for another 2.5 years .
he describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere in the region , which he calls on home , simply as a &apos; huge threat &apos; .
nevertheless , it still attaches importance to the mantra that has been fed by the memory of the memory since it was on the streets of Ferguson a whole three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love each other and support each other .
we do not have to lose anything apart from our chains . &quot;
7 nips , how to overcome the Weekise du pohmelle
some of the most stubborn meters will find that , after a scarce number of pipes , they will be able to help .
or in the light of the word &apos; Beet pot &apos; , the pyramid of the stick &apos; .
however , this is only an inevitable postponement and a good blessing for health .
what can you do to make sure that , after today and tomorrow , the Weekise trend - or other pipes - is better felt this morning and to overcome the poppy as painfully as possible ?
Joo water .
it is down to alcohol and , after a great deal this morning ... or , if possible , even alcohol .
as the body loses a lot of liquids when it comes to alcohol consumption , it must somehow be recovered .
together with water , mineral materials and sestap are also a good hair of mineral water .
as it is often irritated after a meal , it is particularly good if it is a bubble @-@ free or easy gamble .
let us walk .
it would certainly not cost the grandmother to burn the trees - it may prove fatal to be a false decision .
however , it is easy to remind the body once again what the feeling is in life .
Telgis and sleeping boys are a more time @-@ consuming way of sleeping .
give poor energy back slowly and cautiously .
if you are already in the middle of yesterday &apos;s overrun , it will certainly not be worth trying to charge a heavy fat .
for example , a fresh volume of fruit in which the lion &apos;s body is slowly placed on the market .
if the health of the South is already suffering , it would be possible to try , for example , powdered .
and a little later .
a coffee was avoided .
this softer will release your body from the last water .
as has already been said : water and volume are friends .
the contribution to analgesics .
if you were to be painkiller in order to prevent the pot , then you have to deal with paratsetamol or ibuprophet , not only with alcohol , but also with the ability to do so .
so the riches are even more expensive , and in the future , the poppy is worse .
in addition , there will not be a long @-@ term silence in the past .
if you take a painkiller this morning , you will do it with a blank cheque - it irritates your already dirty mails .
or if a partner is not to be taken , it will be well with itself .
it is about the same thing as walking , but it does not become a orgasm .
however , there should be too active a gear and an outrageous shop - a physical effort should be moderated during the pot .
a joke .
the words of the friends of the friends of the friends of the time , the easy topes and the naera amicably , both for themselves and for others ( suffering ) .
Nali and laugher may not be doing a pot , but it is certainly easier for them to follow up .
once again , the pohmell goes on anyway !
Professor of Northwestern and Oxford University workers are being sought as suspects in murder
according to the police , the professor of the University of Northwestern and the University of Oxford , who have received suspects after death row , are being sought by the police , from a university in Chicago to the death of male people .
according to the trial of the Cook County , on Monday , the arrest warrant was issued for 42 @-@ year @-@ old Wyndham Lathemi and 56 @-@ year @-@ old Andrew Warreni , accused of the death of Trenton H. James Cornell @-@ Duranleu for their alleged association .
according to documents , 26 @-@ year @-@ old Cornell @-@ Duranleu died after repeated Nazis .
according to a warning , the Chicago police station issued to the community , the body of the 27 July was discovered .
police officers received a telephone call and found the Grand Plaza Corterhouse for the victim , whose body had a number of storms .
according to the officials , the Cornell @-@ Durantagu event was recognised as dead and investigators , while the police are actively looking for two suspects .
it has worked as co @-@ professors of microbiology and immunology at the University of Northwester since 2007 .
the Vice @-@ President of the University of Public Relations , Alan K. Cubbage , said in a statement sent as an e @-@ publishing , that Lake has now been temporarily removed from work and has been banned from entering the cities of the University of Northwester .
&quot; this is now a criminal investigation by the competent authorities , and the University of Northwester will work with researchers , &quot; said Cubbage .
Mr Warren is a senior assistant in the University of Oxford .
the representative of the University and Somerville College said : &apos; we have been in contact with the British police and ready to help US research authorities in every way possible &apos; .
in addition , the statement stated that Warreni &apos;s colleagues are shocked and willing to give themselves .
Anthony Guglielm , President of the Chicago police department , urges the authorities to give themselves to the authorities .
&quot; the police have an idea where they are , but we are dealing with an increasingly intensive definition of the exact location , &quot; said Guglielm .
according to Guglielm , suspects will help local , regional and national authorities .
the Guglielm said that the police had received a telephone call from the Grand Plaza Corterhouse , who had just received a cryptic rain that there has been something happening at Corps .
according to the police description , it was a magic spectacle .
according to Guglielm , it is not clear whether the event was also taking place on 27 July .
he said that the security cameras confirm the presence of Lathemi and Warreni in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor Lathamil and the victim had a relationship , &quot; added Guglielm .
the Grand Plaza leadership sent a letter to the people : &apos; the police are currently working to identify the background of events and the background of the victim , and examines the various motives , including the possibility of a family dispute . &quot;
companies that help your businesses to avoid receiving the next Ubwould
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of workers in his e @-@ commerce start @-@ ups , but the polls were lucrative .
the answers were often vague , useless or , even worse , misleading .
and even if he promised to ensure anonymity , some workers did not trust this process .
&quot; this system was simply not consistent and objective , &quot; said Errett , who is headed by Madison Reed , a company operating in San Franciscos , who sells 75 workers .
it therefore called on external actors to help .
start @-@ ups with new types of human resources , which will help businesses to find out what their workers feel .
by developing and licensing software , which aims to measure the involvement of workers , they will allow companies to make a knife , to target firm teams and demographic groups , to provide the anonymity and complaints of the workers , and , in some cases , to allow manufacturers to bypass C @-@ level leaders and to turn directly to the Bureau .
&quot; now there are tools such as Strava and Fitbi , which are designed to monitor health , but where is Fitbi for your company ? &apos; asked Jim Barnett , co @-@ founder and CEO Reding wood City start @-@ ups Glint , whose software analysts are used by companies to measure the involvement of workers .
according to Erretti , he has received three years when he has used Glinti , a much better overview of what he thinks and feel .
in addition to surveys and specific teams , it offers a company &apos;s heat card , which gives an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest support , allowing it to identify the causes .
companies have started to understand that they have to stay in touch with their culture of work , so as not to become the next Ub , which has been insurmounted in scandals since the former worker published a blog , which described the harassing environment where those who dared to speak were punished .
for start @-@ ups such as Glint , the desire to have an overview is a lucrative business option .
the global governance , regulation and conformity area can be worth more than USD 118.7 billion by 2020 , according to the statistics on financial ethics .
Denveris Colorados , a start @-@ up company , which will help businesses to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour , noted in the light of the dubious reputation of Ubber this year an increase in interest and activity .
there are almost 600 customers , including Airbus , Microsoft and Tesla .
the Uber has recently registered himself as a customer .
as in Glinter , the coalition companies will be able to send tailor @-@ made impulses , to collect real @-@ time confidential answers and to look at the problematic areas of heat cards .
it also offers anonymous messages to enable workers to report unsuitable behaviour .
and when it comes to the executive director , complaints go directly to the Bureau .
&quot; public opinion has been anchored by regulators , &quot; said Patrick Quinlan and CEO Patrick Quinlan .
Quinlan said that if a company is found to treat its workers badly or to act immorally , the company may face serious consequences , such as consumer boycotts , leaving workers and court cases , even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene .
Ruby , the restaurant , which has more than 25 000 employees in 500 places of activity , has been used more than a year to ensure that workers are aware of the rules and procedures and to offer a simple way to interact with the headquarters of the corporation .
if a worker wanted to report the problem earlier , he had to find a telephone number or an email address to the corporation headquarters , and I hope that it will be taken seriously .
it was often a deterrent and inconvenient process , said Mr Vitrano , General Adviser , who said that there was no good way to monitor workers &apos; complaints .
however , at a time when the company is using a census , it is possible to identify problems such as discrimination , harassment or unfair wage practices , which did not previously lead to those operating in other cities or states , more quickly to identify and deal with them .
&quot; I will be able to get closer to the holist 360 @-@ degree experience of the workers , &quot; said Vitrano , who is headed by Mr Ruby &apos;s risk management group .
&quot; and we defend our shareholders for litigation with workers . &quot;
Quinlan said that companies started to take ethical behaviour , values and the involvement of workers more seriously in 2002 , or after the audit company Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical infringements in the Enron scandal .
however , only when &apos; social media became mature &apos; , companies realised that they cannot prevent their black wash from publicly hiding online .
&quot; before using the technology to monitor ethical behaviour , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both Glint and Vienna offer their software as a service , taking advantage of companies &apos; periodic fees for using their products .
this is a business model and an opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors who have been based on both start @-@ ups .
in February 10 million dollars were financed by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Customs Capital , thereby increasing the value of the capital collected by 47 million dollars .
the Glinti invested USD 10 million in November in Bessemer Venture partners , increasing the total funding of the company to USD 60 million .
such investments will not come as a surprise when taking into account the link between companies , culture and venture capital .
more and more research shows that modern workers are waiting for more than before .
in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high wages and interesting projects are merely on the table .
workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued , and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy in a company , they feel they are heard and that the work they do is satisfactory , they are more committed to ensuring the success of a company , &quot; said Nina McQueen , Vice @-@ President LinkedInis , who has a general benefit and the experience of the staff of the Glinti .
investors earn revenue if companies belonging to their portfolio are doing well ; businesses are doing well when workers are committed and involved .
if the analytical tools of the third party allow us to increase the commitment and involvement of workers , we do not think that they will be supported .
the possession of data on the involvement of workers is important , according to experts in the culture of work .
however , these data are useless if the company &apos;s supervisory authorities do nothing to do with them .
in fact , if a company asks for feedback from its employees , it can create expectations that changes are ahead of us .
and if the changes do not take place quickly or not at all , it may cause disappointment and reduce the involvement of workers .
&quot; if you ask 4 000 proposals , you have to be ready for 4 000 conversations , &quot; said Kotter International President Russell Raath , who has seen how companies are making a mistake by relying too much on the collection of data .
&quot; because if things do not go to the end , the workers think : &apos; did you actually listen to me ?
do you care ?
and if you do not care , why should I care ? &apos;
according to Erretti , the Madison Reel , who is now carrying out six studies among workers , has been able to implement measures on the same day as the problem has been reported via Glinti .
and , after the speed of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , it was possible to reorganise several teams in the company and to provide communication training to deal with the problems .
however , Mr Ruby Kyprianou will be collecting new data on workers and it is hoped that , in the long term , it will lead to a longer @-@ term commitment of workers in the industry , known for its large labour flows .
&quot; if you are not committed to ensuring transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vitrano .
&quot; and if you lose people , you will lose your customers .
and if you lose your customers , you will lose businesses . &quot;
the euro area remains a star in Bali : incomes are growing rapidly
although the crisis in 2008 and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic , the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe , BSE , referring to the report by the European Central Bank .
according to the ECB , since 1999 , total economic output per capita in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations .
there is a low debt burden , fast @-@ improving institutions and business @-@ friendly policies .
&quot; the Baltic States , in one of Slovakia , are among the few countries in the euro area , where the EU average has been substantially closer to the middle of the reactor , announced by the Central Bank .
while the aim is to ensure that the overall output of the economy per capita is equal to the Western Europe , in 2015 , the total output of the Baltic economies per capita was just 2 / 3 of the average of 15 countries , which were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement cycle .
low wages have led the balls to seek a better wage abroad .
although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic States in a positive light , and the economy is growing this year , the local population is not enthusiastic .
according to the latest Eurobarometer survey , only a quarter of the population of Latvia and Lithuania assessed that their economies are doing very well or rather well .
in the Czech Republic and Poland , it was slightly less than half of those questioned about their economies .
NCAA decision to cancel two times a day &apos;s trend makes Bruinsi days long
it is almost 23 o &apos;clock when the fund UCLA football clubs will be stopped at the edge of a new exercise in a team &apos;s university .
some of them have been burdened by a company , revealing the efforts of the first day of their training camp .
for a large part of the team , they are offering a midday break .
the players involved in the course of the cucumbers will go back after a three @-@ hour trend to learn from a joint life , before returning at 6.30 meetings next morning to the WWman football club .
&quot; the next three days will be a real challenge for them , &quot; said Bruinsi treach , Jim Mora , shortly before the Monday became Tuesday .
the NCAA decision to cancel the burden of players on a two @-@ day basis has actually changed their days longer - at least until the end of the end @-@ up to one side on Friday .
for this reason , the three first operations of the UCLA were prompted to start at 19.15 , in order to fit players into the already tight timeline .
the transition from two to two strikes a day means more than one trend - the beginning of the Bruinsi camp was raised almost a week ahead of the previous season , and for the first time in Mora &apos;s six Westward season , there will be workshops during summer courses .
they have until 20 August an agenda of 18 trends before the formal preparation of the opening game against Texas A &amp; M in September begins .
according to Mora , he is in favour of the change of the NCAA rules , although it adds another item to the close schedules of players .
&quot; they have a huge burden on three or four days , and this is a serious challenge , &quot; said Mora .
&quot; and they break themselves through this challenge ; they are struggling , they are nice young people .
I believe that if we arrive on Saturday and we have more time , it will be a truly good thing . &quot;
if the camp is closed , the UCLA workings will be closed down , which is not an easy task , given the clear view of the parking plate of their fields and by @-@ standby Luskini , a higher @-@ class hotel , which has already become a gateway from the net of protection from the gates .
since this weekend , hotels are occupied by the Bruinsi players , but Mora acknowledged that problems may arise during the season with free tobacco .
&quot; we are implementing security measures , &quot; said Mora .
&quot; this is a real concern , and it is not exaggerated to think that people can filter a dozen and treasuries .
if there is a record of a train , it can do a good deal .
but we are using a security team there and 8 parking stations .
we will do our best to use it .
I will try not to worry about this .
we have a plan in place . &quot;
the cost of the election union of Saduare @-@ Ivanova , who was expelled from the Reform Party , Kristiina Ojuland and the ECB forced to leave the forces of Maria Kaljs in the hands of our Tallinn , and the parties to the ECB , will be able to show the establishment of a business union in Tallinn - it seems to be as much as political parties in party politics at least as much as political parties this year .
however , buses will be considered in the autumn , and the key issue will be whether there are enough disappointed voters to all of them .
who will remain with the Sahel ?
if a small reduction has been made in the support of Edgar Saduare , the events of his electoral union can be predicted .
one of the members of the country , some former and current middle @-@ party groups and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union ?
and is there any reason why , in Tallinn , some of the faithful faiths and sisters of Saduare , to evade the candidacy of the &apos; Saduare list &apos; , which is the subject of suspicion of corruption and corruption , is becoming a reality ?
on the Russian @-@ speaking poem of a film @-@ driven music caldeo , which takes part in the city of Lasnamäe ; and in any sense , the original computer game in which Prime Minister Jüri Ratas , the Prime Minister Jüri Ratas , has to avoid lomnipe and hurricane - is it the first time that the central party is trying to avoid the votes of the 16th and 17th year @-@ old voters who are allowed to take part in the ballot box ?
we look forward to the perception of the other political parties of the youth campaign .
if the Kanal 2 or TV3 viewers , instead of the beginning of August , there will be two options : to accept that , in the future , only ETV , ETV2 , ETV + , Tallinn TV and English France24 channels or surrender each month to a few TV operators .
there are probably also those who openly welcome the free television experience at the beginning , but at the end of the day - albeit reluctantly - pay for television and advertisements .
the deafening music , the people and the rubbish left on the streets are the unpleasant side of almost every major musical festival .
however , if you do not want to be part of the ocean , it is worth going to the home country , rather than being painted at home , to be able to go - and to sleep for the Coptic sum of the Festival .
Washington changes the rules of the Green Card
media publications are quoted by President Donald Trumpi , who says that a new US immigration plan , which makes the green card rules .
the plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 people per year , stricter rules for obtaining temporary employment visas and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visas .
the new rules have been proposed by the Republican and the President supports them .
the draft legislation will be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers &apos; money , as it will change the way in which green maps are issued to citizens of other countries in the US .
the law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme .
the new application process gives an advantage to the candidates who speak English and who have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economies , &quot; said Trump American media publications .
Siberian young people are moving to the city , pensioners back to the land .
Jevseyev Anatololi continues the tradition of the famous seto gold miners of the River Maana .
he is working 140 kilometres away from home to Maana Kuvai as a motor driver .
this is a tough job : two months of work without rest days , and then only 10 days at home and again .
during the three years of the Artel , Anatoll has seen only one time .
&quot; there is a resounding procedure : in passing , there will be a thorough check that the reference does not lead to it , and when it comes to doing so , it is Anatoly .
Mare Piho &apos;s conversation in the village of Haida with the local seto Jaga , who has spoken a lot about the memory of his family in Siberia .
the archaic culture of Siberian setopes is also beginning to affect the homes , because it is simply so shocking , thinks the most far @-@ sighted mixtures have been investigated by Piho Mare .
his first investigation trip to Siberia will be 30 years later this year .
during this period , he has been there 14 times and has lived there for one year .
how much was the case in Siberia at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century in order to get land here ?
this is an unresolved issue .
I would argue that 8 000 .
I have taken note of this in the words of Siberian seto men , who have also thought about it .
it is very difficult to say , because at the time , up to 30 people could come up in one group , but the passport was only given to a man .
the passport was only given to one , but it was children , sisters and women .
look at how much this territory was here .
this was a number of times greater historical Setomay .
after all , it was necessary to educate , in some way .
Setos came here as farmers , but their lives changed , because here they came to regions that were not only involved in agriculture but also in the river ( palgiparation ) , gold mines , industry .
for example , in New Petsert , many pigs went to work later in Krasnojarsk @-@ 45 ( where the Soviet power built the uranium enrichment plant - J. P. ) , when it was formed .
was it the majority of the population in the region at the time ?
yes , they lived in a Compact .
in addition , a long tradition of marriage is maintained , and a lot of children .
seven @-@ eight children were commonplace .
how much is the culture of Siberian setopes different and different from that of the mother country ?
they are different , although what was said here was never the same .
they brought a great deal of money .
they then also made themselves ( the shadow ideas ) , but they always made a distinction between what was included and what was done here .
climate change has been severely affected by the traditional rivalry , because there is , after all , cold .
the changes have been made .
for example , Setomaal meat was salt , but here it was simply frozen .
where are the villages of Siberia and what life is living there ? / graphics : Alari Paluends
the link with the mother country was spiritually strong , it was considered very important .
it seems to me that it is now starting to give back to the Setuony , to influence them .
those girls who have lived here in families have listened to amazing stories .
Piho must bear in mind the people of the Estonian delegation , who came to Haida at the beginning of July to the Kingdom of Haida , and lived four days in homes - J. P .
what is still here is shocking .
&quot; it is very easy to come and also to go , because the city has a wonderful location : the railway link and the roads at the crossroads of the road , says Reigo Tamm , Reigo Tamm .
the city is no longer just a military capital , we have a great deal of hope , sport and culture , and the carrot will be in every corner .
Tapa is a tip @-@ up city !
there is a small island in the Linera through the current White river , where the Tamils tend to be hijacked .
&quot; this beautiful train window does not appear to be &apos; , haggles Reigo .
those who are not afraid of cold water can be flooded in the river , because the river is full of resources .
I have been flooding there , you can do it !
the water of the river can be considered long and simply to do the romantics - it can look at the flow of the river and think about life and want .
I have also been there with my own names .
Ooperisolist Tamm has , apart from anything else , been getting used to the three bridges between the river basin : &apos; that it is a place at the city , no one may come to answer if their stories &apos; .
&quot; there is a wonderful view of the Tapy mountain , but there are also health professionals where you can drink , winter skies and now , for example , to play a golf game - the golf path has been made , the chains can be borrowed from sports centres , the Reigo .
the old professional bodies , of course , go there , but I have not yet got to play there .
obviously , my colleague , Mrs Rasmus , must be invited to visit Tapale , because she has experienced cgolfimans and she has a chain .
perhaps he will lend me !
Reigo and Männia were inseparable from the current period of childhood .
at least during the hours .
there is a lot of tears , frustration and rest in my sporting life .
not to mention the collapse of bells and suicides .
&quot; the entire city is now full of construction works , all of this will become unknown , &quot; endorses Reigo .
however , the old and tired building is a very attractive place in which oral discoveries are being played .
I am pleased that in 2012 , the head of R.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.M , welcomed my idea , and the summer theatre of his theatre had to be done .
although this year &apos;s theatre season &apos; Aleksei Karenin &apos; has just been carried out , on 11 August , the railway station is &apos; Elluwake &apos; , when the old building is moving around in the 1980s .
&quot; from 11 to 13 August , Tapa City Days , which has been replaced by an open house site , and will take place in a series of cultural events , among other things , the Reigo , who is proposing to visit the city of 91years in just a few days .
the museum has already been in 1994 since 1 May of the Ppersonal yellow house .
&quot; the house is small , but there is a great deal of publicity and information enormously , &quot; endorses the Reigo site , which is full of the history of Tapa town , most of which focuses on the railways and sister .
Reigo muds that , if you go through all the proposed sites , you will go on a long distance , but fortunately the small town is full of coffee .
&quot; we have such good eating places and when we sit in coffee , sometimes you have the feeling that you are abroad , he describes .
educated and young Tapy soldiers spend a lot of time in pubs , sestap there is a mixed feeling that you are in Estonia and your home town , but there is such an international company together .
I believe it would be very exciting to listen to the stories of the French or the Americans .
the wars , yes , we are going to have a lot !
two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal tendering in Greece
Telekanal bTV quoted a Ministry of Foreign Affairs who announced that two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal tendering .
in the morning of 1 August , the police arrested people who illegally ordered a group of people on the island of Sithonia , including two Bulgarians .
they were released on the same day , but there is currently an investigation .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said to the TV channel that Bulgarians were later released .
the Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free tendering and are already imposing severe fines on all those who are caught in a place of cleansing , which is not intended for this .
checks will continue throughout the season .
according to the Ministry , the Court may impose fines .
the wolves that teach the junta are going to break the sheep .
the farmers on the shelves must once again give the wolves of their carpet &apos; educational material &apos; - probably the wolves that taught the junta have already broken down a number of sheep .
this year , the wolves in the Hiiu County have broken sheep three times , with 23 sheep and injured eight , writes the Hiiu page .
the soil was only three years before 124 .
there are also data from the Environment Agency in the Murdles that the soil was not born on the shelves of the soil , and Hiiuland hunting Council information that this year has been fixed on the island of two wolves .
on Monday night , the wolves unleashed 15 sheep in the village of Kabul , and injured in 18 survivors .
in the morning of the morning , the wolves in the village of Rehemas have broken down one of the sheep and wounded by one of you who had to make an emergency killer .
rules on the management of genetically modified crops must be clear
the Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft law on the release of genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) and the draft law on the amendment of plant protection products .
the amendment to the law removes the creation of a separate collection of data for both genetically modified ( GM ) crops and operators , which will continue to be used for plant health registers .
in addition , the GM crop management and the obligation to have prior agreement with the designated radio apiculture person will be amended .
although there is currently no cultivation of GM crops in Estonia , we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of GM and non @-@ GM crops .
this is at least as long as there is no decision to declare Estonia GMO @-@ free , &quot; said Sigmar Suu Kyi , the President of the plant health department at the Ministry of Rural Affairs .
&quot; at the same time , it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate , taking into account the costs and administrative burden for both private and public sectors , in the Annex .
the draft law repeals the provisions relating to the collection and treatment of GM crops in GM crops and operators , lays down requirements for the management of GM crops and the requirements for starting economic activities .
specifically , in relation to the beekeeping sector , the obligation to inform beekeepers of the cultivation of GM crops is replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with beekeepers before bringing up cultivation .
the draft law has been sent to the ministries for coordination .
all interested parties have the opportunity to examine the draft information system and , if they so wish , to submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs .
the proposed changes will affect , in particular , those operating in the area of plant farming , beekeepers and the agricultural profession .
in the European Union , including Estonia , only one GM crop - maize mon 810 .
so far , however , no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing GM crops .
the reason is that in Estonia there is no mammoth , the European media , which is resistant to the magic line mon 810 .
it has also been extended to the southern regions , and it is not suitable for our climate conditions in May .
in order to obtain certainty , the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect the seeds of a possible GM contamination in Estonia , maize and soya varieties .
the results of the samples carried out showed that seeds were not included in the seeds , and the study concluded that the seeds of rape , maize and soya varieties in Estonia did not contain genetically modified organisms .
in turn , it can be concluded that in Estonia , GM crops are not deliberately cultivated , and it was also confirmed that there has been no random contamination .
Jose Mourinho thinks that Manchester United colours Nemanja Maticu in the form of &apos; genetic genius &apos;
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United States has recruited Nemanja Maticu in the form of &apos; genetic genius &apos; , after a central player against Samlov on Wednesday evening .
GBP 40 million of the game bought from Chelsea started in Dublin , in the last seasonal game of the Unitedi , before the UEFA Super Cupi line against Madrid on Tuesday 2 @-@ 1 , impressed by the role of defence , while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on attacks .
however , having left aside from the Blueprint for seasonal Asia , Maticl was badly needed to bury and he had only received 45 minutes , which , according to Mourinho , must be corrected before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but he has experience , intelligence , genious thinking - he has a football mindset , &quot; said Mourinho .
&quot; we will help him to achieve a form as soon as possible . &quot;
as in the past , the Aviva stadium also started with other new recruited Victor Lindelof and Romlu Mubarak , and Mourinho began to put in place a man who started in the beginning of the season .
the Independent public week revealed that Mourinho still wants to recruit three football clubs , but he confirmed that the club has already done a &apos; excellent job &apos; by concluding agreements with three of its four priority options .
&quot; I am grateful to the club that they were able to realise three four , &quot; he added .
&quot; I am even more happy if they are able to make four four , but they have worked hard for me . &quot;
another warm son was on the verge of the GSM Embassy on 1 August and this time in Muhus .
according to Mati Martinson , an observer living in Sfragile Martinson , we received the first cumber to be equipped with the embassy in Sfragile , and this washing cell is already flying around , leaving the washing ground and joining the Multi @-@ Grand Gulf of Mullutu .
this is because , after all , there are no fertility fields , the voice of the islands is written .
this Tuesday , in a relatively late way , it has become yet another son , and it was on the island of Muhu .
according to Martinson , the installation of embassies is actually an international project that is being carried out by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojka .
the soil was supplied by a son called Mati GSM , Sfragile ves Turkey .
&quot; his actions are all on the internet : how he went to Spain in winter , back a long time in the German and Polish border , and then Saareland came , Martinson spoke .
British inventors to install a microchip in their own body in order to access their homes and cars .
the British inventor became the first person in a country to have a microchip installed in order to be able to open up a mere handful of its own privileges , to access the office and even to launch a car .
33 @-@ year @-@ old Steven Northam children to install a small chip between their fingers and the finger of names , and now provides this service to businesses and private individuals who want to make their lives easier through technology .
he has joined forces with Dr Geoff Watson , a consultant @-@ anestesiologist of the Royal hospital in Winchester in Hants , in order to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards .
the technology is similar to the microchip that is installed on cats and coaches , and it takes only 30 seconds for the procedure .
the Northam company will also replace the houses of houses and cars , so that they are compatible with the chip , asking for GBP 300 per cent .
this is a child &apos;s father of a child who has now installed the technology both at home and in his car , BMW Z4 , which is going to start when he has his hand in the wheel .
the White House has cost taxpayers thousands of
according to the military documents announced in the magazine , the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicopter last month for an event involving American production in the south of the horror of the taxpayer was to pay even USD 24 000 .
the green and white colour Sikorsky VH @-@ 3D , which is called Marine One during the President of the President of the Council , was a central feature of the event that took place on 17 July in Valges Main .
President Donald Trump , Vice @-@ President Mike Pence and the White House senior officials reported on industrial products from all 50 states .
the helicopter built in Connecticutis was built together with the image of the hunt , Wisconten from the fire @-@ fighting car and the Mississium .
according to the Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX @-@ 1 ) documents , the Helicopter Squadron , the Helicopter Squadris , called for the presence of a white house in a military cabinet helicopter , or FARGO , to 36 hours before the helicopter for the &apos; extraordinary &apos; event in the south of the horror .
&quot; I wanted you to be aware of this , because it is an unusually high @-@ profile event , &quot; said HMX @-@ 1 komandör a day before the event , in the e @-@ mail , the Deputy officer of the naval force in the field of aviation .
the message stated that helicopter arrives in the south of 17 July this morning at 7 : 00 at 15 : 00 , and remains there until the same evening between 18 and 21 .
it was added that , if the departure of the White House were to be present , a second epathy is needed because of the restrictions on working time .
the original air crew was at the helicopter during the event , and the security team of the estur was close to the aircraft near the ground throughout the period .
it was not possible to read out from the documents given to the magazine whether or not the second ethos were eventually needed .
the Hatch law prohibits federal workers to use the government &apos;s assets for political purposes .
the documents show that HMX @-@ 1 examined whether this event could violate this provision .
&quot; we asked whether this is a violation of Hatch &apos;s law , and we were told that it was not , &apos; he wrote a commander &apos; .
&apos;It seems that you have no choice , &apos; responded to the leading officer &apos;s Deputy .
the White House announced the event as a formal event in America and the Hatch law would not have covered it .
however , even official events have political undertones .
the President supported the efforts of health reform in the Senate at the time in the Senate and praised the efforts to keep government regulations in jeopardy .
the use of the aircraft known as &apos; Marine One or Air Force &apos; for a politically profitable purpose is not a new phenomenon .
Presidents must use them to travel .
however , the requirement to use these purely photographs is unusual .
in February , the Trump came to the attention of his first campaign event in Floridas Melbourne , President @-@ in @-@ Office of the President , and Twitter &apos;s account of the messages that complain about how his predecessor , the President of his predecessor , used the aircraft .
&quot; the White Mal is very pleased to see the &apos; made in America &apos; in America , where products were represented in all 50 states made by American workers , &quot; said Lindsay Walters , the spokesman of the White House .
HMX @-@ 1 teams are often carrying out tests around Washington and the southern horror in order to get the US President &apos;s white house down with a centimetres .
when the Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , the HMX @-@ 1 White House was organised by 58 samples .
according to the official , the flight was considered to be the norm for the &apos; American @-@ made &apos; flight crew at the time of a month .
the Eskar helicopter was flying at the time 11 hours for &apos; non @-@ subsidy missions &apos; .
according to the White House , none of the other forms of this event did not burden the taxpayers &apos; purses .
according to Sikorsky &apos;s representative , the company was not involved in carrying out helicopters in the southern horror .
HMX @-@ 1 does not maintain the budgetary documents and the precise costs of the President &apos;s flights are difficult to find out .
however , at the time of the defence Ministry for the financial year 2017 , VH @-@ 3D will be reimbursed at USD 24 380 per hour .
in Eskaadr &apos;s documents , the main base of the flight was 30 minutes from the Quantico airport to Virginia in both directions .
the White House claims that the actual cost of using helicopter is well below the amount .
&quot; the calculation of taxpayers &apos; expenditure on the basis of estimated compensation rates is very misleading , &quot; said Walters .
&quot; these estimated compensation rates include staff , care and many other irreversible costs , which will be taken into account in the annual appropriations . &quot;
according to the 2015 rand study , the Ministry of Defence does not include compensation rates for personnel costs , but they cover costs related to fuel , maintenance and contracts .
the former press representative of the White House Sean Spicer defended the use of helicopter at the time .
&quot; the point is to show the things that have been made in America this week , &quot; said Spicer .
&quot; and I know that the State of Sikorsky and Connecticuti is very proud that they contribute to our national security and that there are supposedly hundreds , if not even thousands of people whose work depends on it .
and I believe that just like most Americans , we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment , which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .
so , of course , it is right to highlight this . &quot;
it is not clear whether or not the Trump was a helicopter in the south of the horror of the event , or not , but he was hiding behind the fire @-@ fighting car .
in the White House , Trump Sikorsky addressed representatives of the Trump Sikorsky , giving a joke to media publications on company products in his personal aircraft .
&quot; I know Sikorská very well , &quot; said President , &quot; I have three products . &quot;
Gari Šadeiko - Tastears arrived in peace and joy
the 2011 MMil Daetis hit Šadeikot in the last area , 800 m beverages and a stadium was taken away from the stadium .
shortly before that , he had received a zero @-@ sum leap in China .
the Helsinki formula for 2012 was an asset for the loss of cheap injuries , but in London , it received 60 13 points 23 .
however , I have continued .
after 2013 , Moscow MMil received a day @-@ to @-@ day parental injury on Estonia &apos;s record .
two years later , he became the 15th seat of Beijing and met the Olympic Games , but this was more than a disappointment to the athletes .
the Raskedalipu was only passed through the soil of Šadeiko , when the outcome of the Amsterdam Embassy was not received at the beginning .
I would just like to put together a proper multi @-@ contest once or one time .
once again , you sprayed Šadeiko .
worse still , a month later , his Olympic contest in Rios reievigastery was already in the first hurdle .
the time had to be taken down - is there to continue with the seven competition at all ?
is the two @-@ day effort worth all of this ?
Neiu thought a long time , but found peace .
I have been able to think about it .
it is relatively difficult to describe this experience , but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen .
fortunately , there was time for us to treat ourselves and to think about it .
&quot; I knew that I am not going to put a cool on the picture , &quot; speaks of his self @-@ cleansing .
I was able to turn a clean page and go ahead with the new momentum .
Treener Anne hill has said that it was very difficult to look at the suffering of negligence , but he understood that , above all , the sportsman himself has to come up with clarity .
after all , he was so repressed by all .
it was difficult to tolerate .
&quot; however , he said that he does not give up and he wants to prove what he is worth , says remember .
now there is some kind of peace .
he is doing so to joy .
the contest came back in May , when the Šadeiko set a new Estonian record of 6280 points at the Götzise multi @-@ contest .
in a high @-@ level competition , he improved his personal excellence in the heat of nearly a metre ( 13.89 ) and drink a record of a record @-@ close @-@ time barrier .
then there was a feeling of multiple competition , that it is not at all a ceiling , but it was only the first hunger to be defeated .
for years , he has been guided by a word of memory that Šadeiko is a black student .
he is ready to be sportsman , he is a good training .
if something is wrong or wrong , he says it immediately .
he feels his own body and trusts his sense .
that is what we must do .
I cannot say what exactly must be done and we follow it .
the new approach has also been found in Šadeiko .
&quot; I am not the one who is going to make the most of the trend , he will speak and say that the most important thing is to get the right sense , because it will also ensure a good result .
baby walks will be happy to do so .
the good emotion has also been offered to the Sadeikou .
both his former friend , Maris hill and Grete , recently became grandparents and has received support from new weather citizens .
&apos;It has been quite interesting &apos; , says Šadeiko .
one alcohol whose drinking is tantamount to &apos; training &apos; .
Livestrong writes that Dr Gordon Sheperd is a father of such a great wine game that he believes - wine can be trained better than any other thing in the world .
Sheperd is a neuroscientist University of Yale .
his message is not about alcohol or about how it affects our feelings and ideas , but instead about the &apos; very active &apos; wine flavourings process .
when it comes to the Council , the wine was complicated by enjoying it , and when we perceive it , we are putting our brain to work in order to create a taste for wine .
according to the Sheperdi , there is not actually a taste of cattle , but a taste in the way in which wine is stimulated .
he will bring a comparison to how the brain &apos; sees &apos; colour &apos; .
&quot; taste is not in wine , taste creates wine and &apos; says Sheperd .
the things that are still affecting the taste of wine are , for example , our vanity , gender and even the amount of coal that man produces .
Sheperd , of course , is that wine is not in order to be full of July .
&quot; there must be more &apos; , he says .
if you have too much longest , the system is overcrowded .
over @-@ wine drinking can harm the brain instead of profit - according to the 2004 survey , people who drink more than three glass wine , memory loss , loss of balance and reduced mental capacity .
10 % of workers in the ICT sector in Estonia receive less pay for colleagues
the figures reveal that 10 % of employees in the ICT sector in Estonia are paid less than their colleagues .
the 10 % pay gap is between men and women , the portal Geenius writes .
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the ICT sector pay study .
a total of 8 577 posts were examined .
63 % of posts were employed by men .
&quot; although only 3 companies said that the pay gap is in favour of men and the rest of the companies , the reality is that there is no pay gap , compared to the average salary of men per month is 10 % higher than that of women and men per year on average 8 % higher than that of women , &quot; said Foncrates analysts Ilmar North .
the clip of the &quot; Narcose &quot; 3 season : now that Pablo Escobar has gone , Netflix hittsark at the centre of Cali cartel
despite the fact that &apos; Narcose &apos; in the second season revealed the killer of Pablo Escobari , the Netflix sari is far from over .
the third and fourth season has been confirmed by the quota services , and the first of them has already been produced by the advertising clip , which is fragile with the sardines and new pathogens .
in the third season , DEA will pay its attention to the world &apos;s richest drug organisation - Cali cartels .
they are acting under the leadership of four powerful threats , such as Ford 500 companies , simply with more bribery to the government and more violent actions .
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela ( Damian Alcazar ) is the leader of the cartel , Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela ( Francisco Denis ) , Pacho Herrera ( Alberto Ammann ) , is leading links with Mexico and Chepe Santates London ( Pepe Rapazote ) in New York .

according to the UN , Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
the head of the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that the elections can only represent the people if all members of society , including women , play a role in them .
the leader of the United Nations Assistance Mission , Nicholas Haysom , said that hundreds of women are standing in local Soviet elections , three women are standing as Vice @-@ President and more than 30 % of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; the importance of women &apos;s role cannot be exaggerated , &quot; said in the statement on Wednesday .
the elections can truly represent the people and be credible only if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process .
the local council elections in Afghanistan and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April .
the Taliban , for their part , have threatened the electoral process , which coincides with a transitional period in which the role of international military operations becomes advisory .
this year &apos;s elections will mark the first time that power is given calmly from one democratically elected government to the next .
according to Hamas , women &apos;s strong role will increase the success of democracy in Afghanistan .
according to the Afghan independent electoral Commission , 1.2 million women have registered 3.6 million registered voters .
the joy of sharing makes every thing more acute , both in large and small .
there is always too little common time , but the trend is a good opportunity to combine meetings , games , proximity and burdens .
and what a convenient solution - wherever you were in the summer , live living in the summer , is always accompanied by the summer , and you will be impatiently reminded of your fine voice : &apos; we are now making a trend ! &apos;
it is a very good game of gold , and it is a very good thing to bypass the flag of the coastline .
one is the foundation of permanent footwear and tuna - who would then like to take the form of sand coded in the summer over the summer ?
it is nice to use children instead of chicken .
firstly , it is secure and convenient , and the race is gradually growing at the same pace as training and force .
it is also possible to make villages with quite large children .
the child is training a balance , counts the corps and feels the opportunity to be high and important .
bigger children can do their own villages at the same time .
the scale of the movement is in place and you are going to have a grip on the ground .
the fingers directly , the paltry minimised properly .
the child can read the flats and feel as a job .
the planet is an extremely high , but hopeless exercise for the child .
however , it is easy to make things easier .
in the game @-@ plank : take a long plank to a long plank , which is repeated .
in fact , it is more difficult than usual , but much easier to do if , in the meantime , a friend can give hands .
to add the burden , we can keep the plants , the small market , and we can also walk around .
in addition , the puzzle of a child can be planted , but this exercise offers a break for all children .
at the same time , while the crabs are joining the sand , the triumph , ash and air meat burden , such as the infection .
a child walks on their feet so that his body is distributed equally in advance and behind .
security can be kept in the hands .
all walking and walking up directly .
I will be able to fly , to fly , to strike a balance and to be difficult .
the life of a small engineer is an exhortation if he gets a small number of things in every fire .
the extra burden will be made by shoes in advance .
check that it would remain in a neutral position .
children themselves have a lot to do with cooking meat in a couple and a plate .
the work and the wedding fuel .
follow the safety of the child , the place of contempt , and the hotel in a neutral position .
all children &apos;s favourite and big fun !
at the same time , the whole body is truly effective .
the sports tools were Ott ( 10 ) , Säde ( 8 ) , happiness ( 4 ) .
from the Philippines to a wide range of the world , a trip to the heart of the mopeds
the workshops have been bundled with the summer class , which has become a product in itself in recent years , which , in one of the right lines , has to be hanged at the top of the hand , and which has been able to be used by traders , despite its modest origin , to display a price label .
it is probably one of the things that has been present in red tape , which is one of the things that has existed in the life of one order , and which has not been aroused by a particular emotion .
it is simply there , and if there is no , there is no overlap .
however , there is now a real victory for beer bags , and moefers have been exchanging their mushrooms for the summer months against simple beer bags .
it is not only a coastline , but today it is just as popular as a street , and more courageous women even walk into office .
at this point , however , it is worth making it clear whether this summer &apos;s summer is still sitting or whether it is worth postponing and slapsing a little more official .
however , the wealth of tolerance has made a real summer love for women .
for example , when we read foreign moeblogists , the first thing is that the moyoghurts will be truthful to the local market as a first thing , and they will acquire some beer bags , which will then be accompanied by a beacon , a market and also as a friend in the city .
some bloggers are even so generous that they are buying from the market a bigger wolf and selling them to their loyal readers .
it is worth noting , however , that there is a demand for readers in the world , so that women in the real world ( and men ! ) are likely to be involved in each other &apos;s fishing zone in order to become a happy owner .
in some ways , this madness is also understandable , because it is rare for them to be repeated when , in the fashion yesterday , it is possible to buy some of the things that have risen to a few EUR 10 .
it is true that white traders have also discovered a simple way of earning money here , and so it is cheaper to sell luxury brands for a few hundred and a thousand euros .
obviously , in order to ensure that the richer customers do not have to feel easy to die , who are propelling around with some cheap bags .
for example , it is possible to buy Dolce &amp; Gabbana over EUR 1 000 in hand .
however , the interpretation of Chanel &apos;s interpretation can be found in the circulation of EUR 6 000 .
in contrast to most of the motives , however , the beer bags do not come from some of the big mosques , but their story began in a far more distant way .
Admittedly , it is far from the Philippines , where they have been subjected to a wide range of them .
there is a lot of red tape , particularly in the case of export business , and there is very often no way in which there is a local export business .
Admittedly , the 14th century of the amusement technique comes from and is quite a series of normal corps .
however , as the beer does not have to be as strongly red as corps , they will be able to have musicians and other materials that are more personalised and , by extension , more active .
in recent times , for example , there are particularly trendy bags where the colour of red colours or skin .
however , the full letter can be sent to the actress Jane Birkini , who was the largest bunch of beer bags before they had been seen .
it was precisely that he sued the beer of all kinds of clothing complex and did not even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival .
however , the popularity of the Copts today does not play a smaller role , but also that caring for them is a hot head and , unlike all the other things , they do not have to care for them with special means , but also the water and the wet .
as in the case of the trend robbery , the brands have come out of all kinds of interpretations , apart from the classical appearance .
for example , if you want to have a red rice , you may have a red @-@ shirt , or a little bit of a boom .
at the same time , it is worth remembering that the classical beer is never going to be a mob , but a beer .
but what is the classical beer ?
for centuries , there has been a classic copy of the beer , which resembles its style of corps , is open , and it is short , as well as beer , crippers .

Aare left on Wednesday evening in his home town of Kärla .
it was the last contact by telephone yesterday , Friday evening , and the positioning of the phone by the man in the Western island , the village of Mblenings , where he was sought with helicopter to midnight and coaches .
his phone was then empty , and the man &apos;s location was therefore no longer able to be identified .

GMB concerns about investment in McVitie &apos;s Glasgow plant
the trade union is expected to be confirmed by the leaders of the long @-@ term production plans at the Glasgow plant in the company Glasgow .
according to GMB Scotland , the company has remained silent on the future of the investment .
more than 500 people are employed in Hobnobsi and rich know @-@ how and other products .
McVitie &apos;s owner , Pladis , said that they have invested more than GBP 5 million in the last few years .
the workers and trade union chairmen have been the first to hear &apos; if something changes in the operation of the plant .
in a letter sent to the company &apos;s objects , GMB Scotland , McVitie , called for &apos; McVitie &apos;s concerns about the lack of funding to modernise production lines &apos; .
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy said : &apos; the fact that we do not get clarity from the head of the site on the business needs and the future investment plan for the future , makes our members deeply concerned .
several generations of families have been working here , and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and the people around Glasgow , as an essential pillar for ensuring decent employment in a region where there is high unemployment and social housing .
therefore , in the context of jobs , wages and welfare in the east of Glasgow , and in the context of Brexti , the rise in living costs and the chronic damage in production , the McVitie company is badly needed . &quot;
the Pladise representative said : &apos; the leader of the Customs Council received a letter from GMB Scotch only yesterday , and the company complies directly with him , because we value an active relationship with workers and trade union representatives .
two months ago , there was a regular meeting between the workers and the representatives of the GMB , which discussed a number of issues openly .
we then discussed with workers that , like all the other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we look at our activities on the ground - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - to ensure our competitiveness .
he added : &apos; in recent years we have invested more than GBP 5 million in the Customs site , most of it has gone into production routes and improvements .
we fully understand the heritage of customs as a source of production , and if there should be any changes in the activities of the object , workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it . &quot;
did the PSG warn Barcelona three years ago for its approach ?
the la can regret its interest in Marco Verratti .
the Paris Saint @-@ Germain does not give up in the attempt to attract Mr Neymar to his ranks by making an offer of GBP 189 million , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago for this record conquest ?
this bold approach has opened the summer as a transitional window , and the Ligue 1 club is ready to break more than double the current world record of buying , which was set at the last season by Paul Pogba returning to Manchester Uniteba for GBP 89 million .
once the transition has been completed , Neyra will become the most expensive player in the world and , at the same time , the highest paid professional athletes in the world , who will be able to pay over GBP 500 000 a week after the payment from the PSG .
Barcelona is also an indication of the way in which the approach has been made , as well as of the liberation of Neyra , although the source of the Catalansi Board confirms that the club has always taken the best care for football since its arrival in Santoz in 2013 .
but did the PSG President warned the football world for such an opportunity three years ago ?
when Manchester City showed an interest in the conclusion of the Blair Agreement in 2014 , the Nasser Al @-@ Khelaif strongly warned all clubs who think about the best players in the PSG .
&quot; I am not worried , because they know that if they concern some of our players , we will be against them and we will contact their players , &apos; said Al @-@ Khelaif .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they try to conclude an agreement with some of our players , they will have to face the consequences . &quot;
the Barcelona seems to have taken over this limit , as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed an interest in the PSG central player , Marco Verratti .
the PSG made it clear that they would not allow them to leave and that the Barcelona can become a setback as a result of this interest , by abolishing one of their precious assets in the form of Neyra .
Prime Minister : Ireland wants to build bridges , not borders , after Brexitit .
&quot; Brexit is seriously threatened between Northern Ireland and Ireland , Great Britain and Ireland , &quot; warned Varadkar first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June .
&apos;I cannot imagine who would benefit from this &apos; , he added .
cross @-@ border infrastructure projects made it possible for the free movement of people and goods , said Varadkar .
&quot; this is our vision for the future : building bridges , not borders , he emphasised .
he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union , and because it is not possible , he would be part of the European single market .
this would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom .
the second option to make Britain &apos;s departure smoother would be the creation of the European Union and the United Kingdom Customs Union , explained by the Irish Prime Minister .
noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey , the Varadkar said : &apos; surely we could have such a British &apos; .
the alternative to this would be to return to customs points , which would be a historic division and a political failure .
&quot; bring about trade , prosperity and peace , &quot; said Irish Prime Minister .
he called Brexitit &apos; our generation challenge &apos; and warned that the result could affect every aspect of the daily lives of Northern Ireland .
the Irish Prime Minister met the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland when visiting Belfast .
