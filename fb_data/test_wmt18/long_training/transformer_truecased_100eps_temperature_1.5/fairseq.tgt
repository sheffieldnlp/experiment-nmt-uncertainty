four Cape Verde group members were detained in Estonia and Spain
in Spain , the so @-@ called Cape Verde group leader of the Estonian Union , S@@ lu@@ ro Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch , who is known in the criminal wor@@ l@@ ds , was detained by the police , according to postal law .
Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch detained in Spain was arrested on trial permission .
yesterday the Court also arrested three suspects in Estonia .
the suspicion is that members of the so @-@ called Cape Verde criminal association are aged between 27 and 57 , who are mainly responsible for drug crimes .
the alleged leader of a criminal association was detained in Mi@@ ja@@ mas , Spain .
in Estonia , three men were detained as a suspect , one of whom , according to data , is a leading figure in a criminal association , and two are members of a criminal organisation .
the data collected indicates that there was a clear division of tasks and roles within the criminal community .
the purpose of the criminal community &apos;s activities was to commit drug crimes and thus generate criminal profits , &quot; commented the head of the pre @-@ trial proceedings in criminal matters , the public Prosecutor Va@@ sil@@ Ver@@ te .
&apos;@@ We are not ruling out that this circle of suspected criminals will increase &apos; , the Prosecutor added .
these are people who have previously taken an interest in law enforcement and some of them have been punished for drug crimes .
Ver@@ te stressed that cooperation with my Spanish colleagues has been important throughout the investigation .
&quot; international cooperation has become common@@ place for us and this week &apos;s operation shows the success of this cooperation , &quot; said Public Prosecutor Ver@@ te .
the head of the Central Criminal Police Department , ago Le@@ is , said that detention was preceded by an investigation going on for nearly one and a half years .
&quot; in the first half of the week , long @-@ standing work became a reality while suspected of committing crimes in Estonia and Spain , &quot; he said .
it added that central police officers were helping with detention in Spain .
for years we have had good contact and understanding of one another with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard .
these de@@ ten@@ tions are yet another message to the criminals that we can get them from another end of Europe , &quot; said Le@@ is .
the information that has been collected so far makes it clear that , while at large , suspected men can continue to commit new crimes , the public Prosecutor &apos;s office requested and approved them by the Court of Justice .
a man arrested in Spain is awaiting his surrender to Estonia .
under this criminal case , property , vehicles and cash have been seized in order to ensure confiscation .
the pen@@ al preliminary criminal proceedings are carried out by the Central Criminal Police Office for organised crime and are managed by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office .
the Tallinn City Court sentenced Mr Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch to blackmail in 2005 and punished him with five years in prison .
in the middle of the last decade , Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch was considered the second most important man in the criminal world of Estonia following the then alli@@ ances Nico@@ lai T@@ aran@@ ko@@ v .
Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch from Cape Verde highlighted in Estonian alli@@ ances in the early 1990s , when he started ex@@ tor@@ tion in Tallinn .
Ad@@ mittedly , he taxed tax@@ ing tax@@ is and prostitution for various ho@@ tels and claimed monthly ro@@ of@@ ing fees for business@@ men .
international joint operations , the confiscation of criminal assets and the entry into force of court judgments confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective .
for example , the most recent judgments , eight defen@@ dants of the so @-@ called D@@ ik@@ ye@@ v criminal community who were confis@@ cated criminal assets of EUR 80 000 , or nine individuals who were sentenced to the effect that Ig@@ or Ale@@ y@@ ni@@ ko@@ v created a criminal association in 2006 aimed at the illegal trade in , and the crime of , contra@@ band and trafficking in human beings in , Eastern and southern Estonia .
the proceeds of crime seized there amount to nearly EUR 71 500 .
in these criminal matters , it has ensured success that police officers exchange information and evidence with their counterparts abroad every day and , if necessary , carry out joint activities in any country of the European Union .
civil rights group war@@ ns Mis@@ sou@@ ris@@ se about travelling
the National Association for the Ad@@ van@@ ised People of C@@ olo@@ red People ( NA@@ ACP ) has warned Mis@@ sou@@ ris@@ se @-@ travelling black people against discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the State .
the Group statement states : &apos; the NA@@ ACP travel mark for Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i State , which runs until 28 August 2017 , calls on all African American passengers , visitors and Com@@ m@@ ons to be particularly attentive and extremely cautious as they move around the State , given the dubious racial events which have taken place recently across the State and which have been highlighted . &apos;
according to NA@@ L@@ N , both the recent Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i law , which makes it more difficult to win cases of discrimination , and the fact that minorities are the targets of state law enforcement to a large extent .
&quot; people &apos;s civil rights are being violated .
they are being pul@@ led off by their sk@@ in colour , beaten or slaugh@@ tered , &apos; said R@@ o Cha@@ pel , President of the NA@@ ACP Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i branch , to The K@@ ans@@ as City Sta@@ r .
&apos;@@ We have never received so much complaints before &apos; .
this is the first such warning that an organisation has issued against a US state .
the group &apos;s expression refers to events such as racist insul@@ ts against black students at Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i University and the death of the 28 @-@ year @-@ old black story S@@ and@@ er@@ si , T@@ en@@ nes@@ see .
S@@ and@@ ers died at the beginning of this year under suspi@@ cious circumstances , after they had petrol running through the state , and Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i was arrested without being charged with a crime .
in addition , the comment refers to a recent report by the Chief Prosecutor of Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i , which shows that the cars of black drivers in the state are 75 % more likely to be stopped than those of the white men .
&apos;@@ The comment is intended to make people aware and warn their families , friends and working partners about what can happen in Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is &apos; said Cha@@ pel .
&apos;@@ People must be ready , whether it means taking bail @-@ in money or informing relatives that they are going through the State &apos; .
the latest information from the F@@ B@@ I Programme on hate crime recorded 100 hate crimes in Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is in 2015 , placing the State in its si@@ x@@ teen@@ th place as regards the number of similar offences .
a travel warning is also a response to a new law by Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i , which makes it difficult to appeal to the company &apos;s courts for discrimination in search of housing or work .
T@@ ex@@ as and Ari@@ z@@ ona , the American Civil Protection Union ( American Civil Society Union ) , had previously issued travel notes after these states adopted immigration laws that obliged the local authorities to arrest people for immigration offences because , according to the AC@@ L@@ U , this increases racial profiling .
normally , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issues travel warnings about other countries , but recently interest groups have started to use this measure as a reaction to certain US laws and trends .
He@@ pati@@ tis : what would anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease ?
He@@ pati@@ tis , or li@@ ver inc@@ in@@ eration , may be caused by five different - A , B , C , D and E he@@ pati@@ tis .
all of these vir@@ uses provo@@ ke a li@@ ver violent infection .
however , at an unhealthy cost , he@@ pati@@ tis B and C are chron@@ ically chronic and can develop further into a li@@ ver cir@@ cus , the li@@ ver horse and the li@@ ver cancer .
Si@@ ul@@ o Ku@@ wa@@ r , an epidemi@@ ological Ad@@ vis@@ er of the Health Agency , states that the phenomenon of acute he@@ pati@@ tis disease is the same for all types of li@@ ver @-@ burning - f@@ ever , fa@@ ti@@ gue , pl@@ undering , birth , po@@ et@@ isation , di@@ al pain , grey emissions , we are sin@@ king horse mackerel , meat and class pain , and sk@@ in and hy@@ th@@ ol@@ lah@@ s .
the crow@@ d name of li@@ ver @-@ burning also comes from the last hour of disease .
children may experience he@@ pati@@ tis without any disease .
the various types of German combustion can only be identified on the basis of laboratory research data .
O@@ ver @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis can become chronic he@@ pati@@ tis and go on without disease for decades , which means that you may not know anything about your hazardous li@@ ver disease .
Mr Ku@@ wa@@ r points out the various forms of he@@ pati@@ tis and describes their evolution in greater detail .
He@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses the disease from man to person and infec@@ ts us when eating contaminated food or drinking the water , by sex , by be@@ ating out the infected person and from a hand@@ ful of foodstuffs , soils , objects , swe@@ ets and drug consumption .
a he@@ pati@@ tis infection is caused by family members and carers at risk of disease , people suffering from chronic li@@ ver diseases , people who are infected by sex , men who are sex with men , drug addi@@ cts , passengers who visit countries with high he@@ pati@@ tis A .
infection can be prevented by vacc@@ inations , in particular , by recommending vaccination for people who travel a lot and who are at risk of he@@ pati@@ tis A .
in addition , it is important to comply with daily hygiene requirements : to was@@ h or dis@@ infec@@ t hands , before being used for food , to was@@ h all fruit and vegetables .
b . he@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses ill to come into contact with the blood of human beings , injec@@ tion of drugs , he@@ pati@@ tis , honour treatment , blood @-@ contaminated fo@@ me@@ ters ( den@@ tists , means of pregnancy ) , donor blood , he@@ pati@@ tis , sex and he@@ pati@@ tis disease from animals / inf@@ ants .
Sy@@ n@@ ant drug users at risk of he@@ pati@@ tis infection , sex partners of the infected person , sex men with the infected mother &apos;s new@@ born , sick family members and carers , blood and other body flu@@ ids face health care , rescue workers and police officers and passengers visiting countries with high he@@ pati@@ tis B .
in order to prevent he@@ pati@@ tis , it is possible to vacc@@ in@@ ate people ; in particular , it is recommended to vacc@@ in@@ ate people at risk , as well as people suffering from chronic diseases , HIV infections , sexu@@ ally transmitted diseases and diabe@@ tes .
b ) The other preventive measures against he@@ pati@@ tis are : prevention of the use of alien hygiene and man@@ ic@@ y@@ ms , other ther@@ ap@@ y tools and need@@ les , re@@ par@@ ation and honour , and use of con@@ d@@ oms in the event of a dangerous mix@@ ture of infection or the prevention of sexual risk behaviour .
vaccination against he@@ pati@@ tis b is part of the national immun@@ isation scheme and is free of charge for children in Estonia .
He@@ pati@@ tis C vir@@ uses the disease when you are exposed to human blood , injec@@ tion of drugs , pa@@ tho@@ gens , honour treatment , blood @-@ contaminated fo@@ e@@ tal use , donor blood , he@@ pati@@ tis @-@ recipient sex and he@@ pati@@ tis @-@ ill fo@@ e@@ der / inf@@ ant .
Sy@@ n@@ dro@@ ve drug users are at risk of he@@ pati@@ tis C infection , infected people &apos;s sex partners , sex men with men , new@@ born mothers of the infected mother , sick family members and carers , blood and other body flu@@ ids are exposed to health care , ba@@ il@@ outs and poli@@ ce@@ men , persons with HIV infection , and passengers visiting countries suffering from he@@ pati@@ tis .
He@@ pati@@ tis C is a preventive measure : prevention of the use of alien hygiene and man@@ ici@@ des , other ther@@ ap@@ y tools and need@@ les , re@@ par@@ ation and honour , and the use of con@@ d@@ oms in the event of a dangerous mix@@ ture of infection .
there is no vaccine against he@@ pati@@ tis C .
He@@ pati@@ tis D causes he@@ pati@@ tis , a virus which is ri@@ fe in the presence of he@@ pati@@ tis B .
as a result , he@@ pati@@ tis D suffers from infection with he@@ pati@@ tis B or from chronic he@@ pati@@ tis B as a super@@ infection .
d he@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses exposure to blood and other body liquids , contaminated need@@ les , sexu@@ ally and inf@@ requ@@ ently infected fo@@ et@@ uses .
He@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis is a chronic he@@ pati@@ tis B virus and non @-@ conver@@ ts to he@@ pati@@ tis B .
an effective preventive measure is vaccination against he@@ pati@@ tis B vaccine , which also protects people from infection with he@@ pati@@ tis D .
He@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses fe@@ e@@ ble drinking water and food , including little heat @-@ treated beef , fish and marine sh@@ ell@@ fish , donor blood , collective need@@ les and infected fo@@ et@@ uses .
passengers may be infected by he@@ pati@@ tis in high mor@@ bid@@ ity countries .
F@@ pati@@ tis preventive measures include the enforcement of hygiene requirements : was@@ hing or dis@@ infec@@ ting hands after be@@ ating , before food is made and ea@@ ten after sick care .
F@@ ru@@ its and vegetables are was@@ hing before consumption , avoiding the feeding of little heat @-@ treated beef , fish and se@@ af@@ ood , drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug consumption .
even though competitors tried to printing off the four @-@ year Olympic winners in the last round , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old F@@ ara@@ h has found power in the final straight and won 2@@ 6.@@ 4@@ 9.@@ 51 .
F@@ ara@@ h did not think for long , drawing the hus@@ band , T@@ ania , and children with him after the fin@@ ch .
this was a special moment for me .
I very much love my family .
they were wonderful to be on their path , &quot; said F@@ ara@@ h to the journalists .
F@@ ara@@ h aims at the fifth title competition in London , which is running from 5 000 to 10 000 metres of gold .
everything is possible if there is a belief in it .
in spite of the title , Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;@@ Con@@ imi@@ i &apos;s &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; , a mag@@ nific@@ ent story of the Climate B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri t@@ ree , runs far deeper than the birth of one of the works of art in the late 19th century and early 20th century in Vienna .
but even more in history .
a more narrow subject would have been allowed to have more effect on the extraordinary fo@@ d@@ der allowed in the title of a blo@@ g .
at the moment , the story of A@@ tel B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri , which was portra@@ yed in Da@@ am gold by some of the camer@@ as , and a much larger and more comprehensive newspaper from estee@@ med Jewish families and the German occupation , along with its implications in Austria , would be like two books between some of them .
the first third of the book takes a w@@ ed@@ ding Vi@@ in cultural life in the middle of Vienna and who himself entered the Austrian capital , may well imagine how life went around R@@ ing@@ st@@ ras@@ s over a hundred years ago or how the Cen@@ tr@@ al coff@@ ee all turned their heads when the climate came in .
the concentration of cultural figures in one of the rich@@ est European cities was a high and well @-@ known name , seeing itself as if it were more like a grams of culture .
however , for example , the fact that S@@ ig@@ mun@@ d Fre@@ ud acted in a city in which proliferation of un@@ treated ar@@ son and Europe was the highest level of su@@ ici@@ des , creates progress as if it were nothing more .
or perhaps , however , every couple of beau@@ ty la@@ yers add colour to the early 20th century cultural life in Vienna .
dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
in the last few decades of the 19th century , the number of Jews had explo@@ ded in Vienna , becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe .
almost one in ten Vi@@ in inhabitants had an exchange of views .
the parents , too , were new@@ com@@ ers in Vienna , but by the time the hel@@ ple@@ ss@@ ness of A@@ rad was twice opened up with the Czech sugar mag@@ na@@ ad Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ lo@@ ch and the Climate for his famous pa@@ int@@ ings , his father had already become the seventh largest bank in the H@@ ab@@ s@@ burg E@@ mp@@ ire .
but A@@ de@@ let the whole li@@ mo@@ rous life to which he belon@@ ged was not taken .
when you look at the &apos; Da@@ ami gold &apos; , it is hard to believe that , in the end of life , it was infected by a great Lady soci@@ alism and dre@@ am@@ t of travelling from the Soviet Union .
by 19@@ 33 , when Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ lo@@ ch decided to order his hus@@ band &apos;s t@@ ree cli@@ m@@ our , the hot month was the pa@@ edi@@ um in Vienna .
the cli@@ ent ordered at that time cost 4 000 kro@@ ons , a quarter of the price of a well @-@ established rural house .
the fact that some of the t@@ ree was suspected of having a champion &apos;s par@@ ac@@ hu@@ e with a mo@@ del@@ li was not intimi@@ dated by a sugar mag@@ na@@ te .
as far as A@@ fi@@ as is concerned , the only sure fact is that the close relationship between the mo@@ del@@ li and the ar@@ tist that has emerged during the work has continued throughout life .
Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;@@ Con@@ nor - &quot; Da@@ am gold .
Mr B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri &apos;s extraordinary story of the Climate C@@ up , &quot; Var@@ ra@@ k 2016 , which translated Al@@ do R@@ and@@ lands from English .
shortly before the work with A@@ dele@@ e began , the Climate was visited by Ra@@ ven@@ na San V@@ ita@@ le , and the investi@@ g@@ ators think that the bri@@ lli@@ ant mo@@ sa@@ ic mo@@ sa@@ ms that we have just seen there , from Im@@ o@@ dor@@ a , gave the ar@@ tist the idea of making a gol@@ den t@@ ree of A@@ dele@@ tion pa@@ ved as a mo@@ sa@@ ic .
the cli@@ ent , in his &quot; Da@@ ami gold , &quot; was presented in Vienna in 19@@ 68 and around the same time ( from 19@@ 07 to 19@@ 08 ) , another gol@@ den land was born in the &quot; S@@ ue . &quot;
the artistic his@@ tori@@ ans did not lose sight of the simil@@ arity of two women .
how is Hitler about nature ?
&quot; I think I owe him to remember my friend Climate to make his work publicly available , &quot; A@@ tel B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer wrote to the Director of the Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere M@@ use@@ um in February 19@@ 18 to M@@ use@@ um a few years after he left an ar@@ tist ( Climate died in February 19@@ 18 ) and wanted their family &apos;s Climate College to go to a muse@@ um .
six years on from the death penalty , the cli@@ ent had produced another t@@ ree .
in his wil@@ l@@ ness ( in February 19@@ 25 ) , he also asked her hus@@ band to leave her two por@@ ters and four G@@ ood Climate landsca@@ pes to Austrian Gal@@ er .
she inh@@ eri@@ ted her sis@@ ters to Mari@@ a and Lu@@ il .
one year after the Climate had finished the &apos; Austrian Mon@@ a Annex &apos; , an attempt had been made to get into the A@@ ca@@ de@@ mine of the Ka@@ th@@ mand@@ ar@@ ies of Vi@@ in , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Ad@@ ol@@ f Hitler , but failed in the drawing room .
even though Hitler &apos;s later anti @-@ S@@ emit@@ ism is sometimes considered to have not been accepted by Jewish profes@@ sors into the A@@ ca@@ de@@ my , none of his ex@@ ca@@ va@@ tors was actually Jews .
in any case , the Austrian Gal@@ er , which was referred to in Maria wil@@ ment , had become a significant task by 19@@ 39 , with the important task of finding ple@@ asing works for the Naz@@ is in Vienna from the rich Jewish arts .
Hitler &apos;s personal artistic wealth also served some work at home , but not that of the climate .
Si@@ x@@ ty years after the March of the Naz@@ is , a 10 @-@ year dispute between the Austrian Government and the he@@ irs of the B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer began .
it should only be noted here that , if the &apos; novel &apos; can be seen in the Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere Cas@@ tle in Vienna , A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ er &apos;s de@@ pic@@ tion of the &apos; Da@@ ami gold &apos; should be seen as travelling to New York in Ne@@ ue Gal@@ er .
and to read the abo@@ ve@@ mentioned book before Vienna .
even if you are not going to look at the work of the Climate , my emo@@ tions at least revol@@ ved around na@@ il and ha@@ ir rather than the 135 million @-@ dollar @-@ sold pain@@ ting and mo@@ ll A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer after the closure of the book .
so it is not so much a mar@@ ried t@@ ree , rather than a tri@@ bal t@@ reas@@ ure - and a very moving story .
the orientation of the events at the beginning of the book has greatly facilitated the relatives of the Bauer .
17 @-@ year @-@ old sw@@ im@@ ming in Canada was very close to the Estonian record
in life , the gold used to be 200 m of in@@ sec@@ tici@@ de very close to the personal record , sw@@ im@@ ming 2.@@ 2.@@ .@@ 62 .
the Ti@@ pp@@ mark dates from a 17 @-@ year @-@ old festi@@ val a week ago when the Canadian football Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ship won 2.@@ 16.@@ 58 , Pri@@ it A@@ av@@ ik &apos;s U@@ ju@@ mont .
the gold ended up perhaps in ten final zones A @-@ fin@@ als .
in the final h@@ all , he went through the distance of 2.@@ 15.@@ 76 and achieved a good seventh place with a new powerful March of excellence .
the Estonian record for A@@ lina K@@ end@@ zi@@ or ( 2.@@ 15.@@ 13 ) left the Gol@@ den for just over half a second .
the gold went up third in an all @-@ time ranking in Estonia , and its fresh personal peak is the fifth result ever in Estonia .
a young hope for the future lies in the launch of the Canadian adult Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ship with 100 m , 200 m and 400 m in wh@@ is@@ tle@@ blow@@ ing and 200 m@@ and 400 m in bun@@ dling .
last week in Tor@@ onto , the Canadian football Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ic Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ship took place and the gold started off there as well .
he won 200 m@@ ou@@ ths of sil@@ ver me@@ dal during 2.@@ 0@@ 3.@@ 22 .
it was so quickly sw@@ am@@ ped as an act of distance , most recently in 2008 .
only Estonia &apos;s record , E@@ lina Par@@ tar@@ ka , has distan@@ ced itself from the Gol@@ den range faster than ever .
as an Canadian pro@@ tag@@ on@@ ist , B@@ ron@@ ks@@ med@@ al is also won by a 100 m @-@ bal@@ last in a great personal record , with a new Estonian March of peak of 5@@ 6.@@ 66 .
for example , the year @-@ old Ker@@ tu ly Al@@ ne@@ k of her year @-@ old Ker@@ tu has moved away by just one century faster .
he reached a further 100 m in a sw@@ im@@ ming on his own top mark in an open exchange of known sw@@ im@@ ming time 1.@@ 0@@ 3.@@ 69 .
at a longer distance , it only gained its seventh seat when it dro@@ w@@ ned in the final assembly at 2.@@ 17.@@ 31 .
gold is currently in charge of four different ran@@ k@@ ings of the Estonian season .
President T@@ ru@@ mp goes on holiday , critics provide teet@@ h
the time for holidays has come - that also means a rela@@ xation for the US President Donald T@@ ru@@ ps .
however , since T@@ ru@@ mp has so far been the President who took the most holiday days , critics are already spar@@ king teet@@ h .
as announced by the US telecom and CN@@ N , a 17 @-@ day holiday is planned by the President at the un@@ spent traditional gol@@ f club B@@ ed@@ min@@ ster in New Jer@@ se@@ y .
although the President &apos;s leave began yesterday , anti @-@ T@@ ru@@ p leave has been spoken about for a week .
they are making too frequent calls for cle@@ ans@@ ing on the Olympic front .
indeed , the President has an un@@ spent week exchange time in his F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and New Jer@@ sey cotton .
incidentally , T@@ ru@@ mp has no longer had the cle@@ arest president in his 19@@ 6 terms of office .
for example , George W@@ . Bush had already reached 67 days on holiday with Barack Obama less than half the T@@ ru@@ mp but 21 days .
on the other hand , the Olympic Games are ten@@ ding to forget things quickly .
a few days after becoming President , T@@ ru@@ mp &apos;s programme called &apos; 60 minutes &apos; said that there would be no time for long holidays for his pro@@ po@@ ser , because there is a great deal to be done .
he also expressed his outra@@ ge at Barack Obama &apos;s leave three years ago .
the current President wrote on Twitter at the time : &apos; while Obama is on holiday , gol@@ f , sole@@ mn and j@@ uni@@ or groups are playing on their sole@@ mn lines , they cut their heads off their thro@@ ats &apos; .
a 17 @-@ day gol@@ f club visit does not have any rela@@ xation at all , according to officials of the White House .
instead , it is officially called employment leave , during which the Olympic Games have no time to read or to engage in any other kind of activity .
in addition , leave had to be for another reason .
namely , the western system of the White House is being replaced and the entire staff therefore had to leave it .
the West wing also ho@@ sts the O@@ val@@ ric@@ ane and other presidential offices .
&quot; I do not think any of you would like to be in the West in August if there were 38 degrees and no office pension for the White House , &quot; said L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters , the spokes@@ person for the White House , who stressed that the President would continue to work on holiday .
where President T@@ ru@@ mp will spend 17 days next , you will get some idea of a video .
blocking critics on Facebook : do not apply for national office unless you tolerate voters &apos; criticism
our country &apos;s father knew a great deal about unfavourable media coverage .
the Americans lo@@ ved George Washington , but the newspapers did not go so long as to start ha@@ un@@ ting him for everything , from internal politics to political principles .
he was , of course , anno@@ yed by the criticism .
but he did not make his critics remain silent .
because , in 17@@ 83 , Washington said that &apos; freedom of expression can be taken away from us and , lou@@ dly and qui@@ et@@ ly , we may be driven to slaugh@@ ter@@ houses like sheep &apos; .
that brings me to Mar@@ y@@ land &apos;s govern@@ or , Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who is struggling to be more Washington @-@ like .
it has blocked and deleted at least 450 pos@@ ters who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page .
and later this week , he was therefore taken to court by the American Civil Liberties Union ( Civil Liberties Union ) .
the govern@@ or of the Governor &apos;s office pic@@ ked the action empty and web commen@@ ta@@ tes were ri@@ d@@ dled with counter @-@ reactions in the style of &apos; who would be interested ? &apos;
&apos;@@ Th@@ at is just Facebook , &apos; many said .
but that is what matters .
and that is particularly important when it comes to a man like Ho@@ gan .
it is an aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular Re@@ publi@@ can govern@@ or in an overwhel@@ mingly democratic state .
his discharge percentage is the second highest among the 50 govern@@ ors in the country .
it is not an un@@ thin@@ kable wh@@ i@@ p .
he has sta@@ yed firmly in the hands of the state and has stood firm on his principles .
in addition , he has used Facebook as the main tool for communicating with his constituents quite deliberately , for example , by putting his head on the ro@@ of for the first time after a che@@ mis@@ try .
thus , the govern@@ or &apos;s co@@ ws are a public forum with official marking , managed by the blocking and ultimately dangerous blocking of people who are going to visit people who are paid by taxpayers on dollars .
in an interview with The Washington Posselt , the spokes@@ person of the Ho@@ gan press , defended the behaviour of the govern@@ or , claiming that blocking comments was nothing more than moder@@ ation .
but it is all too easy to pa@@ int a picture of online sur@@ ger@@ y , spa@@ m@@ mers , or a nation full of anger .
the post spoke to a number of quite people whose Ho@@ gan was blocked .
that is precisely what they are about , in contact with their chosen leaders : the teacher , the company &apos;s owner and passport holder , and not Internet controls .
they all said that their comments were respec@@ table , well thought @-@ out and not black .
Pas@@ tor quoted the Bi@@ ble in his post , op@@ pressing the Ho@@ gan Catholic movement .
a lawyer from Bo@@ wi@@ e , L@@ ak@@ sh@@ m Sar@@ ma Ra@@ man , did not inci@@ te hatred but rather hate crimes .
&quot; I made a poli@@ te comment that I am disappointed because he has not responded to hate crime or other recent news , &quot; he wrote in the heading of the news story of The mail .
&quot; nor do I like the idea that if many people comment on the same subject some call it an in@@ difference to a collective effort rather than admit that they are a great many concerned citizens . &quot;
what the govern@@ or of the govern@@ or called a &apos; targeted spa@@ m attack &apos; would probably be sum@@ mon@@ ed by others into &apos; public support &apos; .
the Facebook era can easily reconcile messages by simply blocking criticism or dele@@ ting negative comments .
it is much cleaner than it used to be when , in order to do the same , the workers had to be depor@@ ted so that they could gather and bur@@ n the newspapers with critical edit@@ orial letters , or arrest the protest@@ ors and make them remain silent .
but that is exactly what is happening now , simply in digital terms .
the Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to be criticised for making Facebook and other social media too@@ th@@ less .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i has taken Twitter users to court and has been blocked from Twitter &apos;s stream .
last week in Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , one of the first land@@ mark judgments on this subject .
in C@@ ac@@ her@@ is , US Dis@@ tri@@ ct Judge James C. Alexand@@ ria decided that the Cha@@ ir@@ woman of the Coun@@ ty Board of supervisors of Lou@@ d@@ oun@@ i broke the first amendment of the constitution when he blocked the constitu@@ ent on his Facebook page .
in K@@ enn@@ tu@@ ck@@ ys , as well as the use of AC@@ L@@ U Facebook and Twitter , Governor Mat@@ t B@@ ev@@ in ( R ) visited .
it should not be so difficult .
during Washington , affordable postal costs had a similar effect to the Internet .
between 17@@ 76 and 18@@ 00 , the number of newspapers and anon@@ ymous wri@@ ters da@@ m@@ ned in his way of leadership .
even then , Washington had to deal with anon@@ ymous controls .
people wrote letters to newspapers with pseu@@ do @-@ on@@ y@@ ms such as Ju@@ ric@@ ol@@ a , Val@@ eri@@ us , Bel@@ is@@ ari@@ us and Por@@ ti@@ us , bet@@ ra@@ ying Washington &apos;s decisions .
on the basis of historical documents collected by George Washington &apos;s web @-@ based project to collect letters , he bur@@ ned a c@@ abinet under petitions criticising his views on the friendship , trade and shipping agreements with Britain .
however , he did not force them to remain silent .
freedom of expression , dis@@ sent and debate are the foundations of our country .
and proper management means accepting it .

the Northern I@@ ris@@ h@@ man , who was in the vic@@ inity of Ar@@ cher@@ field L@@ ink &apos;s run@@ ners last year on the eve of the last round before Paul E@@ al@@ ous@@ ting , is attached to the new scene and is playing the role of Ambassador of the club foun@@ der and CE@@ O , Jer@@ ry S@@ ole@@ di , as opposed to his seat .
&quot; I saw the R@@ ena@@ iss@@ ance C@@ lu@@ b being built , and we are now seeing a club s@@ tun@@ ning the full b@@ reat@@ h of the event , &quot; said R@@ aff@@ er@@ ty .
&quot; players see the path in the best possible form , it is in a bri@@ lli@@ ant state .
Jer@@ ry has done an excellent job in establishing this place .
he is a keen supporter of the gol@@ f game and proud of what he has achieved here .
it is an excellent opportunity to present the path . &quot;
an Eng@@ lis@@ h@@ man will ever be eag@@ er to defend the title for the first time , despite the fact that he has won both European Toubon and the European challenge Tou@@ l during his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; it is a very special feeling , &quot; said the be@@ ating player in Sou@@ th@@ por@@ t .
&quot; I could not defend my Ex@@ t@@ rema@@ du@@ ra O@@ pen title because it was taken down the competition calendar one year after my victory .
it is bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re to come back to this chic@@ ken .
this is an excellent place to play at gol@@ f .
I remember the memor@@ ies of last year , for me and for my wife Shar@@ on , last year &apos;s victory was a special one .
it was a very special time , and one that we will always bear in our hearts . &quot;
G@@ ary Or@@ r will also return to the competition on home soil , who joined the European model of se@@ gen@@ i@@ uses earlier this year , when he received 50 .
this is his first event in Scotland since the participation of A@@ ber@@ de@@ en asset Management Scottish O@@ pen@@ il in 2013 .
&quot; to play at home is always a little more meaningful , &quot; said Hel@@ en@@ s@@ bur@@ gh &apos;s man Or@@ r .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at well to speak , but you also know the extra .
I have enjoyed playing again tre@@ men@@ do@@ usly and I have shown quite a proper gol@@ f game .
I am satisfied with the progress that has been made . &quot;
ian W@@ oo@@ s@@ na@@ m and Paul Brok , Ro@@ ger Chap@@ man , mark James and mark Mc@@ N@@ ul@@ ty will join Tri@@ o in the square .
Or@@ r and former Ry@@ der car@@ ika Cap@@ tain S@@ am Tor@@ om are two out of six Scottish con@@ tests , the rest being Andrew O@@ ld@@ cor@@ n , Ste@@ p@@ hen Mc@@ Allis@@ ter , bill L@@ ong@@ mu@@ ir and ross D@@ ru@@ mon@@ d .
entry is free of charge and car par@@ king costs a passenger GBP 5 and a car with two or more passengers GBP 10 .
all revenues will go to Pro@@ state Can@@ er UK , a ch@@ ari@@ table organisation .
poverty and death on Indonesia &apos;s gold @-@ rich land
when Mr De@@ ge@@ i &apos;s dinner is produced , he does not use lead .
he even sel@@ dom uses a bo@@ y .
Indonesia &apos;s tar in a house house in the capital of Papua P@@ ani@@ a@@ i P@@ ani@@ a@@ c P@@ ani@@ a@@ c Coun@@ ty will place a bar called the ho@@ use@@ wife in the local language directly in place of fire .
in half an hour &apos;s time , a b@@ reat@@ h will be taken from the fire in a d@@ run@@ ken slu@@ dge and s@@ kin@@ ned with un@@ sca@@ ff@@ ed hands .
the De@@ ge@@ i is sitting on the other floor floor of the ro@@ ck it does not have interoperability and , at the same time , it is doing its day @-@ to @-@ day ho@@ use@@ work there , such as was@@ hing the was@@ hing water from ne@@ ar@@ by gender .

Pol@@ y@@ ga@@ a@@ mia is common@@ place here on May .
however , the majority of men in this village may be at risk of being unemployed and many run heavily , plus soldiers .
&apos;@@ nobody da@@ res to go around after 5 o &apos;@@ clock in the village , &apos; says .
this is a rare specta@@ cle in Papua mountain , a former Dutch col@@ ony that was added to Indonesia in 19@@ 69 after a referendum which caused controversy , forcing only 1 0@@ 26 old people to vote their hands in front of the troops .
the movement from the upper hand of the Dutch people towards their outra@@ ge against the Y@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta Government , which continues to keep the region under strong control , keeping away foreign journalists and human rights supervisors .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into a P@@ ope and a Western P@@ ope , so that independent Papua New Guinea remained in the east of the island .
in order to get here , the majority is equally distant and de@@ ser@@ ted , from the capital of the province of Ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ur@@ a , to fly 90 minutes of N@@ abi@@ n and then pass a five @-@ hour journey making the ren@@ tal car na@@ vel .
there is no public transport .
a city with around 19 000 inhabitants is made up of t@@ ree houses surrounded by b@@ read@@ cru@@ mb@@ s and covers ru@@ min@@ ant iron ro@@ of@@ s , which have been turned into a different tone into y@@ el@@ low lig@@ ni@@ te .
very few indicators have taken the route here , not to mention the journalists , and almost no foreigners have been here either .
before the Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago &apos;s boats mar@@ ched God with the name of ga T@@ ame@@ e .
other changes also took place .
&apos;@@ We were not ac@@ custo@@ med to we@@ aring such clo@@ thes &apos; says De@@ ge@@ i , referring to a co@@ ded tur@@ f of our pa@@ int ro@@ tation , dark plu@@ ral and private dig@@ es@@ tive .
&apos;@@ prior to that , we were we@@ aring only plant co@@ ws in the body &apos; .
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line , and the statistics on inf@@ ant mortality and il@@ literacy are among the worst in Asia .
however , it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold @-@ rich land .
just 100 km from P@@ ani@@ a@@ o , a mountain province of around 153 000 inhabitants in New Jer@@ sey , the world &apos;s largest and most lu@@ cra@@ tive gold mine , G@@ ras@@ berg , which belongs to F@@ Friday Mc@@ Mor@@ an , a company based in P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x .
in 2015 alone , F@@ Friday exports from here extra@@ cted around USD 3.@@ 1 billion worth of gold and cop@@ per .
in addition , Papua can bo@@ ast of consumer timber stocks worth an estimated USD 78 billion .
however , these ri@@ ches are the source of the suffering of the boats as they cause the suff@@ oc@@ ating presence of a powerful Indonesia &apos;s army .
the New York Times study in 2005 showed that between 1998 and 2004 , F@@ Friday &apos;s report paid approximately USD 20 million to local troops and military units , including up to USD 150 000 to one of the officers .
P@@ ope &apos;s efforts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this gol@@ den h@@ all and are handled ru@@ th@@ lessly .
according to human rights activists , more than 500 000 boats have been killed since 19@@ 69 and thousands more have been ra@@ ped , tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesia army .
according to the Asian Human Rights Commission , in the 1970s , the mass killing of genocide in the moun@@ tains belonging to Papua tri@@ be was a symp@@ tom .
last year alone , over 3 900 peaceful protest@@ ors were arrested by the Indonesia police in the area .
the 2016 B@@ ish@@ ops &apos; report &apos; We shall all lose &apos; contains testi@@ mony to the atrocities committed last year , such as extra@@ judicial executions , torture ( according to another report , rape and electric shock are particularly common ) and the brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; the number of victims is difficult to count because such incidents occur every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , one of Indonesia &apos;s investi@@ g@@ ators of Human Rights Watch .
they have been closed even more strongly , as Papua natural resources have caused the influx of new set@@ tle@@ rs from elsewhere in Indonesia .
83 % of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians , but demo@@ graph@@ ics are changing , with Muslim economic migrants arriving on the islands of Jaa@@ va , Kal@@ im@@ an@@ tan , Su@@ ma@@ tra and S@@ ula@@ w@@ es in Indonesia .
direct pe@@ as@@ ants are selling ga@@ do @-@ ga@@ do @-@ ga@@ do vegetables with bal@@ con@@ y and mixed vegetables , which are served along with pe@@ anu@@ ts .
local communities cannot compete with them .
&quot; migrants started selling chic@@ k@@ ens and vegetables more cheap@@ ly than local cre@@ ws on the traditional market , &quot; explain the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Lynne born in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , who moved to Ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ur@@ i , the province &apos;s capital for work .
&quot; Black sc@@ oo@@ den cre@@ ws Papua ma@@ ma @-@ ma@@ ma &#91; Women &#93; connect to lose their market share . &quot;
the President of Indonesia , J@@ ok@@ o W@@ id@@ o@@ do , known as Jo@@ ko@@ w among the people , pledged in his 2014 election campaign to address these inequalities and human rights violations in P@@ ope .
the former pu@@ mp won 27 constitu@@ encies , including P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , on his way to the presidential Pal@@ ace of J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta in Papua 29 .
but the P@@ ope has changed very little and the local people feel dece@@ ived .
&quot; our hearts have been broken because in 2014 , we voted for Jo@@ ko@@ w in the expectation that he would live up to our hopes of a return to justice , &quot; says &apos; You will .
in fact , only two months after Jo@@ ko@@ w took office in October , P@@ ani@@ a@@ i was in a low state .
on 7 December 2014 , 11 children in the majority of the world sta@@ ged on Christmas when two Moroccan soldiers appeared on a motor@@ cycle out of their dar@@ k@@ ness .
they were told by gri@@ ev@@ ed children that they should include the front lights .
according to what the local pas@@ tor@@ i Y@@ a@@ ve@@ dt T@@ han@@ i said , one of the soldiers insul@@ ted their tone and subsequently returned with four soldiers .
according to the victims and specta@@ tors , d@@ run@@ k soldiers hun@@ ted behind their children and dece@@ ive them with their gun@@ s .
one soldi@@ er then shot among children .
one child , Y@@ u@@ li@@ an@@ us Ye@@ im@@ o , aged 16 , was beaten so coura@@ ge@@ ously that he fell into the Chamber .
a few hours later , the ne@@ ar@@ by electoral Commission building was set on fire , and the next day things es@@ c@@ ala@@ ted even more .
around 1 000 young men , women and children gathered in a football pit@@ ch in front of a local police station and a military command centre in order to demand justice .
they we@@ ed white buses for repa@@ irs and presented Papua me@@ e pa@@ go tri@@ be for wa@@ ita @-@ tan@@ ker , during which a round was run and a s@@ ong of poultry was bu@@ ried .
some prote@@ sters started to wh@@ ite@@ was@@ h on the police and the military .
on the f@@ all@@ out of anger , an order was sent to the soldiers via an internal sta@@ di@@ um : &apos; when a crow@@ d is more than three times resis@@ ting , let them down , &apos; was stated in an official document , which has been seen by the magaz@@ ine on time but has not been issued to local media publications .
older Ye@@ re@@ mi@@ as Ka@@ y@@ am ( 56 ) , in the town of Ke@@ go Ko@@ to , the city of the majority , felt threatened and called for peace to be maintained by asking for the population to go home .
no one had the will to listen .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen I was suddenly shot in the left , &apos; said to the magaz@@ ine in his private b@@ read@@ cru@@ mb@@ s on the shel@@ f of the t@@ ree .
we still do not know who the fir@@ mer was , but say that the month came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered .
&apos;@@ There was a lot of people , there were plenty of las@@ ts in the industry , &apos; he adds .
Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w , a local man , has seen him shot down three times .
&apos;@@ L@@ et me come to him and look through his body to make sure that it is with him , &apos; said the magaz@@ ine at length in Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who , like many other indicators , use only one name .
&apos;@@ I saw that he has died ... I visited him &apos; .
the chief inspe@@ ctor of Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ aks , told the repor@@ ters that he only guaranteed the security of his department because it was attacked .
&apos;@@ We must defend ourselves when we are threatened with killing &apos; said P@@ ud@@ jo S@@ ul@@ is@@ ti@@ yo , Commissioner for Police S@@ ul@@ is@@ ti@@ yo in 2015 .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at is a matter of life and death &apos; .
according to Human Rights Watch , five young protest@@ ors were killed and many injured .
the news of the killings only reached J@@ ak@@ ary the next day .
three weeks later , Jo@@ ko@@ w Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ ra made an im@@ passion@@ ed speech in which he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and allowed abuses that took place in P@@ ope to be dealt with .
&quot; I want to resolve this case straight away so that it will never happen again in the future , &quot; he said .
Mr W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , Minister for Security , said in October 2016 that he would put in place an alternative mechanism for the resolution of crimes against human rights .
but the ex@@ cus@@ es almost immediately followed .
&quot; most crimes happened a long time ago .
some took place in the 1990s and early 200@@ 0s .
the point is that we are committed to resolving these crimes , but we have to follow certain processes , &apos; he said .
however , speaking in J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta on 5 June , W@@ ir@@ an@@ to took his words back , saying that he had no intention of creating a P@@ ope mechanism to deal with complaints .
instead , he said , &apos; everything is done according to the law &apos; .
W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , who has been indi@@ cted by the UN for crimes against human rights by more than 1 000 people in East Timor during the bloody referendum on independence in 1999 , said that 11 crimes against human rights had already been resolved in P@@ ope , including in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
the families of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i victims accepted such claims with g@@ loom@@ y mistrust .
&quot; I have been inter@@ ro@@ gated four times over the last three years but no progress has been made , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&apos;@@ I am ti@@ red &apos; .
he says that years later , he still lives in fear .
&apos;@@ I am afraid , &apos; he says .
&apos;@@ I am afraid the army is ar@@ resting me , I am afraid I am being shot &apos; .
his bro@@ ther Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us confirmed the view that the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i people are fe@@ ar@@ ful of this ep@@ iso@@ de .
he said that he had been beaten by the army after helping to bur@@ y the four victims .
&apos;@@ Fol@@ low@@ ing the bu@@ ried bodies , the army had to look for me , &apos; he says .
arrests have not ce@@ ased .
on Tuesday in D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ is , the people of Indonesia &apos;s village district of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i were shot in a neighbouring regener@@ ation .
one person was killed and 17 w@@ ounded , including children , when it went to war between the head of the village population and the head of the construction company , who refused to transport an un@@ conscious man to hospital .
this man , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ iku@@ an@@ us D@@ ou@@ w , who dro@@ w@@ ned into a ne@@ ar@@ by river seeking fish , died on his way to hospital .
blind village inhabitants prote@@ sted at a construction site in front of the company &apos;s office .
according to the police , village people st@@ oned poli@@ ce@@ men and the latter responded by means of aler@@ ts .
however , according to local claims , a mobile bri@@ gade ( a mili@@ tant police driven by Indonesia ) started fir@@ ing at the people , killing one person .
&apos;@@ We were in great s@@ care@@ mon@@ gering , we are afraid of re@@ pris@@ als , &apos; said the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ ge Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near a hospital and saw those injured in@@ duc@@ ed .
&apos;@@ I have beaten myself in my own house for two days &apos; .
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ i Parliament has called for the police involved to be held accountable and for the police to be withdrawn from the region by the mobile bri@@ gade .
P@@ ani@@ a@@ i has always been a problem for the Government of Indonesia .
the absence of any meaningful development fe@@ eds the dis@@ satisfaction of the honey , m@@ one , dan@@ g@@ on and Sudanese tri@@ bes living in Papua hal@@ i@@ um .
many of them have joined an army of free Papua ar@@ k ( V@@ PL ) re@@ bels which , according to its own words , protects the rights of boats by appalling assa@@ ul@@ ts and kid@@ napp@@ ings on the part of Indonesia &apos;s soldiers .
some V@@ PL leaders come from P@@ ani@@ a@@ o , including Ta@@ di@@ us Y@@ o@@ g and Daniel Y@@ u@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response , the army has been ar@@ resting in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i over recent years and arbitrarily ar@@ resting thousands of people on the pretext of &apos; defending state sovereignty &apos; .
some of them will never appear again .
P@@ ani@@ a@@ des are known as &apos; a tragic forgotten place &apos; among Papua people .
poverty fe@@ eds dis@@ satisfaction .
the small ri@@ ce that is sold in the majority of the whe@@ el is too expensive to buy at local level .
I find the same un@@ at@@ tain@@ able .
people themselves culti@@ vate all their food online as a basic b@@ read@@ cru@@ mb@@ s , as well as some fruit and lea@@ ther vegetables .
farming is a job for women , each of whom can care for four or five ba@@ seline fields .
they usually keep most of the harves@@ ts in the family , the rest being sold on the local market .
only 10 bases cost 10 000 Indonesia &apos;s premises ( 75 cents ) .
over time , economic inequalities have wid@@ ened between underground boats and new migrants , who have come a great deal since the opening of new routes at N@@ ab@@ ire Air@@ port .
the few jobs that exist go better to more well @-@ educated and richer migrants .
the P@@ ope himself often lacks the capital or the necessary skills to conduct a competitive business .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village because there are no jobs or money here , &quot; says John Go@@ ba@@ i , President of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i tri@@ be Council .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from the P@@ ope .
in addition , strict restrictions remain on foreign media .
earlier this year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le L@@ ong@@ cha@@ mp were expelled from P@@ ope because &apos; they did not follow the relevant practices &apos; had been granted a rare film authorisation .
the election promises made by Jo@@ ko@@ w , Vice @-@ President of the Asian department of Human Rights Watch , to remove the restrictions on reports to promote transparency and development have not been implemented .
&apos;@@ In Indonesia , journalists trying to report in Papua most eastern provinces and Western P@@ ope , are threatened with new threats of rejection and black@@ listing , &apos; he said in his statement .
the lack of a look at the press means that the international pressure on the government of Indonesia is largely limited to Papua i &apos;s immediate neighbours .
in March , six of the Pacific States pushed the Pacific Ocean countries to explore the &apos; United Nations Human Rights Council - crimes on a broad scale &apos; , including the shooting of P@@ ani@@ a@@ o , Na@@ ur@@ u , B@@ ela@@ u , Tu@@ pain , the Mar@@ shall Islands and the Sol@@ om@@ on Islands .
these same countries have also historically supported V@@ PL .
Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , spokes@@ man of the Indonesia Ministry of Foreign Affairs , dismissed the group &apos;s accusations , saying to the press in J@@ ak@@ ar@@ tas : &apos; democratic order still exists in Indonesia and freedom of the press , so that evidence of human rights cases would be hard to bur@@ y &apos; .
the local people want more foreign governments to be taken on board .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the country &apos;s human rights Envoy , Mr Van B@@ ar , visited Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ ra on 4 May , the local people interrupted their silence , according to the source of their desire to remain anon@@ ymous , urging &apos; we want freedom &apos; .
in Indonesia , new presidential elections will be held in 2019 , but boats do not believe they will vote for Jo@@ ko@@ w again .
&quot; Jo@@ ko@@ w is a well @-@ inten@@ tioned man , but he is surrounded by people linked to the shooting of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , &quot; says Ho@@ ba@@ i , President of the tri@@ bal Council .
he wants to tell Jo@@ ko@@ w that not only do the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i live under the threat of a constantly pre@@ da@@ tory army , but they are struggling with misery due to poor education and health services .
according to Go@@ ba@@ i , the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , like other boats , regard their vote to Jo@@ ko@@ w as their debt to be paid .
&apos;@@ The@@ y do not need money , they want justice , &apos; he says .
despite threats and intimidation , the families of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i bom@@ b@@ ers managed the last to@@ ken revol@@ t of insur@@ gency , swe@@ pt away one of the victims &apos; bodies , and the military bases responded to the land they had .
knowing that justice may never be put on its feet , at least they will not allow those responsible to forget their crimes .
&apos;@@ One of our family members has been killed , &apos; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a be@@ sie@@ ged head .
&apos;@@ What else can we do ? &apos;
come in for the second time under Du@@ ba@@ i Tor@@ ch photo@@ graph@@ er
on Friday , hundreds of inhabitants of this 3@@ 37 metres de@@ ser@@ t and escape from the 79 ti@@ dal buildings were fed through one of the world &apos;s highest residential tow@@ ers in Du@@ ba@@ i .
this is another fire that has ra@@ va@@ ged the High Representative for just two years , which , incidentally , is called Tu@@ rin , or T@@ har@@ vi@@ ku@@ p .
none of the injuries were reported and no direct fire occurred .
&quot; we s@@ le@@ ep and wo@@ ke up with fires and people sh@@ ou@@ ting .
we would be travelling down the sta@@ irs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &apos; said Re@@ u@@ ters a resident who called himself George .
according to Du@@ ba@@ i civil protection officials , the fire @-@ fighters also deleted the site at around 4 o &apos;@@ clock in the morning at local time ( 00@@ .00 G@@ MT ) and ref@@ ra@@ ined the building .
the government said that it was working to provide shelter to those affected .
this ep@@ iso@@ de may once again raise questions about the safety of high @-@ cal@@ ib@@ re materials used across the world .
an investigation carried out in the wake of the 2015 Tu@@ ch Management Board into the fire found that the most damage was caused by the fa@@ ç@@ a@@ des , the off @-@ shore dec@@ or@@ atory panels and isolation .
the British police have said that they believe that the isolation of the London G@@ ren@@ er T@@ ow@@ er and the fa@@ ç@@ er panels could contribute to the rapid spread of the fire that went on there in June , killing around 80 people .
see : such phones are expected to become sales sites in the autumn
complex and autumn is the time for technical Afgh@@ ans to display their new models of excellence .
in the spring , Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , Hu@@ aw@@ ei P@@ 10 and S@@ ony X@@ peri@@ a Pre@@ mi@@ um came for sale , and in the autumn too new h@@ it@@ t @-@ phones are expected for boys .
&quot; thanks to telecoms 2 marketing and sale Director , CS@@ jan Se@@ mother , this year &apos;s flag@@ ships are characterised by an innovative design , an eye @-@ h@@ all , a screen with a 4@@ K resolution on the ser@@ ver @-@ servan@@ i , and a super @-@ fast process manager .
Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 gave rise to a great deal of ex@@ ci@@ tement in the technological world , which has also reached the top of the sale table for smar@@ t@@ phones in Estonia .
the autumn will allow even more stra@@ ined re@@ charging , more resilient bat@@ tery , better quality camer@@ as and greater water and pollin@@ ation for smart citizens .
he added that the rum@@ ours could already specu@@ late and predict four models of excellence that will probably con@@ qu@@ er streets .
these four &quot; smart phone top &quot; models will end up on super@@ market shel@@ ves later this autumn .
the long @-@ awaited i@@ P@@ hone 8 and i@@ P@@ hone 8 Plus should reach the shops as early as mid @-@ September .
however , rum@@ ours of what the new Apple model looks like and what can be done about it are spreading greatly .
while the i@@ P@@ hone 7 did not bring significant differences between i@@ P@@ hone 6@@ s , on the occasion of the tenth birth@@ day of Apple , it is expected that the new model will be completely different from previous ones .
four col@@ ours have been mentioned : black , white , rosé gold and ch@@ ro@@ mi@@ um .
one of the elements of the new design is probably the screen , which covers the entire telephone head@@ way , has lost the dog and the finger@@ print read@@ ers have been built on the screen .
J@@ on@@ y@@ I@@ ve , the head of design of Apple , demands that the new i@@ P@@ hone model look like a glass .
there has also been talk of an i@@ P@@ hone cer@@ a@@ mic version .
in addition to the no@@ vel@@ s of the G@@ V , un@@ man@@ age@@ able re@@ charging and an even better quality camer@@ a , a faster A@@ 11 process can be expected .
this is certainly one of the year &apos;s anticipated smar@@ t@@ phones .
on 23 August , the preliminary order of the brand new model G@@ ala@@ x@@ y rou@@ 8 begins .
there have been many rum@@ ours about what the new G@@ ala@@ x@@ y rou@@ 8 will look like .
Ad@@ mittedly , even more business users have been targeted and the S pen allows for even greater fun@@ ction@@ ality .
there should be two camer@@ as on the phone , one being a la@@ isse@@ z @-@ j@@ er@@ k and the other an object of television with a narro@@ wer view .
no one yet knows what the two tab@@ oo@@ s are capable of , but in any case this is Sam@@ sun@@ g &apos;s first test , which is certainly comparable in terms of quality to the i@@ P@@ hone 8 .
we are , however , eag@@ er@@ ly awaiting 23 August .
although Nokia has put three smar@@ t@@ phones on sale this year , headed by Nokia 6 , there is still a shortage of their flag@@ ships , Nokia 8 , which are already to be presented on 16 August .
we expect a screen running from No@@ ki@@ a to 5.@@ 3 p.m. and an ultra @-@ fast Qu@@ al@@ com@@ m S@@ kar@@ dra@@ g@@ on 8@@ 35 pro@@ cess@@ or and a more durable bat@@ tery .
Nokia also talks about alu@@ mini@@ um cor@@ ps and significant levels of water and pollin@@ ation in IP@@ 68 .
like Sam@@ su@@ ng@@ i , the new model of Nokia has two tab@@ oo@@ s , an opti@@ mist produced by Z@@ e@@ iss .
if S@@ ony @-@ certain flag@@ ships have been X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um to date , the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smart phones with even more innovative features will soon be included .
we are waiting for a smar@@ t@@ phone that is slightly more modest than X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um , but at least just as good or better as a camer@@ a .
for the new model of S@@ ony , there has been speculation that its screen is at least cu@@ mber@@ some .
what reality will bring us to see very soon , as S@@ ony has traditionally made its autumn flag@@ ships public at the IF@@ A International Technology F@@ air , which will take place this year from 1 to 6 September .
T@@ ru@@ mp Mexico was pres@@ su@@ ris@@ ed to pay for the border wall , according to the trans@@ cri@@ p@@ tors who le@@ ak@@ ed telephone calls .
the Washington post unve@@ iled trans@@ cri@@ ptions of telephone calls between US President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i and Mexic@@ an and Austr@@ alian heads of state .
on 27 January , T@@ ru@@ mp &apos;s telep@@ hon@@ y to Mexic@@ an President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ et@@ o called on him to stop pro@@ claiming that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall .
he was crus@@ hed by the American President for publicly condemning the Wall by saying , &apos; You must not say this to the press &apos; .
T@@ ru@@ mp raised his presidential campaign &apos;s promise to build a along the southern border with the United States of America &apos;s wall and age to make Mexico pay for this project .
it also published trans@@ cri@@ ptions of his first speech with the Austr@@ alian Prime Minister , Malcolm Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l , which reveal a ten@@ se debate .
T@@ ru@@ mp told the Tur@@ une@@ as@@ y that the agreement by the United States of America to take in refugees to Australia was &apos; lu@@ dic@@ rous &apos; , &apos; ner@@ v@@ ous &apos; and &apos; stu@@ pid &apos; ; he said that the agreement made under the Obama Government would give him the impression of a &apos; guide &apos; as he has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States .
the T@@ ru@@ mp cut off by telling the Tur@@ ner that &apos; it was the day &apos;s most un@@ pleasant speech &apos; .
the National Court did not prosecute the city of Li@@ ines , the town of O@@ C MR@@ P , for having rejected their offer for bus and coach transport between July 2019 and 20@@ 29 .

although many in the social media complain that their night is distur@@ bed by the We@@ ek@@ end festi@@ val and the whole city is full of d@@ run@@ k brak@@ es , there are also many who do not have a single bad say on the ongoing festi@@ val on the floor .
I am even positively surprised that the super@@ market had such a cour@@ tes@@ y !
I did not see any mis@@ gi@@ vings or mis@@ cour@@ tes@@ y .
even out of generosity , I saw a huge wave of words .
&apos;@@ Wel@@ l , it &apos;s all very well to have come , to be and to be happy with Per@@ sian - a farm like the w@@ ag@@ ons - &apos; , he will be happy to add .
the th@@ or@@ ny wave of rub@@ b@@ ish does not b@@ other .
while he still heard in a central town that music would be played on the be@@ ach , music has not yet reached his home inten@@ tional level .
&quot; but I hope I hear , he says che@@ er@@ fully .
also , in Ag@@ nes , who talked about the A@@ ca@@ de@@ my , the Grand F@@ esti@@ val is more of a good thing for Per@@ sian - it makes a significant contribution to the turnover of local merchan@@ ts .
in addition , he welcomes the fact that the village has come to such an extent by the summer capital .
the pregnant woman has no problem .
even though I am no longer on the be@@ ach , it is nice that the rand has revi@@ ved .
and it &apos;s good that the people are moving , and that has been the case three times now &apos; , a woman says .
I think the first time was perhaps a little worse .
&apos;@@ Wel@@ l , maybe there were complaints &apos; , he is wondering .
he said that what happens on the be@@ ach was normal for the summer capital cities .
&apos;@@ This We@@ ek@@ end is a very good pro@@ mo for our small city , &apos; speaks of Har@@ r on board .
neither life nor the m@@ ö@@ ll has s@@ tun@@ ned his life y@@ el@@ low .
but for you ?
we should all econ@@ o@@ mise .
give some thought to how this inter @-@ ethnic communication would be better .
the ar@@ tist does not sha@@ ke the wh@@ ist@@ le .
it does not work , even though I live near it .
&apos;@@ G@@ ood people can make savings and there is no mis@@ fortune &apos; , he speaks .
gu@@ es@@ ts who have arrived in Per@@ sian are poli@@ te , as he said .
&quot; with bot@@ tles , of course , they are a little ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating , but young people are a young man and a man &apos;s God - give you to go , but be people and do it ! &apos; he says .
the people on the coast have travelled somewhere by then , whether with relatives or with acqu@@ ain@@ tan@@ ces .
&quot; but in general , the festi@@ val has a positive impact on life - people like this me@@ al , &quot; Ti@@ ina , who speaks to children .
his family &apos;s und festi@@ val does not b@@ other either , even though last year it did not go even further than it was today .
last summer there was another stage , then we heard more .
we live out of the city itself that it is actually a long way off the coast of the Per@@ sian River , &quot; he talks .
Pe@@ ar@@ son cuts another 3 000 jobs and reduces dividen@@ ds to revita@@ lise business
the British education company Pe@@ ar@@ son said on Friday that it would cut another 3 000 jobs and reduce its intermediate dividen@@ ds by 72 % , thereby launching another restructuring programme to deal with the threat to business .
in all prob@@ ability , according to the CE@@ O , John F@@ all@@ on , at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , will add 4 000 posts lost during the previous restructuring .
Pe@@ ar@@ son announced in May plans to cut costs by a further GBP 300 million ( USD 3@@ 94 million ) under the third expenditure reduction programme to try to revive a business that has been hit by the transition to rapid digital learning .
the company , which agreed to sell last month to its partner company Pen@@ gu@@ in R@@ and@@ om House , Ber@@ tel@@ s@@ mann , said that their expectation of a year has not changed since a 1 % increase in sales profits was announced in the first half of the year to GBP 2.@@ 05 billion .
on Sunday the summer of the ra@@ in@@ y season continues with a da@@ m@@ pen@@ ny
on Sunday , in Estonia , there will be a sun@@ screen window window window window with ra@@ in@@ y win@@ ds , and there will be some very strong out@@ breaks .
night in Estonia comes a weather with explanations in the cloud .
there are tor@@ ren@@ tial ra@@ inf@@ all on several sides , perhaps from the f@@ ring@@ es .
there is an outbreak of up to 14 , islands and coast@@ lines of up to 18 m in the south @-@ west and the west from 5 to 11 .
the temperature is between 13 and 17 degrees .
the day will come with a different picture weather .
there are tor@@ ren@@ tial ra@@ inf@@ all on several sides ; there is a possibility of f@@ all@@ out .
the south @-@ west coast is floo@@ ded from 6 to 12 , with an outbreak of up to 15 inhabitants , islands and coast@@ lines of up to 20 m / s .

attack in K@@ abu@@ l : NATO soldi@@ er killed in suicide attack
the suicide bom@@ b@@ ers attacked military con@@ vo@@ ys in the Afghan capital , K@@ abu@@ l , killing a NATO soldi@@ er and w@@ ounding several others .
the NATO statement said that five soldiers and interpreters were injured .
three civilians were also killed in an incident in the town of Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ hi , according to un@@ confirmed local reports .
this bom@@ bar@@ d@@ ment is the last of the acts of violence that have be@@ fallen Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in the Her@@ at mos@@ que attack .
on Monday , two people were killed by a suicide bom@@ ber in K@@ abu@@ l , near the Iraqi E@@ mb@@ assy .
the statement by NATO said that there was an explosion on Thursday evening when joint pat@@ ro@@ ls with the Afghan army were assa@@ ul@@ ted &apos; a man @-@ made explo@@ sive body &apos; .
the statement states that everything is in a stable position and is being treated at Bag@@ ra@@ m airport in a US military hospital .
according to reports , the ever @-@ growing forces in Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ hi , the Taliban and group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State in Bag@@ ra@@ i , are a source of serious concern to NATO forces in Bag@@ ra@@ m .
according to UN data , at least 16@@ 62 civilians have died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , of whom nearly 20 % in the capital city .
at the end of July a car bomb in K@@ abu@@ l was killed by at least 30 people , mainly in the S@@ hi &apos;@@ ite line .
the Taliban said they were behind the attack .
on 31 May more than 150 people were killed by a major bomb attack in the centre of the city , which has resulted in the most deaths in the military attack in the country since the US @-@ led forces rejected the Taliban in 2001 .
this violence highlights the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , while the US President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp is considering increasing the number of US troops helping the country &apos;s military and police .
according to cor@@ respondents , the suicide attacks in K@@ abu@@ l in recent weeks have also led to a public crisis of confidence in the government , its policies , and especially in President Ashraf G@@ h@@ an .
the EPA subsequently annul@@ led the decision to postpone the ski regulation
the United States Environment Protection Agency ( United States Environmental Protection Agency ) annul@@ led its decision to delay the introduction of a Obama regulation obli@@ ging states to limit emissions from the summer , one day after 15 states were taken to court by the agency .
the EPA announced the decision to proceed late on Wednesday with the &apos; 2015 ozone @-@ content @-@ setting procedures &apos; , saying that it shows the Agency &apos;s commitment to cooperating with the states .
&quot; we believe that we need to have a dialogue and listen to our state partners , &quot; said Scot@@ t P@@ ru@@ it@@ t .
P@@ ru@@ it was announced in June by the EPA &apos;s intention to postpone the ozone @-@ content levels in interoperability in order to determine in different parts of the country where this level should be reduced by one year until 2018 , in order to meet the highest air quality standard .
15 main democratic states , together with the C@@ olum@@ bia district , brought an action on Tuesday , saying that the decision was illegal .
President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s government has tried to pull back many of the environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama , which , according to T@@ ru@@ mp@@ n , are part of a more comprehensive plan for revi@@ ving economic growth .
however , these efforts have provoked reactions among the democrats and nature protection groups concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health .
the EPA website states that in@@ hal@@ ing the ozone @-@ containing air can &apos; reduce lun@@ g working capacity and increase the risk of res@@ pira@@ tory diseases &apos; , such as as@@ th@@ ma .
German pigs may come from a pi@@ pe .
German pigs and bo@@ vine animals can be caught because heavy rain is threatening the catch of the second largest wheat producer in the European Union , B@@ is@@ berg wri@@ tes .
this year , it may be the case that for weeks before harves@@ ting , fruit intended for the bread industry can only eat the animals .
&quot; content quality is far worse than soil and worse than in 2015 , &quot; said the A@@ gra@@ vis R@@ ai@@ ff@@ e@@ is@@ en analy@@ hard Mer@@ la analysis .
this year , up to 40 % of German wheat for animal fe@@ eds , which is double the standard , was forecast in A@@ gra@@ v .
German farmers , like their European colleagues , have come across all kinds of beau@@ ty this year .
first of all , the winter was too dry .
then came the spring , which was replaced by he@@ at@@ wave in June .
in July , Germany hit the German sa@@ ils , which have continued in August .
many eyes are on Northern Germany , where the rain ha@@ mp@@ ers harves@@ ts .
so far , only five per cent of wheat has been multipli@@ ed .
the majority of the region has not even reached the harvest level , announced the bu@@ yer of the local harvest in C@@ era@@ vis .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at is quite a difficult day , &apos; said Frank Dec@@ ker@@ t R@@ end@@ s@@ burg , a senior trader in C@@ era@@ vis .
consistency in everything , in other words , cu@@ mber@@ some b@@ ric@@ ks for Fin@@ ns &apos; internal design
in Ka@@ un@@ ia , nature plays its part in the tw@@ inning sur@@ f@@ ers , because through large win@@ dows the equ@@ ated views of the Sa@@ ima@@ a fishermen reach many of the rooms ( life ) .
every step in the face of the aspi@@ ration of our northern neighbours to create both sa@@ va@@ ge and perfect ( energy @-@ saving ) homes .
the ability to use Fin@@ ns &apos; timber as construction and processing materials , fur@@ ni@@ ture and beau@@ ty are worthy of compliance .
virtual techniques and cle@@ ver solutions can be found in tw@@ inning houses , both the buil@@ der and ( home ) de@@ sig@@ ner .
it is clear there that the composition of black , white and grey bot@@ tles , if they are supplemented by wood ton@@ es and food plants , can be very desperate .
there are still good ideas open for a week to come because the F@@ air will run until 13 August .
suppliers and her@@ bs suggest that this kit@@ chen is often cop@@ ied .
Se@@ oul today &apos;s drawing line for We@@ ek@@ end F@@ esti@@ val Baltic@@ a and Martin Garriga has done his utmost to remember as the last speaker .
the people were really revol@@ ving when Mr Garriga was speaking - the s@@ ong , the s@@ ong , the air , the dan@@ ced .
when Garriga x ended , a single mass of Per@@ sian be@@ ach was dis@@ ban@@ ded over the city .

M@@ ain@@ y Gar@@ cia and V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko meet for the first time and discuss possible confrontation
V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko and M@@ ain@@ y Gar@@ cia , who should be on the col@@ lisi@@ on course to face up to the most attractive bo@@ xing category for the near future , met for the first time on Thursday .
in L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t &apos;s office in L@@ OS An@@ ge@@ les , as long as Gar@@ cia , the un@@ winning World Boeing &apos;s ligh@@ t@@ weight champion , wal@@ ked to the other end of the corridor , to welcome L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t , the World Bo@@ main@@ z@@ ation@@ i sul@@ g@@ eri@@ ot .
after the unanimous decision of Gar@@ cia , both comb@@ at@@ ants are at the top five of the weigh@@ ted table table at the former four @-@ time world champi@@ ons Adri@@ en B@@ ron@@ ger .
Ms Gar@@ cia extended her better hand and said , &apos; Ho@@ w does you go , champion ?
I wish you every success . &quot;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko protects his bel@@ ts against Miguel Mar@@ ries on Saturday evening at 19 ES@@ P@@ N .
when a few photo@@ graph@@ s were available , the Mayor of L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko , E@@ gis Climate , stated that there would be a &apos; perfect measurement &apos; of the confrontation between the mili@@ tants .
&quot; I am a former consul@@ tant , &quot; recalled by Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I rise for B@@ ron@@ ger &#91; to 6@@ 3.5 kg &#93; , but I am not so large .
I am small for 6@@ 3.5 kg .
I want to move below the weight of ligh@@ t@@ weight .
and it must move up@@ wards with ligh@@ t@@ weight &#91; 6@@ 1.2 kg &#93; and then we can fight .
F@@ ans have asked for this .
then let us offer them that . &apos;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko agreed .
&apos;@@ The bo@@ xing world needs this fight &apos; .
( es ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the climate raised the question as to whether it should be cost @-@ effective , as part of his strategy of allowing L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ l to debate at the end of this year a class of 6@@ 1.2 kg to make it possible to meet with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 no@@ ses ) by next summer , who also has an interest in combating Jor@@ ge L@@ in@@ are@@ se and Lu@@ ke Cam@@ p@@ bel@@ l &apos;s match winner after their ligh@@ t@@ weight in For@@ u@@ el on 23 September .
&quot; looking at this fight could be cost @-@ effective , as f@@ ans have asked for this confrontation , &quot; said Gar@@ cia at a later date , saying that he was open to any channel that offers the best financial package .
&quot; we are the main actors .
no other name can attract so much attention .
wh@@ ic@@ he@@ ver time they are prepared ... &apos;
Gar@@ cia said that he considered L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t to be a &apos; powerful figh@@ ter &apos; and that he could go to see his match from Saturday to Saturday .
Mr L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko , in pra@@ ising Mrs Gar@@ cia , was ti@@ mid when she said that she thought that the champion of the three di@@ vis@@ u@@ als from Ri@@ ver@@ side was &apos; very slow ; sorry , M@@ ain@@ y ... you wanted this no@@ vel@@ s &apos; .
according to Gar@@ cia , the aim was to show strength and then to han@@ g .
they both affir@@ med that they felt the pressure is growing to try their way out of strength .
&quot; this is a fight that we need to make a reality .
no other confrontation aro@@ uses so much attention and attention .
I am more than willing to work towards this , &apos; said Gar@@ cia .
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko said , &apos; I have been waiting for the best mili@@ tants and M@@ ain@@ y has just done that .
this will be a good fight . &quot;
which of the world &apos;s be@@ aches to Estonia is being relocated ?
last year , the Police and Border Guard ( PP@@ A ) granted a record number of over 13@@ ,000 residence permits to third @-@ country nationals who have largely travelled to Estonia for work , study or family .
when , for example , a fixed @-@ term residence permit was decided on at least 6@@ 7@@ 02 foreigners , this figure was 4@@ 9@@ 28 .
the services cannot tell how many immigrants will eventually remain permanently in Estonia , but such an analysis will be prepared in the Ministry of the Interior .
while nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia ten years ago , in recent years this figure is close to 2 000 .
the number of applicants for residence permits increased expon@@ enti@@ ally during the Ukrainian crisis with 10@@ 87 fixed @-@ term residence permits in 2014 , up from 6@@ 75 in the previous year .
according to the statistics office , in Estonia , the highest number of Ukrainian citizens is growing - 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia last night more than left .
&quot; the Ukrainian community has always been big in Estonia and , due to difficult circumstances , it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many families are already facing it , &quot; said Kris@@ tin Ram@@ mus , spokes@@ man of the Interior Ministry .
in total , the number of Ukrainians granted a fixed @-@ term residence permit was higher than the number of Russian citizens , despite the fact that in 10 years , the latter have been granted the most fixed @-@ term residence permits .
when the Ukrainians largely come to work here , Russian citizens for family migration .
&apos;@@ G@@ iv@@ en the historical Russian community here , they are also most likely to have the greatest family ties with people living in Russia &apos; , the Internal Protection A@@ ca@@ de@@ my Hel@@ ina Me@@ ing , said .
&apos;@@ I@@ f you look at where Russian citizens who have been granted a residence permit in Estonia have moved to , after Har@@ t@@ land , Eastern Vir@@ u@@ ony &apos; , he added and pointed out that around 40 % of them were mar@@ ried by a European Union citizen .
the soil was granted a fixed @-@ term residence permit of 16@@ 96 Russian citizens , which is also a record number .
at the same time , the number of Russians who wanted to pro@@ long their residence permit decreased .
&quot; compensation is the result of a new residence permit for Estonia being requested rather than an extension of the residence permit , &quot; said Ram@@ mus , spokes@@ person of the Ministry of the Interior , who said that the interest of Russian citizens in Estonia &apos;s residence permit has remained stable for years .
the new residence permit for Estonia will allow foreigners who have lived here for at least three years to apply for it since last year .
its aim is to encourage the sincere saving of people who have adapted .
however , a long @-@ term resident permit requires , for example , five years .
the extension of the old residence permit has obviously been reduced because of the new residence permit .
last night , for example , such a residence permit was granted to Ukrainians , who have been working here for at least three years .
the Ukrainians will now be able to change their jobs , and the Estonian state will no longer point the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met .
this residence permit became a lever - holders of last year &apos;s bad passport ( 10@@ 29 ) , Russians ( 4@@ 87 ) , Indi@@ ans ( 54 ) and n@@ ig@@ ers ( 36 ) .
in total , 19@@ 68 people were granted a residence permit to live in Estonia , including 23 Americans , 12 Egypti@@ ans , 18 Georgi@@ ans and as many Chinese .
the first half of this year is already 12@@ 69 .
in 10 years , Nigeria has become , surpris@@ ingly , a country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for its residence permit .
in 2007 , when three residence permits were issued for young people , the soil was 200 .
Nigeria comes here to study at universities .
other higher education institutions in Estonia are popular among Georgi@@ ans , Chinese and Tur@@ ks , for example .
the number of citizens from India , Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen largely thanks to learning games .
for them , too , the rule is that where there is a community in advance , there will be others there more easily , &quot; Ram@@ mus added .
for 10 years , two people have also moved to Estonia from , for example , North Korea , just as much from La@@ os and Madagascar .
ten people have come here from Cuba , 2@@ 31 from South Korea , 40 from Indonesia and four from U@@ ru@@ guay .
if around 6 000 third @-@ country nationals get a residence permit a year , that is about 0.@@ 46 % of the total population .
even if we add to the citizens of the European Union , migration remains about a percentage , &quot; said the Me@@ use that , in fact , the numbers were small .
in total , 14 8@@ 22 people emig@@ rated to Estonia , out of which 13 7@@ 92 , according to the statistics office .
this means that immigration has over@@ taken a second year of emigration .
most of those who leave and move are Estonian citizens , but there are more among those who leave .
as a result , Estonian citizens &apos; migratory bub@@ ble of 2 000 people was negative .
Est@@ oni@@ ans in particular mig@@ rate between Finland and Estonia .
the P@@ rin@@ ce of M@@ ong C@@ ou@@ ture tri@@ gg@@ ers sa@@ cks , chic@@ k@@ ens and swe@@ at
however , there is still history for Maria Tampere in the ab@@ un@@ dance of ideas - old pa@@ int@@ ings and defen@@ dants : &apos; I can dream for hours somewhere in the muse@@ um and ad@@ m@@ ire the old thi@@ ev@@ es and cra@@ ts .
if you take a b@@ rick line , you will study and learn every day about it .
that is a joy of disco@@ very !
the M@@ ong C@@ ou@@ ture gla@@ mo@@ rous world may seem like a life @-@ alien , but the de@@ sig@@ ner does not think so .
you yourselves decide how much your life is !
as a friend , I am a friend with a whole sa@@ un full of my shar@@ ks of cou@@ ture .
because it is not his fault that he does not live in Hol@@ ly@@ wood and does not go to a red horse every day ; he wants to wear these most beautiful bro@@ kers , too !
you yourself will be able to live your life special !
the Mo@@ e@@ ar@@ tist does not recognise the gap between sh@@ ining events and bad day .
it was this reasoning that led to the rolling @-@ out of the plan to take the high @-@ profile in Estonia into the countryside , between forests and fields , between the people who often cannot be reached .
for example , a collection was presented on a comparison , J@@ air and Per@@ ka mo@@ e@@ alle@@ el , where the Qu@@ e@@ en of the Qu@@ e@@ en of 45 mo@@ del@@ s filled the entire street .
in Tallinn , you are often taken in in the shop , no@@ d@@ ding with dignity , but elsewhere there is more emo@@ tion : sh@@ ou@@ ting b@@ Bra@@ vo , rising up ; you want to thank you with com@@ passion .
much of the audience had to be cu@@ rious , but they are now M@@ y@@ long C@@ ou@@ ture f@@ ans .
if you live up to the expectations of the people , they are over@@ jo@@ yed !
and I like the feeling that I am with my fashion at the summer rec@@ ess .
Per@@ nus had a 50 @-@ me@@ tre red car@@ pet , full of rub@@ b@@ ish along the street , seemed not to have come to an end !
Maria also does not recognise the mo@@ tive that creation has to be presented by a super@@ sta@@ ll ; she will be happy to bring about ordinary women .
I often invite my own customers - they have always been happy .
that is how la@@ x the experience : you have found a wonderful k@@ ni@@ fe on the stage !
I am so sorry that I , myself , have never seen my play ; after all , I am always behind the shel@@ f in order to give things my last b@@ reat@@ h as a hope@@ less ac@@ tion@@ ist .
my ner@@ ve would not allow a peaceful eye on the floor .
Mrs Maria is the ar@@ tist of this kind , who not only wants to play a representative role , but also to be present in everything .
I have my mes@@ h machine on the radio , most of the colle@@ ctions being carried out myself .
I like the whole process where you have played with details , you will find it .
I am never a long way from my nature and I am not afraid of work .
it is not a matter of discipline , nor is it a matter of style , logistics , organisation , organisation , organisation - everything has to s@@ lide away from a single woman &apos;s day .
well , the fana@@ tics are still doing a huge amount of work .
I cannot say when my working day will end , but for me it is simply a day of joy !
I am still very lu@@ cky - it is like an un@@ ce@@ asing fortune : I do something nice , man gets something beautiful and , in turn , compli@@ ments .
it has been said several times that my bro@@ thers have a ma@@ gic t@@ reas@@ ure : they make themselves felt like a pr@@ inc@@ ess .
the abundan@@ t , dis@@ gus@@ ting cru@@ ci@@ fi@@ xes that made Maria talent in@@ audi@@ ble overnight have sta@@ yed to this day in the form of C@@ ou@@ ture signals .
Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ p of U@@ 18 boys : an al@@ ag@@ ro@@ sta@@ r weapon of Est@@ oni@@ ans has now been turned against us .
damage , fa@@ iry tale has run out .
the first thing that came to light was that we were not able to get our des@@ ks on our des@@ ks .
and when such a big difference has to be made on the table , &quot; Estonia commented 61 on U@@ 18 Cor@@ v@@ pal@@ li@@ ans : 75 British opt @-@ outs to Britain &apos;s only Kor@@ v@@ pal@@ ler , BC Kal@@ e@@ v / Cra@@ mo ab@@ it@@ re@@ en@@ er Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ p .
the opponents took 28 bal@@ ls out of the attack and , as a result , received so many more attacks .
nor were we prepared for their aggressive defence or attack ; it created it .
many Eng@@ lis@@ h@@ men &apos;s assa@@ ul@@ ts came to an end in three to five seconds ; we were unable to build up protection .
however , in defence , they were able to keep their hands there , we could not combine them .
it got the team back on its feet .
the ho@@ use@@ work of the opponents was better done .
M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ pa estimates that Estonia should have made more tac@@ tical mistakes in order to take the oppon@@ ent out in the b@@ reat@@ h .
the last quarter - we had a zero error , but the opponents had already received several quick times .
admi@@ ra@@ bility and intense insistence , which was the A@@ ag@@ ro@@ sta@@ r &apos;s weapon , have now turned against us all .
today , we had no strength against their agg@@ ressi@@ veness .
M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ p remained satisfied with his neg@@ ligence in Kal@@ ev@@ is , Mat@@ th@@ ias T@@ as@@ si .
in general , tourism can say good words about the whole team ; until now , there has been a single shock .
it is a pity that such an aggressive response had not been met before .
T@@ as@@ ty has always been self @-@ confident and played out today , but he seemed to have been ti@@ red - he has carried quite a great burden .
but he made some quite beautiful moves , which I have seen in trends in the past , &quot; added the men@@ tor .
hor@@ ren@@ d@@ ous numbers : the Cor@@ v@@ pal@@ li@@ er of kid@@ ne@@ ys in E@@ M tur@@ f se@@ ar@@ ched less than 10 points with three quarters ...
in the U@@ 18 age classes , not only do the Cor@@ v@@ pal@@ li@@ tur@@ ni@@ ir of emi B @-@ di@@ vis@@ j@@ on , in Tallinn , where she started in Dublin the day before yesterday .
and yet Estonia &apos;s game with Poland was bitter in the area of anti@@ qu@@ es@@ cor@@ ts .
Estonia lost 25 : 65 , but after a third quarter , the state of play was 9 : 49 , that is to say only in the last 10 minutes , the opponents took their feet from the gas pe@@ at , with a delay of 16 to 16 .
Estonia &apos;s 4 , 1 points ( 3 ) were outlined in both the first and the second quarter ...
in so doing , the Est@@ oni@@ ans initially caught two pieces from the first four of them in two minutes , and then two of the four ti@@ tles in the first two , but 25 pieces of the game , then one in the troika and then another 21 throw over ...
perhaps for almost half an hour , one of the 47 wh@@ is@@ tle@@ blow@@ s was tab@@ oo .
in addition , two points came from four free ton@@ es .
the losses at that time were a reasonable figure of 12 .
by the end of the game , Poland &apos;s hit hit 33 % and Estonia had 13 % ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has started to lose two , and Portugal &apos;s 83 : 56 best had to be recognised on the opening day .
NATO vessels came to Tallinn to re@@ plen@@ ish stocks
today , NATO &apos;s 1 permanent anti @-@ personnel group has arrived in Tallinn for the weekend on a planned port visit to improve ship stocks and prepare for the forthcoming exercise .
during their visit , ships are preparing for a return at sea , while allowing crew members to take pa@@ ir@@ ant leave .
following the visit , NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters in order to carry out a number of exercises and to be ready for future historical explo@@ sive operations .
&quot; the participation of Est@@ oni@@ ans in a NATO unit and the co @-@ training they carry out in local waters is a good illustration of our integration into alli@@ ed forces , &quot; said the Com@@ man@@ der of the Operation and Planning unit of the na@@ vy Com@@ man@@ der , Ar@@ to Rein@@ land .
since 29 June , NATO is leading the Latvian na@@ vi@@ do Lau@@ du@@ ps , cap@@ tain @-@ General of the Latvian Na@@ vy , at a ceremony in Riga to take over the tasks of the Com@@ man@@ der from the Estonian na@@ vy officer Joh@@ an @-@ E@@ li@@ as .
the group &apos;s flag@@ ships are L@@ V@@ N@@ S Vir@@ sa@@ itis , the Latvian na@@ vy support ship , which also has a group lead sta@@ r .
during this semester , the Estonian naval soldi@@ er , Sakharov , is also part of the international unit .
as one of the four groups of vessels subject to the NATO naval command , NATO is the 1 permanent anti @-@ personnel group that is part of the primary rapid reaction unit , which can be sent within five days to different parts of the world by the Alliance .
4 . - O@@ ver 13 August , the ancient ru@@ ins of the P@@ iri@@ ta mon@@ as@@ tery will once again become the place where the Ma@@ es@@ tro E@@ ri K@@ esti@@ val , called by Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val 13 years ago , will be de@@ ser@@ ted .
this year , Burma &apos;s F@@ esti@@ val , the artistic leader of Tallinn &apos;s philos@@ op@@ ian philos@@ op@@ her J@@ oo@@ sti ( 36 ) , says , is going to be beautiful , powerful and unprecedented .
risk to J@@ oo@@ st : Cuba &apos;s clas@@ s@@ room includes &apos; Tra@@ vi@@ eta &apos; and &apos; T@@ os@@ ca &apos; , bal@@ le@@ ti@@ la@@ responses from the ma@@ gic &apos; B@@ ole@@ ro@@ st &apos; lo@@ vely &apos; Car@@ l@@ ss@@ on@@ in &apos; , and neither is there a lack of ownership of the plan , this time by the wonderful or@@ ch@@ es@@ tra of Joseph Ha@@ y@@ d@@ ni &apos; A@@ asta@@ time , by the same international creative team that brought P@@ iri@@ la@@ ta Ha@@ y@@ d@@ ni even up a mas@@ ter@@ piece of work &apos; in 2015 .
Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val has much more than just concer@@ ts and theat@@ ric@@ al answers .
it is greater than any mus@@ ical theat@@ re in its normal form .
it is a festi@@ val whose s@@ now is taking hold and is never completely dis@@ solved .
because the experience the lis@@ ten@@ ers receive in this sup@@ erior and my@@ ste@@ rious environment makes human sou@@ ls more generous and touches on human models in a way that cannot be described .
at risk , you are the first year of the artistic leader of Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val .
did the Ma@@ es@@ tro E@@ ri K@@ ans not feel like a little big ?
of course , but since I had a very personal relationship with Mr Klaus , it has helped a great deal .
she went to me all over my student career and also supported me at the beginning of a di@@ ri@@ gis@@ me career .
it is perhaps thanks to this that it will be easier for me to continue his work .
there has been so much prosperity in@@ jected into the F@@ esti@@ val team of Bir@@ git@@ ta S@@ esti@@ val in K@@ las and , of course , it will be passed on to me as well .
it was excellent to join the team , who knows exactly how things are going .
it was the great heart of E@@ ri K@@ las@@ s that also gave me the strength to press ahead with Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val in Tallinn &apos;s film harmony .
and here I am , and I can !
what could the audience do at this year &apos;s F@@ esti@@ val , what are you offering in particular ?
we have a first bal@@ let , written to Mrs L@@ ind@@ gren &apos;s story , from England , Latvia , Lithuania and surpris@@ ingly .
&apos;@@ Kar@@ l@@ sson shall fly &apos; .
and a criminal n@@ ight@@ m@@ are about it is that it is the author of a bal@@ let in the Latvian com@@ po@@ ser , J@@ ur@@ is Kar@@ l@@ son , who himself expressed a wish to write it into .
obviously , she has already lived the Car@@ l@@ sson box , who has been alive since her child .
at the risk , how can you stick to all this ?
it is certainly thanks to my supporting partner .
such a job requires a support system and a lot of love , and I am fortuna@@ te to have a lot of love .
and I have noticed that my personal emo@@ tions do not depend on so many other people as I am , in other words , on how I go against every new day .
and such an awareness of tone , of maintaining a positive tone and , in fact , of s@@ mil@@ ing in a mir@@ ror in the morning , led my happ@@ iness to a great extent .
especially now this week , when there are the most important tests , I have been particularly keen on it and it is working .
to lau@@ gh itself is an ac@@ centu@@ ation of the brain and an increase in tone .
it is not just a hol@@ low word .
I think that people do not even know half of the things about their own body that the univer@@ se offers them , but let everyone find them little by little .
now is an important moment .
do you also have some ri@@ tual before taking the di@@ ri@@ gen@@ d w@@ ed@@ ding ?
there are still clothing to be replaced with more comfortable ones .
this is a small moment for itself .
but , overall , yes , I do not have the opportunity to pu@@ mp or make a small f@@ lash before there is a great deal .
in fact , I even like to engage actively with people , even before the di@@ ri@@ gen@@ e is taken .
but come to Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val@@ le , what can be discovered here is not a particularly large oper@@ a and bal@@ led friend !

new results of the age assessment tests for Swedish asylum seekers were published
the latest results of the test , which shows that more than 80 % of its constitution was judged to be older than 18 , but not all believe in the fine @-@ tu@@ ning of the results , were carried out by asylum seekers in Sweden .
the Swedish National Institute for for@@ en@@ si@@ c medicine ( &quot; R@@ un@@ ts@@ medicine in@@ al@@ ver@@ ket &quot; ) launched the tests earlier this year .
the tests were set up to assess age more precisely during the asylum application process , after the Swedish Office for Migration ( Migration ) was criticised for failing to properly determine the age of a number of ad@@ mittedly under@@ age refugees .
to date , 68@@ 80 cases have been sent by Migration to the trial , and the C@@ IS has published a total of 24@@ 81 tests between mid @-@ March and 31 July 2017 .
Eigh@@ ty per cent ( 2002 ) was estimated at the age of 18 or over , and in 25 other cases , the Institute of For@@ en@@ si@@ c medicine estimated that the test was &apos; perhaps 18 years old or older &apos; .
in 4@@ 32 cases , it has been concluded that a person is &apos; perhaps younger than 18 &apos; .
the tests will be used only in cases where people &apos;s age is in question .
according to Joh@@ an Gö@@ Franc@@ son , who is working in the institution of judicial medicine , the results are consistent compared to those of the past few months .
&apos;@@ We do not see much difference from the statistics of the past few months , the figures are quite consistent , &apos; said The Local newspaper .
it does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have shed light on their age for a large number of cases to be judged older than 18 .
in May , the Institute issued the 581 test results and said , in 4@@ 42 cases , &apos; there are indications that the person under investigation is 18 years old or older &apos; .
however , when newspaper Svensson Dag@@ bla@@ ed examined the results of this 581 test , it became clear that in 2@@ 43 cases the person had directly claimed that he would receive 18 this year .
this medical age assessment method , by carrying out smart ru@@ g photo@@ graph@@ s and by field classes MR@@ T , has been criticised in some quarters , after which they are allowed to be analysed by den@@ tists and radi@@ olo@@ gis@@ ts .
one of the sceptics is Claude Mar@@ cus , the K@@ aro@@ lin@@ ska Institute &apos;s endo@@ ch@@ rin@@ olo@@ gist , whose tasks include assessing people &apos;s biological maturity in order to find out whether they went through audi@@ ences sooner or later than normal .
&quot; I have had good reason to think about this and I do not think that the method of measurement that is currently in use should be used .
setting the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
if we cannot say so firmly , we should not pretend that we can , &apos; he said to Forest ro in his magaz@@ ine .
but Joh@@ an Gö@@ Franc@@ son from the Institute of For@@ en@@ si@@ c medicine defended the pun@@ ctu@@ ality of the tests : &apos; generally speaking , there is little risk of a child being left in@@ accurate .
the highest risk , that is to say , at around 10 % if a person is a little under 18 % . &quot;

Anna Maria O@@ rel , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old last @-@ year w@@ ol@@ f , gave the London M@@ il a nice po@@ t of debate by getting a good 18 with 6@@ 7.@@ 3@@ 07 .
after that , M@@ M &apos;s no@@ ori@@ um was a female dis@@ po@@ sa@@ ble and a jo@@ y@@ ful woman confirmed that she hopes to fight for med@@ als in the future .
the competition worked well and I had good experience .
the first test ( 6@@ 4.@@ 80 ) immediately took away my average result ; the second ( 6@@ 2.@@ 80 ) risk too much ; and the third ( 6@@ 7.@@ 37 ) was able to keep me clear &quot; said O@@ rel after the competition .
I was looking for my emissions and I am very pleased that I found them .
Mrs O@@ re@@ li M@@ M &apos;s debate ended with a good 18@@ th place .
Vi@@ h@@ mas@@ ad@@ u O@@ reli@@ t did not b@@ other , because he is on strike through the LTTE sta@@ di@@ um .
&apos;@@ I am fea@@ red &apos; , he said a little mu@@ te .
the London Olympic sta@@ di@@ um had almost a full @-@ house people ; after that , did he get people around or were able to turn themselves off ?
Mr Tajani has done so , but in a positive sense .
everyone says it adds - that is how it is !
if you compete on your own , you can experience it .
he then reas@@ sured me that he is satisfied with the debate on M@@ M , and he still has many good competitions ahead of him : &apos; I have come here with the 3@@ 2nd , with the last result , I ended in 18@@ th place .
this is a very good result .
I am a 20 @-@ year @-@ old man - that is the only thing that matters .
I take away a good experience and in some days I want to compete on behalf of med@@ als .
Western Vir@@ g@@ ina Governor announced party change
the Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a Democrat govern@@ or , Jim Justice , announced at a Thursday evening meeting with President T@@ ru@@ p that he would change political parties .
&quot; be that or not , the democrats wal@@ ked away from me , &quot; said Governor Justice .
&apos;@@ Today I say to you , having said a great deal of pra@@ yer and thought ... today , I am telling you , the Western vir@@ g@@ ins , that I can no longer help you as a democratic govern@@ or . &apos;
there were re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ations of joy at the meeting .
&quot; so I will be a Re@@ publi@@ can tomorrow , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a engine@@ er , I would say to you that it is time to play a different game . &quot;
the T@@ ru@@ mp had previously promised a major announcement at the Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a gathering .
T@@ ru@@ mp w@@ ins Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ as with 42 points and Justice did not support the Democrat candidate , H@@ ill@@ ary Clin@@ ton .
justice , which is the only bil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e in the state according to For@@ bes@@ i , was elected in 2016 .
in For@@ be , it has coal mines in five states and the coal business on its own .
it is worth around USD 1.@@ 59 billion .
at the same time , the Re@@ publi@@ can National Committee ( R@@ N@@ C ) issued an announcement on Thursday evening that &apos; the party change of Governor Justice is another blow to a democratic party that would prevent the country from improving again rather than working towards it &apos; .
&quot; only 15 Governor Justice &apos;s announcement of the lowest number of states in his history is simply the most recent wake @-@ up call for a park that is from the bottom to the bottom and unable to find a positive and uni@@ fying message , &quot; said R@@ N@@ C chair@@ woman R@@ on@@ na Mc@@ Daniel &apos;s statement to C@@ S New@@ si .
it is perhaps no surprise that , where there are many people , there are also many injured .
Ur@@ met , in her medical tent on the web , told the A@@ ca@@ de@@ my , yesterday , that they had to allocate quite a lot of pos@@ ters .
cereals and mar@@ ches are the main , the wrong and the light fall .
of course , head@@ lines , s@@ qua@@ res and sho@@ es as well .
according to Ur@@ me@@ ti , visitors come to the festi@@ val with false sho@@ es , and that is how the problems come .
the media have also had to help visitors with a few major injuries - there have been some panic and there has also been one sho@@ wer .
we have also been s@@ tun@@ ning when a person has sha@@ ck@@ led his hand or his finger .
we are going to make smaller nur@@ ses here , we are sending them more to hospitals .

Co@@ e congratulated the Russians on their honest apolo@@ gy for the D@@ oping scandal
S@@ ebas@@ tian Co@@ e , the International S@@ ebas@@ tian Air Force , said that he had &apos; an honest apolo@@ gy from Russia on Thursday for the D@@ oping Can@@ al &apos; , repeated that now is not the time for the country to rec@@ lai@@ m sport .
at the eve of the ligh@@ t@@ weight World C@@ up , the Russian ligh@@ t@@ ning force , D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lit@@ h@@ tin , said at IA@@ AF Congress , that the competition ban imposed on her country was the right one , with a clear aim to combat doping .
he apolog@@ ised &apos; all the ath@@ le@@ tes who have been squ@@ ee@@ zed away by the gol@@ den and sil@@ ver med@@ als in the competitions &apos; .
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted to maintain the ban on state @-@ spon@@ sored doping in the contest , which was introduced in November 2015 , after the W@@ AD@@ A report found evidence of state @-@ spon@@ sored doping in Russia .
&quot; I think today was a very honest response , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to journalists .
&quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian League itself acknowledged that they have had quite challenging times and that they would do everything they could to restructure the Union . &quot;
in addition , Co@@ e said that he was delighted that Russia accepted the criteria for its own return .
&quot; I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is being made , but Congress supports the working group &apos;s proposal that this is not the right time to withdraw Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; in the next few months , we must do our utmost to norm@@ alise the situation .
we have always been guided by the principle that we want to separate clean ath@@ le@@ tes from a system that has been broken , &quot; he added .
Eigh@@ teen Russian ath@@ le@@ tes meeting the strict criteria for IA@@ AF will compete as neutral ath@@ le@@ tes at the World C@@ up in London on Friday .
the chair of the IA@@ AF working group , R@@ une Andersson , said on Monday that Russia does not yet meet a number of sustainability criteria .
following a brief@@ ing by the IA@@ AF Council , he told journalists in London that doping control was still inadequate and that une@@ le@@ cted train@@ ers were still operating freely .
the electric car revolution is dramatically changing the demand for metals .
who are the winners and the losers ?
not only will the electric car revolution change everything from the fuel market to the infrastructure , it will also create new winners and losers in the me@@ tal market .
although mining gi@@ ants like G@@ len@@ core can say that they will win from one place and lose out from another , the smaller mining firms will not help .
at present , G@@ len@@ core coal and oil serve , but future demand for co@@ ca@@ ts , li@@ thi@@ um , cop@@ per , alu@@ mini@@ um and cop@@ per will increase in the age of electric cars .
this year governments in the United Kingdom , France and Norway have made contributions to the spread of electric cars , allowing the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be banned in the coming decades .
so Mr Vol@@ vo has already been aware that they are planning to abandon the internal combustion engine , and T@@ es@@ la is putting a cheaper gu@@ est 3 electric cars on the market .
B@@ om@@ berg New Energy Finance predi@@ cts that over two decades , electric cars will be sold more than oil @-@ fired cars .
&quot; for some metals this will change everything , &quot; said the Capital Economics raw materials analy@@ st Sim@@ ona G@@ amb@@ ran@@ ini B@@ is@@ berg .
we have already seen a major impact on metals such as co@@ ca@@ ine and li@@ thi@@ um , the demand for which has been growing for years .
electric cars have about three times more answers than the conventional car , according to the G@@ len@@ core .
more answers are needed at re@@ charging stations , so Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris estimates that it will increase demand for cop@@ per by around 5 % by 2025 .
an increase in demand for electric vehicle bat@@ teries means an additional demand for li@@ thi@@ um , co@@ sco@@ t , gra@@ b and man@@ gan@@ ese .
the G@@ len@@ core will generate revenues from the growing trend for electric cars from the cop@@ per price increase and from being the world &apos;s largest producer of co@@ sco@@ pes , as envisaged by the J@@ eff@@ coordinate Group .
this bro@@ ker company estimates that the other electric car race will be won by the F@@ Friday report @-@ Mc@@ Mo@@ R@@ an and First Qu@@ an@@ ma Min@@ er@@ als .
the market is reacting to an already changing trend .
this year , 70 per cent of metal@@ lic fish have been bur@@ nt in London .
the rise in soil prices was 37 % .
the left has also gone up 14 % this year , mainly because of economic growth .
G@@ len@@ core excise duty in London rose by 20 % , having exceeded the ri@@ val of the Rio T@@ into Group , B@@ H@@ P Bil@@ lit@@ on and Ang@@ lo telecom .
lead companies such as Rec@@ y@@ cle@@ x and Cam@@ p@@ ine are on the side of the losers and will have to adapt to the new era .
the main end @-@ use of the gas is the bat@@ teries supplying the star@@ ters of cars with a petrol and diesel engine .
electric cars use li@@ thi@@ um bat@@ teries .
&quot; this is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found for other purposes to overcome the fall in demand , &quot; Michael W@@ id@@ mer , President of the American Mer@@ ri@@ ll Lyn@@ ch me@@ tal market , said .
as yet , the effect of the open @-@ flow trend has not been notic@@ eable in the form of price movements .
P@@ li@@ i has risen by 17 % this year , and this is the best me@@ tal in London , among the main industrial metals .
investors will only see problems for the me@@ tal far from in the future .
&quot; I am not sure that lead is such a bad thing because cheap oil keeps conventional cars in competition , &quot; said Her@@ wi@@ g Schmidt , the selle@@ r of Tri@@ land Me@@ tal@@ s .
if lead demand falls , it will be slow .
that may be the case in about ten years &apos; time .
in the meantime , stricter emission standards mean an increase in demand for hybrid cars , which depend heavily on developed lead @-@ based bat@@ teries to launch engines , will be assessed by an international lead @-@ based research organisation .
Ker@@ g@@ metals such as alu@@ mini@@ um replace steel , as a ligh@@ ter car can drive further with less electricity .
this can already be explained by an additional minimum of 1.6 million tonnes by 2013 @-@ 2016 .
this represents 2.7 % of the world &apos;s production of alu@@ mini@@ um .
this trend is likely to wor@@ sen , Mr W@@ id@@ mer said .
A@@ lu@@ mini@@ um has risen by 13 % this year , as growing demand from car manufacturers has led to a market deficit .
steel manufacturers will not .
ak S@@ way holding works with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce mira@@ cul@@ ous car chains .
Ar@@ cel@@ or@@ Mit@@ tal and Ta@@ ta Europe are also trying to develop a ligh@@ ter mel@@ t@@ down from steel in order to counter the lower minimum .
&apos;@@ One @-@ strong steel should be the answer to this development &apos; , said Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris analysis by Syl@@ vain Br@@ un@@ et .
there is some progress in Europe .
the end of the oil era can also bring suffering to the pla@@ te .
it took around half of it as cataly@@ sts for cars with a precious diesel engine , it reported me@@ tal re@@ fin@@ er Joh@@ n@@ son Mat@@ they .
&quot; many of the raw materials that are now highly demand , such as oil and pos@@ ter , may not have great demand in the future , &quot; said Bernard D@@ ah@@ da@@ h , the Na@@ ti@@ x raw materials analy@@ st .
this does not mean that the raw materials as a whole are becoming less important , but their importance will change over 15 years .
the plan manufacturers believe in continued demand for diesel hybrid cars .
Marc G@@ ry@@ n@@ berg , the leader of Un@@ core , said that in 2025 more hybrid cars will continue to be sold as hybrid .
in the 10 @-@ year perspective of the plan manufacturers , To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Motors and Hy@@ alus@@ i Mo@@ tos are developed on hydrogen @-@ based cars that depend on a pla@@ tin@@ um to produce hydrogen @-@ based electricity .
so far , however , this technology has not yet been commercially justified .
&quot; dialogue seems to be a clear lo@@ ser on the road to electric cars , &quot; said Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P from Paris to Br@@ un@@ et .
German car manufacturers suffered a major set@@ back in July , as the court in S@@ tut@@ t@@ g@@ art banned diesel in the home town of Mercedes @-@ Ben@@ z and Por@@ sch@@ e .
how financial rules for football affect Ney@@ mar@@ i &apos;s transition to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing the un@@ bri@@ dled spending of European football clubs do not prevent the record transfer of the Ney@@ ra World Ex@@ po from a Spanish football club in the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences for UEFA , the governing body that domin@@ ates the European game and is in a position to prevent cre@@ ws from participating in a pres@@ ti@@ gious League of Ministers &apos; tur@@ f , await the Paris Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ Ma@@ in .
the financial rules for fair play ( F@@ F@@ F@@ P ) introduced by UEFA in 2011 mean that the PS@@ G will have to demonstrate at some point that the Ney@@ mar transition was financed without huge losses .
Barcelona was paid EUR 2@@ 22 million ( USD 2@@ 62 million ) just for buying out its treaty by the friend , and Ney@@ mar@@ i &apos;s salary will reach tens of millions of dollars a year .
there are some financial aspects of Ney@@ mar@@ i &apos;s transfer to the French club .
the PS@@ G will no doubt be in a position to come up with such money to recruit Ney@@ mar@@ i and to put its sta@@ rs on the map , given that the team will be funded by the family governing the Ka@@ tar Energy bill .
clubs are allowed to spend a great deal of money on recru@@ iting players , but they have to balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to get out of the football business .
the F@@ F@@ F@@ P was initiated by Michel Pla@@ tini after his election as President of UEFA in 2007 .
this former French player believed that clubs in search of success are actually engaging in fraud and ris@@ king ruin if banks or owners were to give up subsidies .
from 2011 , rather than debt for F@@ F@@ P clubs , the focus will be on monitoring these losses .
this change means that the business model that Ro@@ man Ab@@ ra@@ mo@@ vi@@ ch used first in 2003 in C@@ hel@@ sea - to buy a club of potential and then to spend a great deal on improving the team and creating a global trade mark - is more difficult to implement .
during the current three @-@ year evaluation period for the F@@ F@@ F@@ P , which runs until 2018 , clubs can bear losses of up to EUR 30 million .
and even though Pla@@ tini was shame@@ lessly excluded from the presidential office in 2015 , his successor to UEFA , Alexander C@@ ef@@ er@@ in , remains committed to ob@@ struc@@ ting excessive spending .
&quot; the F@@ P is certainly not dead and we will no doubt continue to strengthen these rules , &quot; said The associated P@@ rin@@ le Andre@@ a Tra@@ ver@@ so last week , UEFA @-@ s F@@ F@@ F@@ P &apos;s watch@@ dog .
although PS@@ G pay for the Ney@@ mar@@ i over@@ purchase clause as a single full pay@@ out , they will be able to distribute this amount for accounting purposes for the entire duration of the agreement .
Ney@@ mar concluded a five @-@ year agreement , which makes it possible to demonstrate a transitional fee of EUR 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million over the next five years .
on the first wave of F@@ F@@ F@@ P sanctions in 2014 , PS@@ G , together with Manch@@ ester C@@ it@@ y@@ i from Abu D@@ ha@@ bi , suffered the most severe penalties .
a fine of EUR 60 million ( currently EUR 82 million ) was imposed on the PS@@ G , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million , and a club was requested to limit the League of Me@@ is@@ ters &apos; team to 21 players in the 2014 @-@ 2015 season instead of normal 25 .
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to cross @-@ select financial regulators by inf@@ lating their revenues through companies associated with the owners of the club .
although a company of Q@@ a@@ tar may spon@@ sor PS@@ G , if the value of spon@@ sorship were considered to be above standard market rates , UEFA would not allow it to be taken into account as an official income .
this happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that Q@@ a@@ tar Tourism Authority &apos;s value of PS@@ G support was inf@@ lated .
it has been said that a certain section of the Ney@@ mar@@ i PS@@ G service may come from payments via the 20 @-@ 22 World C@@ up Management Committee .
however , PS@@ G and Q@@ a@@ tar 20@@ 22 deny that Ney@@ mar@@ i could become part of the World C@@ up and claim that UEFA &apos;s regulators could easily un@@ cover such a manoeuvre .
the penalties previously imposed on the PS@@ G mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant in any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
people who were familiar with the situation will say on Thursday that UEFA has not discussed the transition pro@@ actively with PS@@ G Ney@@ mar@@ i .
they talked to The associated Congress on condition that their anon@@ y@@ mity is guaranteed , as they are not allowed to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest reports show that the PS@@ G will make profits of more than € 10 million during the 2015 @-@ 2016 season at around € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the latest financial year data have not yet been published .
PS@@ G hopes that the arrival of Ney@@ ra will have a positive impact on spon@@ sorship deals , commerci@@ alisation and brand sales .
the club is looking forward to an increase of at least 30 per cent in relation to the conclusion of the contract .
Spain too , clearly anno@@ yed by the departure of one of the largest football sta@@ rs , tried to prevent the Ney@@ mar@@ i transition by claiming that the PS@@ G was in breach of F@@ F@@ P .
&apos;@@ This is the clear case of &apos; financial doping &apos; with the club and state &apos; said to the Spanish newspaper , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , with President La T@@ eb@@ as , indicating that the PS@@ G mainly belongs to Q@@ a@@ tar .
the Ar@@ sen@@ al ru@@ g@@ ger , Ar@@ connect W@@ en@@ ger , whose club belongs to the American sporting mag@@ na@@ te , shares with La li the attitude of state funding for the club .
&apos;@@ This is a consequence of property rights and has changed the entire football landscape completely over the past 15 years &apos; said W@@ en@@ ger on Thursday .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen a club belongs to a state , everything is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play , since the country can have other ways or other interests to make such a big player represent the country . &quot;

the Mil@@ k Par@@ k and the P@@ ad@@ ise Par@@ k were swe@@ pt from the Ma@@ in , but our mon@@ k par@@ ks were also severely affected .
in Tallinn , win@@ ds were measured at a speed of up to 35 metres per second , in other words , approximately 130 km per hour .
in Tallinn , in M@@ eri@@ lo , on the evening of 6 August , one of the te@@ ars of lead had sh@@ ou@@ ted : &apos; mother , mother !
the chic@@ k@@ ens are in the air and can no longer be signed ! &apos; , the Official Journal of Vir@@ u@@ Country has written .
the generation &apos;s term building in Vil@@ j@@ an@@ ore was destroyed by the storm to such an extent that it was decided to be dem@@ ol@@ ished at a later date .
the design of T@@ ü@@ r &apos;s ski moun@@ tains did not stand up to the August storm , which was not later restored .
on 12 August 1967 , the newspaper Red T@@ ae@@ t wrote that the urb@@ anisation of towns and settlements from bur@@ ned trees and their ox@@ y@@ gen was progressing slowly , and that the population could get involved in cleaning work .
fruit fields were also severely affected by the storm , and the newspaper stated that &apos; party @-@ to @-@ party organisations must be both an incentive and a gu@@ ide@@ line for fer@@ tility work and for fer@@ tile harves@@ ts &apos; .
they can be discussed in cases where average wind speed exceeds 3@@ 2.7 m / s .
the net wind record in Estonia will remain in place from 2 November 19@@ 69 , when Ru@@ h@@ ent measured the wind at a speed of 48 m / s .
the V@@ only story on the island broke the s@@ word , so the solid wind measured there could not be accurately recorded .
secret of poor bathing areas : night @-@ to @-@ night cleaning and poor coastal beau@@ ty
cold summer bel@@ ls also mean less duplication in the ski areas of Tallinn .
&apos;@@ I@@ f it is not , people are on the be@@ ach and , if it is not , there are no people &apos; , it is the cor@@ ner who says the floor .
in the S@@ tro@@ om be@@ ach of Northern Tallinn , ca@@ f@@ es are being tor@@ n up .
they are offered by a tra@@ ctor running at low tur@@ na@@ round turns of me@@ chan@@ ical competition that is pl@@ undering the pla@@ tin@@ um .
in fact , the latter sa@@ ves seven c@@ enti@@ metres from dep@@ ths through the sand , collecting marine lit@@ ter and the risk that people have been left behind : bot@@ tles , cigarettes and so on .
people still come to ran@@ k , regardless of whether the water is warm or not .
if the weather is beautiful , people are on the be@@ ach and , if it is not , there are no people &apos; , the management of the company Ha@@ ab@@ er will say Alexander r U@@ so@@ v , the head of the maintenance work on the floor .
at 6.@@ 30 o &apos;@@ clock , there is a bitter clean @-@ up on the be@@ ach , because at 8 o &apos;@@ clock the pos@@ ter must be in order for the people .
the s@@ ong is already at four o &apos;@@ clock .
apart from S@@ tro@@ om , he is still keeping an eye on P@@ iri@@ ta , La@@ ke Har@@ vel , Ka@@ ku@@ p and Pal@@ eri@@ a@@ are P@@ ik@@ ak@@ ari .
landfills have been reduced .
years ago , there were many more .
people now know how to assess what is being done for them &apos; , U@@ so@@ v , who has pic@@ ked the sho@@ es for 15 years , speaks .
it used to be the case that , when something new was put up , it was already broken next day .
now what is on the be@@ ach is already being kept .
price of a clean be@@ ach
one of the biggest jobs on the Estonian be@@ aches is the clean @-@ up of marine rub@@ b@@ ish , known as ad@@ ole@@ sc@@ ent .
for example , on the surface of P@@ iri@@ ta , it must be transported to 400 000 tonnes during the coastal season .
&apos;@@ This is an un@@ beli@@ evable amount , &apos; notes U@@ so@@ v .
the second major category is municipal rub@@ b@@ ish , or everything that people leave behind themselves .
at the one and a half kilometres on the S@@ tro@@ om coast , there are eight large waste ti@@ tles that need to be emp@@ tied three times a week .
so much rub@@ b@@ ish arises .
however , the cold summer bel@@ ls have meant that the rub@@ b@@ ish is one @-@ fifth less than otherwise .
the third species is de@@ ser@@ ted objects .
these are mostly cargo journeys .
this time , U@@ so@@ v has pul@@ led out of the sand inside tens of rub@@ b@@ ish .
they will wait for the owners to be@@ set the timber route .
&apos;@@ normally more comes out of them , but that is a normal harvest &apos; , which already knows that it will soon find them back in the sand .
children come to be@@ ach and take toys to sw@@ am@@ p them in the sand again .
Prüm is being tor@@ n up
Erika Sch@@ ol@@ ler , the spokes@@ person for administrative services , ad@@ mits that the tra@@ ctor &apos;s screening work is disrup@@ ting local communities .
noise , which runs from night to hours of ste@@ am , inter@@ fe@@ res with the ad@@ jac@@ ent population .
however , that work is impossible on a day @-@ to @-@ day basis .
in one month , it comes through the war@@ fare twice .
&apos;@@ I@@ f we do not , we will be fined by the city section &apos; , Mr Sch@@ ol@@ ler will note .
however , like P@@ iri@@ ta , P@@ ik@@ ka@@ r and Per@@ sian , the aim is to have S@@ tro@@ om rand included in the international Se@@ oul quality mark .
&quot; there is much more work in Estonia to ensure that the be@@ aches are ca@@ red for than Europe , &quot; says Sch@@ ol@@ ler .
we have more ad@@ ole@@ sc@@ ence and stone , and it is more difficult to drive in the sand .
however , we have less rub@@ b@@ ish on our be@@ aches than elsewhere in Europe .
listening to the talk of rub@@ b@@ ish on the be@@ ach , Martin be@@ side S@@ tro@@ om is moving around un@@ soli@@ cited inter@@ lo@@ cu@@ tors of journalists and fla@@ ten@@ ers , highlighting the current weaknesses on the floor .
Hom@@ o is a picture everywhere in the gallery .
the problem is the birds and net sla@@ ves who have got the rub@@ b@@ ish bags on the f@@ ring@@ es &apos; , Martin decla@@ res .
although it is difficult to assume that people can change their behaviour to date , Martin hopes that the urban government will do something about the waste b@@ in chains and impose on them , for example , the camer@@ as , in order to prevent them , at least on the birds , from finding their way into the news .
in general , however , Mr S@@ tro@@ om &apos;s be@@ ach is satisfied with developments .
we can see that the city is taking care of this .
it has become more pleasant with children &apos;s s@@ qua@@ res , enligh@@ tened and fresh as@@ cep@@ ted roads .
it used to be the case that only one road was able to be travelled on a case @-@ by @-@ case basis , &quot; says Martin .
A@@ ar@@ de@@ to@@ te bread in S@@ tro@@ om : coins , only coins

he does not believe that , today or in the future , he will find anything precious .
marine God is not generous enough .
&apos;@@ I have been working on this for a year and have so far found nothing valuable &apos; , says D@@ mit@@ ry .
as a reser@@ vo@@ ir , the D@@ mit@@ ry T@@ reas@@ ure D@@ mit@@ ry is a few euro coins , pu@@ mps and also a dangerous p@@ ound that will subsequently be thrown in the b@@ in .

Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to be informed that interest rates will be maintained as weak economic growth and the easing of inflation have da@@ m@@ pen@@ ed speculation on the rise .
Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain slu@@ gg@@ ish as households &apos; hard @-@ pressed incomes have put interest rates on hold .
policy @-@ makers of the Bank &apos;s Monetary Policy Committee ( MP@@ C ) voted for a 6 : 2 % retention , and fewer members will be demanding an increase this month , as slow economic growth has weakened support for the up@@ turn .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank cut its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on household incomes would persist , as inflation is still expected to rise to 3 % in the autumn .
at the same time , the Bank also sign@@ alled that the increase in rates will be necessary to contain inflation due to Bre@@ x over the next few years , and the financial markets may require an expected increase in lending costs .
Members also voted in favour of the partial withdrawal of the ma@@ m@@ mot@@ h package , which was triggered a year ago by Bre@@ x .
in February , the Bank will termin@@ ate its fixed @-@ term financing scheme , which provides cheap funding to the banks , even though it said that it now expects an increase of GBP 15 billion under this scheme , which is GBP 115 billion .
in the minutes of the decision on the rate , the Bank says that &apos; gross domestic product ( GDP ) will remain power@@ less in the near future as the difficult situation of real household incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption &apos; .
in terms of rates , it was reiterated that , in order to reduce inflation , there was a need for &apos; some effort to be made by monetary policy &apos; and &apos; somewhat higher &apos; than expected on the markets .
Mr Bö@@ rs is now forecas@@ ting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second one in 2020 .
however , the Bank stressed that any ju@@ mp is gradual and limited .
the Bank &apos;s reduced growth projections for this year and next year are comparable to 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
the projec@@ tion of 1.8 % growth in 2018 remained unchanged .
after that news , the p@@ ound went down against the dollar and the euro .
Na@@ el has fallen by 0.5 % to USD 1.@@ 31 and by 0.@@ 4 % to EUR 1.@@ 11 .
the decision not to make any changes is due to recent disappointing growth figures , which have da@@ m@@ pen@@ ed hopes of an up@@ surge in intellectual GDP in the second quarter , at 0.2 % in the previous three months , at 0.@@ 3 % .
the Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.@@ 3 % in the third quarter , even though it will gather some momentum at the end of the year .
the Bank &apos;s most recent inflation report gave little reason to re@@ jo@@ ice with rising inflation and ab@@ ject wage increases to households by saying that the situation will get even worse before improving .
it was added that the monetary policy cannot prevent an income blow in the next few years , but a marked recovery in wages is expected towards the end of the three @-@ year forecast .
due to the na@@ il p@@ ound , the economy is also stimu@@ lated by the growing demand for British produce , which will partly compensate consumers for the lower costs .
the decision comes one year after the rates were taken last August at 0.@@ 25 % after the shocking EU referendum , which caused the p@@ ound to collapse .
the bank estimates that it is likely to take four years to brea@@ the full life into prices and the economy .
before the final decision of the Bank , growing demand for the rate had been felt as inflation had increased the pressure on hard @-@ pressed households ; in July , three policy @-@ makers called for an increase of 0.5 % .
inflation fell by 2.6 % last month , compared to 2.9 % in June , although the bank said it was expected to rise again in the coming months .
the Bank said that excessive growth compared to the 2 % target was entirely due to the weak p@@ ound .
Mr Mon@@ t@@ la@@ ke , the head of the Co@@ rec@@ o mortgage bro@@ kers , said : &apos; in view of the recent downturn in exchange rates , it seems that the mortgage market will become increasingly competitive again , as creditors will want to work and look forward to concluding the year positively .
Eurosta@@ rs seems particularly favourable to those whose existing transactions are coming to an end , since re@@ financing , often without ear@@ marking and at low rates , has become increasingly popular . &quot;
the N@@ HS is writing 10 000 HIV drugs that cause conflict to people
since September , patients have had access to &apos; trans@@ forma@@ tive &apos; HIV @-@ preventive treatment , following a battle w@@ aged by the Supreme Court over whether the N@@ HS should finance the medicine .
the N@@ HS England reported that public health care is now estimated to make available to 10 000 people during the initial three @-@ year clinical trial - a ta@@ ble@@ t man@@ ned before the rec@@ ess , which has shown about 86 % reduction in the risk of infection for high @-@ risk people .
the N@@ HS has agreed to fund a clinical attempt after the Court of appeal supported last year &apos;s Supreme Court ruling that the N@@ HS will be able to pay for Pr@@ EP , despite the institution &apos;s own claims that the medicine should be funded by local authorities .
the chief executive of the N@@ HS Eng@@ land , Simon Ste@@ crates , welcomed the launch unve@@ iled on Thursday as &apos; new , far @-@ reaching intervention &apos; , while the National AIDS Fund ( NA@@ T ) described it as a &apos; land@@ mark moment &apos; .
sexual health clin@@ ics in London , B@@ right ton , Manch@@ ester , Li@@ ver@@ pool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to register people , and in October there will be more clin@@ ics before the programme is put in place everywhere in England by April 2018 .
the Pr@@ EP , which is the pro@@ phy@@ la@@ ctic of a C@@ inde@@ rella , is an act of HIV medi@@ cation before the rec@@ ess to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
clinical trials show that the Pr@@ EP significantly reduces transmission of HIV to people at risk of infection .
the introduction of the Pr@@ EP before the rec@@ ess means that there are enough medicines in the body of the human being that prevent HIV from being infected .
such medicinal products can be taken every day , or at the latest two hours before the rec@@ ess .
successful candidates include les@@ bian or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ gender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and cannot be treated .
clin@@ ics are identified by suitable people willing to take part in clinical trial , including men , women , trans@@ gender people and those whose HIV @-@ related partner cannot receive anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment .
people who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there can also register their wish to participate in the local sexual health clin@@ ics participating in the programme .
the programme costs GBP 10 million and the N@@ HS England signed the contract to obtain medicines this week following an international procurement procedure .
the purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the true potential of the Pr@@ EP by gathering clinical evidence of who the medicine is intended for and how it is consumed and implemented in a big picture .
Ste@@ crates said : &apos; this new massive intervention should complement and intensify the wide @-@ ranging and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV .
this is yet another milestone in the more than three decades of fighting one of humanity &apos;s greatest health problems . &quot;
D@@ eb@@ or@@ ah gold , CE@@ O of NA@@ T , said , &apos; This is a land@@ mark moment in the fight against HIV .
the Pr@@ EP , if properly targeted at those who need it and are at risk , will offer an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England .
since September , people with a high risk of HIV in England have had access , through this clinical trial funded by the N@@ HS , to a powerful new tool that is individually man@@ age@@ able and does not depend on negotiations with a partner , thereby improving many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
ian Green , the CE@@ O of the Ter@@ rence Higgins Fund , said : &apos; now it is a priority to ensure that the clinical trial is carried out quickly across the country and that none of the people at risk of HIV is left behind .
now that the Pr@@ EP clinical trial has been obtained , we are on the way to protecting more than 10 000 people who are at risk of being infected with HIV .
the Minister for Public Health , Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , said : &apos; the start of the Pr@@ EP clinical trial is very welcome and long overdue after months of delay and government te@@ aring its feet .
evidence shows how much change this medicine can make to HIV prevention and to stop the spread of this life @-@ changing infection .
this clinical test takes us one step closer to a full understanding of the Pr@@ EP &apos;s advantages .
now it is important that the clinical trial is taken over as soon as possible to protect people who have contact with HIV and to bring us one step closer to halting the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
electricity prices increased by 12 % in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
the difference in electricity prices between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania was reduced to € 1.@@ 94 next day , compared to € 7.@@ 71 in June this year .
the main cause of the price difference is the rich@@ ness of the Lithuanian @-@ Swedish Community .
in Estonia , the average electricity stock exchange price last month was EUR 34.@@ 33 per me@@ ga@@ t hour and the price went up by 12 per cent compared to June .
in Latvia and Lithuania the price fell by five per cent to EUR 3@@ 6.@@ 27 per me@@ ga@@ phone hour .
in Finland , the price was EUR 3@@ 4.@@ 17 and the system price of the electricity exchanges in the north was EUR 2@@ 6.@@ 37 per me@@ ga@@ phone hour .
prices rose by 12 and seven per cent respectively .
between Estonia and Finland , electricity moved 75 % of last month &apos;s hours to Estonia and 16 % of hours from Estonia to Finland .
the remaining nine per cent of hours between the two countries did not carry out the next day &apos;s transactions .
Estonia and Latvia circu@@ lated 99 % of the time from Estonia to Latvia and 73 % of the hours used the full transmission capacity .
on the Nas@@ da@@ q OM@@ X market , which took place on the last trading day in July , the price of the electricity stock exchange could be around EUR 34 and EUR 37 per hour in September .
carbon prices affecting electricity production increased last month and transactions were between EUR 5.@@ 04 and EUR 5.@@ 47 per tonne .
high life - half @-@ dec@@ re@@ es and cle@@ ver de@@ sig@@ ners have made it the home of the small Ear@@ ls Court flat rate
Jo@@ anne Le@@ igh , a former ban@@ ker who is a passion@@ ate real estate innova@@ tor , changed his great home of K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to the Ear@@ ls Court flat in 2014 .
it is located on the first order of Qu@@ e@@ en Anne steel , and the fact that Jo@@ anne has not pac@@ ked her bags and sold the flat is a tribute to the new design .
&quot; before that , I lived on a much larger soil in K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge , a former partner of life . &quot; said Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I looked for something that would be the equivalent of the price I offered .
I was told that Ear@@ ls Court flat and had the same high wa@@ re@@ houses .
I lo@@ ved it and made an offer the same day . &quot;
since its first visit , this 93 @-@ square me@@ tre flat has gone through a complete innova@@ tor .
to get a s@@ lee@@ ping room and a complicated one @-@ stop @-@ shop : a kit@@ chen wal@@ ked through to get a s@@ le@@ ep , Jo@@ anne wanted to include savings and half @-@ order to exploit high @-@ quality disco@@ veries .
&quot; I wanted high @-@ level inven@@ tions , big win@@ dows , a lot of light .
those were my demands , &apos; he said .
he asked Er@@ fan Az@@ adi N@@ ot@@ ting from the archite@@ ctural and de@@ sig@@ ner radio Du@@ ck &amp; D in order to take advantage of the 3.@@ 8 m de@@ ser@@ t and create a home , not just as an object of development but as a place where Jo@@ anne could live .
it was not high enough to add two areas to each other , so the archite@@ ctural challenge was to create half @-@ order where you could stand .
Er@@ fan has had to take a creative approach .
&quot; construction is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we have had to re@@ organise the premises so that they are on each other without having to bo@@ w down .
it was not just about building a platform , but about using steel construction to get it right at the he@@ ight of both the upper and the lower space . &quot;
it has made it possible for Er@@ fan@@ o to create two full @-@ e@@ ars in the room with a lot of dramatic elements on one side .
from an old age @-@ old light to the R@@ et@@ rou@@ vi@@ us window , an@@ thro@@ po@@ cen@@ tri@@ c housing will be opened up .
the gol@@ den fur@@ ni@@ ture , sil@@ ver details and the retro@@ spe@@ ctive Ser@@ ge M@@ ou@@ ille light highlight space style .
the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in the inclusion of theat@@ ric@@ ality , space and lighting .
mir@@ rors have been added to both sides of the short corridor to appear longer .
in the night , with the mir@@ ror , I have the impression of a second window opening the door .
during their introduction , a mir@@ ror retention site will be available to all gar@@ ments and glass requirements of Jo@@ anne .
the possibility of closing down vegetables if it is not used adds to housing , creating a more gla@@ mo@@ rous space .
Ac@@ cor@@ ding kit@@ ch@@ ens are nothing new .
however , what is unique in this kit@@ chen is the fact that we are dealing with an u@@ prising of a gar@@ age type .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at a bit of design work has gone into it &apos; explains the case of M@@ D@@ F , which has been spo@@ iled with a steel strengthening .
&apos;@@ This has a counter@@ weight and therefore uni@@ tes very simply to reject it &apos; .
thanks to smart use of space and savings , Jo@@ anne now has 16 extra metres , an additional s@@ lee@@ ping room and a better fla@@ x plan .
&quot; after all , a flo@@ til@@ la is what you sell - or what gives value to property - &apos; says Er@@ fan &apos; .
&apos;@@ The anch@@ ov@@ y s@@ tun@@ t takes an outdated form of tu@@ pp@@ y and makes calculations on the basis of the underground area &apos; .
here they have been able to increase the sur@@ ger@@ y , using high @-@ quality materials that add luxury to space .
&quot; the materials are what you are dealing with and thus help to bring about an emotional link with your homes , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&apos;@@ You do not love electricity cable in the wall .
it is important , but does not call heart languages . &quot;
this shows that good design and increased area are helping to do something quite ama@@ zing about the common cor@@ ps .
in fact , they may even give rise to a desire not to leave , as was the case with Jo@@ anne .
chief figure , Sir Jen@@ sen , is a ke@@ y@@ stone running in Ch@@ ic@@ ago &apos;s s@@ tun@@ t , in competition with a colleague for professional res@@ en@@ tment .
it does not read anything other than the amount of money that has been earned , without which any ethics is forgotten .
a man of her wife and her three children can only see her hus@@ band in a thi@@ ef and late night .
in the first half of the film , I de@@ em myself thinking that this is the &apos; House of Com@@ m@@ ons &apos; business world - even K@@ ev@@ in S@@ pac@@ ks and Ger@@ ard Bu@@ tle@@ r &apos;s spokes@@ man@@ e@@ er are similar .
however , the more film goes on , the less hard@@ ware element remains , and the mor@@ alising intention of film @-@ makers is becoming increasingly apparent .
a life @-@ changing experience will mean that the main figure will be cancer in the bo@@ y .
the choice now has to be made between work and family life .
the de@@ sp@@ icable po@@ et makes the father think about the great buildings of Ch@@ ic@@ ago in his wal@@ king visits about things that are really important , such as religion , well @-@ being , love ... , without tou@@ ching even on the disaster of the twin tow@@ ers .
after a third st@@ oma@@ ch where a son opens his eyes , there is a feeling that film @-@ makers are well on the basis of the aim of being able to le@@ cture audi@@ ences , because even the most ob@@ ses@@ sive specta@@ tor is unable to hold back te@@ ars in the face of the suffering of a lo@@ vely cancer bo@@ y .
when the son falls into the ba@@ g and his situation looks almost hope@@ less , the father understands once and for all the mor@@ als of his work and makes the old man in search of ch@@ arity .
now I am taking a layer with myself : if a film has interoperability , I will reward my fore@@ sight after a film &apos;s coff@@ ee , if I am wrong , then at least one surprise can be commen@@ ded on the sustainability of the cas@@ ino .
for a moment , there is a suspicion that you will lose your seat - when your hus@@ band will call a sick person and the man will dri@@ ft down the route of a corridor in slow motion .
the bo@@ y has , after all , been mira@@ cul@@ ously healthy , and even though his father has just lost his job , it will also prove to be positive , because now is the time to deal with the family .
I , too , feel comfortable - I can already predict the end of the American dra@@ ma quite well !
in truth , the film is well designed ; all the elements are there .
you can take the but@@ ton , you can lau@@ gh , the actors are a good and moral beau@@ ty : money is not the most important thing in life .
I am surprised that the film is coming in well .
the new staff Com@@ man@@ der intends to limit the President &apos;s media consumption .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps Mr Kelly will actually manage it .
he would then be the first one .
Poli@@ tic@@ o wri@@ tes that the new staff com@@ man@@ der of the White House intends to limit President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in &apos;s flow of information , including news , in the hope that it will keep the water in a more balanced manner .
here is Jo@@ h D@@ aw@@ se@@ y repor@@ ter :
&apos;@@ W@@ hen John F@@ . Kelly met high officials on his first working day in the White House , he pointed out the key problem facing President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i in the White House , which he plans to resolve through the transfer of dis@@ information to the President .
Mr Kelly told officials that the information must go through him , whether on paper or in meetings , because the President would make better decisions if he was given good information . &quot;
Mr Kelly &apos;s diagnosis seems perfectly logical , but others have tried to do so and have failed to monitor T@@ ru@@ p &apos;s media consumption .
President T@@ ru@@ p &apos;s relationship with television reaches decades and , even now that he is in the White House , his television watching habits have gone nowhere .
&apos;@@ I@@ f the candidate , Mr T@@ ru@@ mp , was anno@@ yed to show him that he had been fairly reflected in the pres@@ ti@@ gious publications &apos; said the former campaig@@ ner , S@@ am N@@ un@@ berg , in February to Poli@@ ti@@ co .
Poli@@ tic@@ o Füle wrote at the time that &apos; six former campaig@@ ners say that T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter driving is key to ensuring that his private media consumption includes a stable s@@ ong of praise &apos; .
very well .
but the idea that T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter used habits have ever been &apos; under control &apos; is ridiculous .
perhaps those campaig@@ ners know something that the rest of us do not know about interoperability T@@ ru@@ p &apos;s ro@@ of@@ s would have been even more hear@@ tening without their interventions .
we will probably never get to know about the charges that T@@ ru@@ mp did not post .
when his hel@@ ple@@ ss was able to save him even a few times the trouble , their efforts were worth it .
but no one has been able to prevent T@@ ru@@ p from continually sti@@ r@@ ring up controversy .
part of the problem is that in the White House , which is made up of competing cli@@ cks , people are trying , without exception , to promote their own interests by transferring material to T@@ ru@@ h which supports their views on the world stage but may not always be credible .
in May , Poli@@ tic@@ o , which reflects the whole story &apos;s course , the advis@@ ers &apos; le@@ an@@ ings to the President of the feed , wrote strategically questionable information .
one of the examples described by the repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ ma@@ cher is :
&quot; current and former T@@ ru@@ mp@@ ers are saying that T@@ ru@@ mp can react to negative press pressures , particularly adverse effects on le@@ aks , explo@@ sive by taking the ob@@ session with identifying their source of origin .
this also happened at the end of February , when someone was happy to give the President his printed copy of an Internet provo@@ ca@@ tor , Charles C. The Joh@@ n@@ son website of G@@ ot@@ New@@ s.@@ Net , a de@@ pu@@ tising de@@ pu@@ der of staff , Ka@@ tie Wal@@ sh@@ i , accused of being the &apos; source of several le@@ aks &apos; of the White House .
it does not matter that Joh@@ n@@ son has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of mo@@ cking , or that he has not provided any concrete evidence , or has made false accusations and has withdrawn them in the past .
the T@@ ru@@ mp read the article and began to qu@@ ery Wales under the car@@ pet . &quot;
Gold@@ ma@@ cher added that Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , the then head of staff com@@ man@@ der Re@@ ince Pri@@ eb@@ us and Head of the White House office , had tried to put in place a system to manage and document documents reaching T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in . &quot;
how did it work ?
Mr Kelly is trying to do exactly the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader , but T@@ ru@@ mp remains an impul@@ se and his assis@@ tant will continue to compete in the name of influence .
these un@@ changing factors make the Kelly mission very difficult .
street mus@@ ici@@ ans coming from abroad will not get permission to speak .
in the centre of Tallinn , there is a great deal of ali@@ ens going on .
those with whom the con@@ spi@@ ra@@ cy had spoken acknowledged that it was playing in the old town without the permission of the city &apos;s administration .
the first were three street mus@@ ici@@ ans who had taken the same number of do@@ gs with them in close proximity to the Vir@@ u gates .
it was clear that mus@@ ici@@ ans with r@@ hy@@ th@@ ms and explo@@ sive clo@@ thes were in ab@@ sen@@ tia migrants , who would have to spend one sho@@ wer mar@@ ching .
despite the violence , the only woman in the company played a ru@@ th@@ less r@@ hy@@ th@@ m in a@@ cor@@ di@@ on , while one man , next to her three bal@@ ls , called him closer to the fur@@ ni@@ ture .
a third man had sta@@ yed in one house alongside them and smo@@ ked a war@@ mer self @-@ proclaimed ag@@ glom@@ er@@ ations .
their three cha@@ mbers did not allow themselves to be distur@@ bed by a passing people .
Mr Bo@@ b , who played on the A@@ cor@@ di@@ on with No@@ emi and the bal@@ ls , said that he was we@@ aring in the streets for both fu@@ n and money .
the purpose of the exercise was to collect the ticket price for a ship travelling to Finland the same day in the evening .
the question as to whether they were asking for permission in the old city for pat@@ ron@@ ising was sha@@ king No@@ emi and Bo@@ b &apos;s head .
firstly , we did not know .
secondly , we will never stand in one city for more than a day , a few , and most of them will be granted permits for a month or something like that .
there is no point paying for this , &apos; explained Bo@@ b .
when we got back to the Vir@@ u gates about 20 minutes later , we saw that two women are at mus@@ ici@@ ans and are driving them to go .
this exhibition , with its bags and its do@@ ck@@ ta@@ ils , pic@@ ked up a test of happ@@ iness at the site of the Vir@@ u Centre .
there were also three Polish youn@@ g@@ sters on the Vir@@ u street , one of whom was playing sign , the other was ch@@ lar@@ ing , and the third had even carried an electronic glass .
&quot; we &apos;@@ re here to give people a feeling of enter@@ tainment to spread music and joy and to earn money for fuel and living , &quot; explained the tri@@ o of the pi@@ pe M@@ iv@@ os@@ h .
according to M@@ iv@@ o@@ sh@@ i , they are aware that the city authorities must be allowed to speak .
&apos;@@ We do not have it of course &apos; , he said so jo@@ king .
but we hope that when people enjoy our music , there will be no problem at all .
of course , when the police come , we go elsewhere but have to try &apos; , he added .
the Estonian Central Bank purchased EUR 149 million in bonds in July as part of a public asset buying programme of central banks in the euro area , while the central bank bonds portfolio increased to a total of EUR 4.@@ 36 billion .
the Central Bank does not publish more detailed information on purchases .
Har@@ do H@@ ans@@ son , President of the Bank of Estonia , has previously explained , in response to a request from members of the National Assembly , that the Euro@@ system &apos;s plan for the assets of central banks consists of three different purchasing programmes : covered bonds ( interoperability ) , asset @-@ backed bonds ( A@@ B@@ S ) and public bonds ( PS@@ PP ) .
the Central Bank is buying up bonds from the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere .
these purchases will lead to lower @-@ risk asset productivity and will motivate investors to take increased risks .
as a general rule , each central bank bu@@ ys its own government bonds in the framework of its public bond purchasing programme , while other government bonds are not purchased .
as the Estonian State has not issued bonds , the Estonian Central Bank is making so @-@ called substitu@@ tion purchases within the amount allocated to them .
the central banks are also buying up in countries where the offer of debt corresponding to the purchase scheme is limited .
according to Mr H@@ ans@@ son , the Bank of Estonia generally bu@@ ys European institution bonds , such as European Financial Stability Fund bonds and European Investment Bank bonds .
the Bank of Estonia will purchase bonds under its asset buying programme from March 2015 .
in the meantime , Ele@@ circu@@ late bonds were also obtained , but in June 2016 , the Estonian bank will no longer buy Ele@@ circu@@ it bonds .
on behalf of the central banks of the euro area , both the Central Bank of Finland will buy energy bonds from Ele@@ ring and Estonia from June onwards .
migrants ignore degrees and return to the &quot; mil@@ li@@ on@@ set of millions of businesses . &quot;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est owners of the West Mid@@ lands have once again found themselves in a fier@@ ce confrontation with determined travellers , who have ignored the du@@ mp du@@ mped by the coun@@ ty to win back away from their cotton .
migrants have flo@@ wn their 20 tra@@ i@@ ler f@@ ences on the streets of a prosperous &quot; millions of businesses &quot; cros@@ sed by the So@@ meat ul@@ l .
they have returned with the army of hor@@ ses , children and lorries after they were thrown out there only in May without being thrown away from the bureaucracy du@@ mped to prevent their invasion by the Council .
the group found a weak position in the protective limits , turning its vehicles from an un@@ blocked part left over by wal@@ king .
there are some cle@@ ric@@ al residents who have fle@@ w to the So@@ meat Council saying that the Council is &apos; useless in dealing with the problem &apos; .
an anon@@ ymous resident said , &apos; The@@ y of Ben@@ tle@@ y He@@ ath@@ an , who st@@ oned the fur@@ ni@@ ture on Monday evening after being expelled , &apos; .
the Council must be embarras@@ sed to take action because they are useless in dealing with the problem .
the migrants were there in May , they were forced to go and now they are back again .
more came yesterday evening , more probably today . &quot;
he added : &apos; Bir@@ min@@ g@@ ha@@ m Council knows how to deal with such matters by obtaining long barriers to protect its par@@ ks .
I live on the street and I am not satisfied that I have to continue to pay the G@@ over@@ ning Board if the Council cannot even prevent such a thing from happening . &quot;
a resident who also wanted to remain anon@@ ymous said : &apos; it is ridiculous ; we have just seen how the latter left these travellers , and a new on@@ s@@ lau@@ ght is already under way .
this time the number has risen and the horse has even ru@@ ined in the grass@@ land . &quot;
the representative of the So@@ meat Council said , &apos; We are aware that the land near the street eth@@ s@@ bro@@ o@@ k road is an unacceptable camp pla@@ te and we are working with the So@@ meat ul@@ l police ; we are taking the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible .
the gathering of evidence will be very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any antis@@ o@@ cial or criminal behaviour to the police by phone 101 .
this will help to create a picture of the situation for the Court when we present the case . &quot;
the We@@ ek@@ end festi@@ val will be visited by Minister for Culture , In@@ dre@@ k Sa@@ ar , among others , who is pleased that it has been possible to bring real top names to Estonia .
the question as to why it is so important for Est@@ oni@@ ans on the We@@ ek@@ end festi@@ val is that it should be asked by all those who enjoy it in full for three days at the F@@ esti@@ val .
what he says , however , is that real players have arrived in Per@@ sia .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen you look at the level of artists that has been brought to Estonia , the absolute top names of this mus@@ ical j@@ uni@@ or are brought home - which often does not happen in our body &apos; , the Minister for Culture is speaking .
which artists in the festi@@ val are speaking the most about Sa@@ art itself ?
I consider myself to be a relatively old and , for people like mine , one of the most experienced doctors , Ar@@ min van B@@ ava@@ re@@ n , who stood up yesterday evening .
after all , at some point in time , all of us - and I quote - have got their feet on their own feet . &quot;
he does , however , highlight a number of other names , such as Cha@@ in@@ solidarity , De@@ ad@@ ma@@ u@@ 5 , K@@ ni@@ fe@@ din .
of course , our own Estonian players too : starting with NO@@ MO@@ P , they can be read in a whole series .
in reality , the concentration of names known as &apos; is very high &apos; , he says .

up to 850 000 diesel vehicles are being upgra@@ ded by car manufacturers in the midst of criticism
the day before the Au@@ di announcement , B@@ M@@ W said it would offer software coverage to over 350 000 vehicles .
the B@@ M@@ W Chairman said that the company believes that &apos; there are more intelligent alternatives than driving restrictions &apos; , referring to European cities , including the home city of B@@ M@@ W , Munich , which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles .
Da@@ im@@ ler announced on Tuesday that he will renew 3 million Mercedes &apos;s vehicles in Europe to reduce emissions from diesel engines .
they were not described by any company as a re @-@ sum@@ mon@@ ing .
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions .
however , nitrogen ox@@ ide em@@ itted from diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and can cause as@@ th@@ ma .
at the same time , the cost of equipment intended to neutr@@ alise gas emissions from diesel vehicles will increase for the automotive industry , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
while German car manufacturers are under thorough investigation , Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s government is being accused of le@@ c@@ turing the powerful car manufacturers and of ignoring the signs of the problem .
companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of the Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen Agency , which has remained silent about the use of so @-@ called &apos; sca@@ m devices &apos; , which made it possible to adapt the exha@@ ust gases to the regulations at the time of testing a car , but have returned to normal driving conditions .
several heads of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen have been indi@@ cted in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , a former head of the Au@@ di engine Development unit was arrested in Germany .
former President Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Gi@@ o@@ van@@ ni Pa@@ mi@@ o is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may be prosecuted in the United States .
earlier this year , Au@@ di , in Germany , was drawn into a criminal investigation into Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen , where the authorities accused the audit system of being installed in order to circum@@ vent European emissions requirements , thereby extending the investigation , which had previously been focused on the United States .
the inclusion of the prize in the investigation may be a major blow to the Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen Agency by a manufacturer of connected luxury cars generating a disproportionate share of the Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen profits .
the Estonian schools are acquiring the European Union &apos;s flags at EUR 20 000 .
the Estonian Ministry of Education intends to purchase the flags of the European Union to mark the Presidency by 1 September .
in total , the EU flag of 5@@ 70 educational institutions will be measured by 105@@ x@@ 15@@ 8 c@@ enti@@ metres .
they are intended to be ex@@ hi@@ b@@ iting in in@@ door spaces and must also be carried out in high @-@ quality printed material in@@ doors with an at@@ testa@@ tion , an ER@@ R news portal .
there is a text on the simple label : &apos; confirmation of the Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union .
the estimated cost of 5@@ 70 flags is EUR 20 000 at the Ministry of Education &apos;s price ; one flag costs EUR 35 .
journalist murder highlights growing danger in Mexico
week @-@ old Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers usually gather on Wednesday to review plans for the most recent chaos in the Blue State , so@@ wn by organised crime , corrupt officials and un@@ ce@@ asing drugs wars .
but today , under the gu@@ ise of a personal tragedy , they have gathered to discuss their own security .
they are being told that it is important to change their ru@@ ins .
two senior wri@@ ters discuss which seems safer : either to bring children with them into an office that was the target of a gran@@ dio@@ se attack in 2009 or to leave them at home .
security experts have written three words to the &apos; enemies &apos; , &apos; neutral &apos; , &apos; allies &apos; .
they are asking repor@@ ters for every ve@@ ctor &apos;s names to provide live proof , they are sufficient impres@@ sions and in@@ ner feelings .
the presence of a government or a car@@ tel is suspected of acting on behalf of drug traffickers , politicians , busines@@ spe@@ ople and journalists , who make it dangerous for the chaos in Mexico to be reflected .
violence is not a b@@ reat@@ h of b@@ reat@@ h , and the more deaths are accumu@@ lating across the country , the greater the proportion of which journalists make up , according to the Committee for the Protection of Solidarity journalists , since President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Len@@ to was e@@ rec@@ ted in December 2012 , at least 25 : 5@@ 89 journalists have been killed since attacks and threats under national protection , and this year at least seven journalists in seven states have still died .
the latest fatalities include their edit@@ or and source of inspiration , co @-@ foun@@ der of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den .
&apos;@@ The greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist &apos; wrote Val@@ dez in one of its many books on drug violence .
his absence is deeply felt , even though his presence may be felt throughout the morning of the associate Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Bu@@ il@@ ding , a big picture of a finger @-@ pointing Val@@ de@@ z with a letter of &apos; fairness &apos; and two of the 30@@ s reports , A@@ ar@@ on I@@ bar@@ ra and M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez , carry T @-@ shir@@ ts with a face of his s@@ mil@@ l @-@ like specta@@ cles , or their characteristic bankers .
Re@@ por@@ ters discuss the common trau@@ ma , their n@@ ight@@ m@@ are , dre@@ ams , paran@@ o@@ ia .
although a separate Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists &apos; cases , only two cases have been brought before the Committee for the Protection of journalists .
like most annual assassin@@ ations involving drug trafficking and organised crime , the number of which ran@@ ges to thousands , journalists &apos; kil@@ lers are rarely brought to justice .
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s edit@@ orial activities will continue to reflect the violence in Sin@@ al@@ os , even though their hearts have been broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous .
without murde@@ rers &apos; data and justice , I@@ bar@@ ra says that a meeting on security is of little use .
&apos;@@ It is very stu@@ pid to waste your time at this meeting , &apos; he says .
&apos;@@ as long as the cause is not known , you will trust everyone &apos; .
Val@@ dez left the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce office in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , State capital , on the morning of 15 May .
he was able to travel only a few quarters before he was hal@@ ted by two men by Red To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Co@@ rol@@ la ; he was forced to leave the car and was shot 12 times , presu@@ ma@@ bly because of the name of the newspaper , which trans@@ lates as &apos; the twel@@ f@@ th river &apos; .
an armed man went out in the car of Val@@ dez and made an accident in the vic@@ inity of it .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
she and two adult children were left behind .
the rum@@ ours circu@@ late freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
however , there is basically only silence on the Val@@ dez issue .
since the arrest of Gu@@ z@@ man last year and the extradition in January of the United States of America , Blue authorisation has been one of the country &apos;s most bloody bat@@ tle@@ fields , as ri@@ val@@ ries are fighting to fill a power vacuum .
it does not matter that , on the streets of the blue licence , a person or even several people are shot down every day , or that the ce@@ me@@ teries are ri@@ d@@ den up from the dou@@ bly dec@@ or@@ ated double drug k@@ ings , which are greater than many homes living .
let us forget for a moment that the time for peace indicates just one car@@ tel running at sea with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States .
despite all this and the fact that Val@@ dez was fully aware of the dangers of its work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , co @-@ foun@@ der and chairman of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce ( 60 ) , feels deeply innocent that he was unable to protect his friend .
he believes that the killing was facilitated by two mistakes .
the first was the publication in February of an interview with Mr D@@ amas@@ o L@@ ope@@ z , a car@@ tel that is in competition with and is in war with the sons of Gu@@ z@@ man .
this piece of correspon@@ dence may have been allu@@ ded to by the gan@@ gs who are suspi@@ cious , buying all the cop@@ ies of the publication as soon as they got into the shel@@ ves of the newspaper .
the second mistake was that Val@@ dez was not forced to leave his country in the name of his own security after the crackdown took place in another newspaper delivery that reflected the same story .
Val@@ dez was a leg@@ end , both in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico .
he had survi@@ ved for so long that his friends and colleagues had assumed that he would be there forever .
he worked as a ve@@ ter@@ an@@ repor@@ ter at No@@ ro@@ es in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , selling 50 @-@ dollar parts .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said that in Sin@@ al@@ o &apos; it was impossible to deal with the press without tou@@ ching the drug problem &apos; .
the newspaper took a long time to know with its courageous and honest reports , and sales and advertising increased .
Re@@ por@@ ters lo@@ ved to express vigorous studies without any fear of censorship and read@@ ers in a fasc@@ in@@ ating publication from which they could read stories that no one else da@@ red to report .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the newspaper won a pres@@ ti@@ gious Maria Mo@@ ors C@@ ab@@ ot Prize for her Latin American refle@@ ctions .
in the same year , the Committee for the Protection of journalists in Val@@ dez ( AK@@ K ) won the International Press Freedom Prize for its courage to follow the Mexic@@ an drug story wherever it leads .
he openly admitted that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to live on , &quot; he said when he received the AK@@ K prize .
last October , he told the television channel Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ en@@ to in an interview that drug trafficking was a way to live in Sin@@ al@@ o@@ a .
&quot; to embrace the challenge that journalists &apos; office has to face now is to play fu@@ n .
I do not want to be asked what I did or why I did not say what was going on in the face of so many deaths . &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce colle@@ gi@@ ate long for a teacher of Val@@ dez , a jo@@ ke who , like a mad@@ ness , a friend who kind@@ ly shared embry@@ os and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they supported his rou@@ tine .
he was always we@@ aring his bar@@ rel .
he moved from the office to El Guatem@@ y@@ ab@@ o bar and was always on the same s@@ ong .
now they are asking whether his rou@@ tine love became fatal .
his death has also made them question how best to do his job and stay alive .
&quot; they do not like the ri@@ gi@@ d@@ ity of their women , their children , their legitimate businesses , with their secret landing pla@@ tes used to transport drugs . &quot;
&apos;@@ Th@@ ese things should not be touched , &apos; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result will be strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ estee@@ m even in the best times .
trust in your in@@ st@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sme@@ ars suspi@@ ci@@ ously , it do@@ es@@ n &apos;t .
according to the edit@@ or of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , And@@ res Vil@@ lar@@ rez , the problem is that &apos; the fra@@ gran@@ ce can be dece@@ ived ... and that is how it happened with the J@@ any . &apos;
he and others are saying that the old rules no longer apply in M@@ al@@ os , just as they do not apply in Ta@@ ma@@ u@@ li@@ pa@@ sis , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Guer@@ re@@ ros or other states that are home to the toxic composition of lu@@ cra@@ tive smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt state officials .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the space where Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers met for security training , mobile phones were suddenly no longer permitted ; a few days before that , it was revealed that only a but@@ ton sold to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
two poli@@ ce@@ men se@@ ar@@ ched to the house under the gu@@ ise of the t@@ ree reli@@ ev@@ ing a 40 degree bul@@ let .
they have been appointed by the Government to the post of office of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , situated in a four @-@ point building in the centre of the Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an neighbourhood .
some repor@@ ters won@@ dered half @-@ jo@@ king whether these police officers are among the 50 % police officers that the Governor himself has dis@@ credi@@ ted .
several months have el@@ ap@@ sed since the repor@@ ters have travelled to mountainous areas where the control is de facto in the hands of drug gan@@ gs .
Mr Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s publication this week covered three main a@@ xes .
one of them was the murder of former bo@@ xing leg@@ end , Ju@@ li@@ o Lamber@@ ar Cha@@ vez ven@@ na , in Sin@@ al@@ o@@ a .
in addition , they had a reve@@ aling story of government money being spent on the town of govern@@ or &apos;s home town .
and people were kidna@@ pped by one of the most expensive restaur@@ ant groups , from Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an to Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , from a c@@ abinet .
there was no official announcement of who was kidna@@ pped or how this happened , so caution had to be exercised when it came to writing what all cities knew as a place for drug traffickers and public authorities .
the repor@@ ter learned from the public documents that the restaur@@ ant has been registered as a politician who belongs to the ruling institution , the Rev@@ olu@@ tionary Party ( IR@@ P ) , which dominated all levels of policy for almost the whole last century .
more recently , several IR@@ P govern@@ or has been accused of corruption in court cases on a large scale .
in Vil@@ lar@@ real , the repor@@ ter asked him to write previous incidents in the same place , including how the son of Gu@@ z@@ man , who is we@@ aring the name of El Chap@@ o , esca@@ ped a military record .
only a few months earlier , read@@ ers would have been looking to Val@@ dez &apos;s co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il to obtain information on kid@@ napp@@ ings from the best sources .
&apos;@@ In the past we would have already known what happened , &apos; said Vil@@ lar@@ line , 46 years old , whose bro@@ ker &apos;s body construction deserves a sh@@ ou@@ ting name , El Fla@@ co .
&quot; now all channels of communication have broken down with our sources . &quot;
the Val@@ dez office has become savings on labels and stic@@ kers protesting against the killing of journalists , and the edit@@ orial staff have become something they could never expect in the name of the press .
Re@@ por@@ ter M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez pic@@ ked a few eyes and moved to the local public Prosecutor &apos;s c@@ abinet next morning for yet another journalist &apos;s sake .
in the western state of Mic@@ ho@@ ac@@ an , Mr Salvador A@@ bad comes three days after the massacre in Val@@ dez .
a dead body has been bur@@ nt and , according to the officials , it belongs on the basis of DNA tests .
journalists across the country have become more vo@@ cal and highlight the words &apos; S@@ OS press &apos; as an organised protest against th@@ ug@@ s and buildings .
on that day President Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez will be in Washington in an attempt to gather international support in the Val@@ dez case to get justice right .
the day after the death of Val@@ dez in meetings with the Governor of S@@ mit@@ ry , the Ra@@ mi@@ rez authorities accused journalists of c@@ rying and killing them of telling the truth .
since then , he asked that he be diver@@ ted from government activity by concern that he had an influence on his objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that Mexic@@ an journalists were &apos; constra@@ ined &apos; by organised crime , compli@@ cit state officials and an indifferent society .
in his most recent book , &apos; Drugs press &apos; , he wrote that repor@@ ters not only kill drugs gan@@ gs , but also at the be@@ h@@ est of politicians and security forces , who are in contact with organised crime .
the media monitoring group Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 awarded more than half of the attacks by journalists to the police and state officials last year .
&quot; in Mexico you connect because you want to keep quiet , &quot; said Ra@@ mi@@ rez .
murder obviously has a bloody effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ g@@ ger Maria E@@ liz@@ abeth Ma@@ ci@@ as in the northern border state of Ta@@ ma@@ u@@ li@@ pa@@ sis six years ago .
his body was found together with a letter , probably signed by the car@@ tel L@@ OS Z@@ e@@ tas : &apos; I am here for my reports &apos; .
she had a computer ke@@ y@@ stone and head@@ phones alongside her de@@ ser@@ ted head .
some ou@@ tle@@ ts have decided to close their doors , for example in the northern border state of El Nor@@ te in Chi@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ a , following the killing by March of their correspon@@ dence , Mrs B@@ org@@ h .
others are dra@@ gging on as they did in 2004 , following the murder of their President of El Man@@ ana de Nu@@ ev@@ o L@@ are@@ do .
in 2010 , the newspaper Di@@ ari@@ o de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z spoke in public to the drug car@@ tel with the headline &apos; What do you want ? &apos;
some journalists have fled to their home states or even to their own country .
it is a ner@@ v@@ ous decision .
it is difficult to find a job in exile and they still have to han@@ g onto the streets in order to avoid dangers .
and sometimes they are being hun@@ ted behind , as is probably the case with the photo@@ graphic Ru@@ be@@ n E@@ sp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 at a Mexico corridor with four women , three months after Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z had fled .
those who remain in place and continue to work will have to dance around the risky decisions on a daily basis .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to become a po@@ et , ad@@ mits that reporting drugs trafficking sca@@ res him .
&quot; Mexico is on its way to hell , and that is why I am going to report , &apos; she said .
in a recent mid@@ night on Friday , when the latest number had already gone down , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce ed@@ itors sta@@ yed on a th@@ or@@ n in front of the office and loo@@ ted a be@@ er when it suddenly began to cal@@ ib@@ rate all phones .
in Ma@@ z@@ at@@ lan@@ is , a ri@@ val city of ri@@ val gan@@ gs and security forces , 19 people were killed by confirmed data in the fire @-@ fighting between the ri@@ val gan@@ gs .
the war es@@ c@@ ala@@ ted , just as many of the messages left to them by the car@@ tels found in the region also promised .
on the basis of the same hard line , the repor@@ ters pic@@ ked up the news on the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce website using a mobile phone .
the front of next day needed to be changed .
the ra@@ mi@@ fications hu@@ m@@ bled along the lines of a new exchange of fire in the region .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez pa@@ ved towards on @-@ call police officers to see whether they are vigilant .
if they fea@@ red it , they did not at least show it .
under the massive t@@ ree of the de@@ scen@@ dant of the newspaper , where his average finger can be seen for the whole of his S@@ ho@@ p , the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers carried his foot@@ steps in his foot@@ steps .
&apos;@@ Ho@@ w can one ever think of closing down &apos; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &apos; when on the very day Javier killed , a tra@@ ine@@ e asked me to send him to the street to report ? &apos;
D@@ in@@ sid@@ ur@@ se used defence col@@ ours to prevent enemies
at first g@@ lance , it looks like a form , albeit rather frigh@@ tening .
scientists have now made public the first findings regarding the un@@ beli@@ evable pre@@ valence of r@@ all@@ ot@@ ry size discovered by the Canadian min@@ er , which has survi@@ ved so well that the experts have described it as &apos; a Lis@@ at of the din@@ departments Mon@@ a . &apos;
it has survi@@ ved so well that it was even possible to establish that the sk@@ in covered by his soya was the colour of the bun@@ ch @-@ box Brown and his past had been somewhat &apos; complicated &apos; .
the present Bi@@ ology report described the status quo as &apos; the best @-@ preserved piece of gender pressure ever found &apos; and when &apos; one of the best members of the world is best &apos; .
fossil is a new type of no@@ do@@ sa@@ ic pressure that lived in the middle of the cri@@ cket era , 110 @-@ 112 million years ago .
the incredibly good maintenance of this was provided by theat@@ res who describe it as &apos; truly remarkable &apos; .
this her@@ bal food is the best preserved type of ph@@ os@@ ph@@ orus that has ever been found , according to the National Ge@@ o@@ transmission magaz@@ ine .
it was found on 21 March 2011 when he extra@@ cted the Sun@@ c@@ or Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um mining in For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray near Northern Albertini in Canada .
he struck something that did not remember the th@@ read around him and decided to look into it in greater detail .
the detected ph@@ os@@ ph@@ orus was sent to the Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell Pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ology M@@ use@@ um .
for the next six years , an animal has been working to extra@@ ct 2 500 Nazi ( 1 100 kilometres ) from a piece of land .
after all the hard work , the end result is now finally ready to be made public .
&apos;@@ I@@ f a bit of a bridge is tor@@ n up , one can hardly believe that he is s@@ le@@ ep , &apos; said the leader , Cal@@ e@@ b Brown , the scien@@ tist Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell muse@@ um , where the present is expon@@ ential .
&apos;@@ Th@@ rou@@ gh will go down in scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved members of the din@@ osa , Mon@@ a Lis@@ ana . &apos;
in his investigation into lea@@ ther , he found that this animal feed , although covered by soya and re@@ minis@@ cent of a wal@@ king tan@@ k , was likely to be significantly threatened by feed pressure .
this cur@@ few so@@ cks used a red and white shel@@ f to hide from pre@@ da@@ tors and applied shel@@ ters technology , which is called shelter and is also used by many today &apos;s animals .
this has allowed , as experts have said , the din@@ osa@@ ur to be better integrated around and the enemies avoided , because he is likely to be hun@@ ted down by the major cur@@ ve .
this 110 million @-@ year @-@ old family of no@@ do@@ main@@ s first entered the news in May and is now visiting the Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell Pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ology M@@ use@@ um .
the theat@@ re has now studied being and given the name to it by the Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta Mar@@ mit@@ hel@@ l M@@ use@@ um mark Mitchell , a famous team that took more than 7 000 hours to un@@ cover the lab@@ ori@@ ous reve@@ aling .
thanks to the ama@@ z@@ ingly good preservation of the father , Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the so@@ cks on the body .
they found an ab@@ er@@ ration - a common method of protection in the country of animal origin , which means that the ti@@ p of the existence was a dark port as a lower one .
although the shelter is ri@@ fe , the findings come as a surprise , since Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta is much larger than today live with over@@ sha@@ do@@ wed animals .
it suggests that the din@@ osa@@ ur me@@ al was sufficiently actively hun@@ ted by other animal feed sur@@ ger@@ y that the evolution preferred to be over@@ sha@@ do@@ wed instead of opposing the survival ta@@ ctic .
however , the majority of animals which use modern shel@@ ters - for example , fears , pig be@@ ans or sc@@ ars - are much smaller and more vulnerable as a sa@@ ga , which suggests that no@@ sa@@ ic pressure had to make a real effort to survive .
&apos;@@ A strong hun@@ t on the g@@ igan@@ tic g@@ rin@@ ding of the g@@ igan@@ tic presence of soya be@@ ans shows just how dangerous pre@@ da@@ tors may have been from the g@@ ho@@ sts of the cri@@ cket era , &apos; Brown said .

scientists will continue to investigate this life , including the content of this war@@ mon@@ gering style , in order to find out what the animal is going to eat in their last wave of war .
they believe that the din@@ osa@@ ur has plun@@ ged the river to death , thus ending up in a sea in which he has turned his back in front of the ocean bed .
at that time , Mr Albertini was as warm as he is today in southern Flor@@ ence , and rivers and oceans are likely to extend far beyond the internal area as they are today .
&quot; this no@@ do@@ sa@@ ic pressure is truly significant as it is fully covered by soya @-@ like sk@@ in , while also remaining three dimensions , preserving the original shape of the animal , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; as a result , today &apos;s animal looks almost the same as in the cri@@ cket era .
not very much imagination needs to be used to recon@@ stru@@ ct it - it is enough simply to te@@ ar our eyes on our eyes and it seems as if he is s@@ lee@@ ping . &apos;
the crisis era was the time when vast two leg@@ s of meat feed sur@@ ger@@ y - he@@ tero@@ gene@@ ous shops - were s@@ tun@@ ned on land .
although King Ty@@ ran@@ no@@ sa@@ ur@@ us re@@ x of all of them survi@@ ved millions of years later than Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta , some of his for@@ mi@@ dable predecess@@ ors could have been hun@@ ted down by this brea@@ th@@ taking cur@@ tain .
these include A@@ cro@@ can@@ tho@@ l , 38 leg@@ s ( 1@@ 1.5 metres ) in a long and six @-@ tonne mon@@ ster .
scientists whose recent findings are published in today &apos;s Bi@@ ology magaz@@ ine believe that Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta was dro@@ w@@ ned into the sea after death , and this fa@@ ci@@ v mu@@ tu@@ alised .
on 21 March 2011 , Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when mining in the Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um mine , For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray near Northern Albertini , discovered its validity in Canada .
according to the muse@@ um , it is the best preserved part of the world , including lea@@ ther and soya , and it is a complete concentration up to in@@ sec@@ tici@@ de .

how did one activist find an answer to the question &apos; whose thanks ? &apos;
on 9 August 2014 , Bri@@ t@@ tan@@ y Ferre@@ ll received full shock .
just one day after travelling to New York , it was father : St@@ Lou@@ is &apos;s resident , through his ren@@ ted room , on a phone line on Facebook .
he went on to the post of his former fellow country@@ man .
it reads : &apos; an 18 @-@ year @-@ old ad@@ ole@@ sc@@ ent has just been killed by the police and is still on the street &apos; .
he was confused as to why nobody else had posted this information on his stream , which is why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
P@@ ide@@ ga @ The@@ e@@ P@@ ha@@ ah &apos;s user &apos;s postal services had been distributed on several occasions along his time@@ line .
in real time , Michael Brown , an un@@ armed 18 @-@ year @-@ old black young man , killed by a white poli@@ ce@@ man in Fer@@ gus@@ oni Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is , was able to report the death of a sh@@ ining spar@@ k from the coun@@ ty of St@@ .
he wrote a picture of the life of Bro@@ w@@ n , a body that le@@ ak@@ ed on the street , remaining there for four hours .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at is cra@@ zy , &apos; said Ferre@@ ll &apos;s bro@@ thers .
but death was nothing new for him or for his community .
he put his phone off , but later this evening he re@@ saw the spar@@ k announced that people had gathered in Can@@ field D@@ ri@@ ve .
P@@ ho@@ tos of the police and the sh@@ ell@@ fish and the man who claimed to be Bro@@ w@@ ni &apos;s father and kept the label &apos; the Fer@@ gus@@ on police have just killed my un@@ armed son &apos; .
he looked in real time at the stream where the police officer stood before a group of prote@@ sters with a grave dog .
in another video , another poli@@ ce@@ man , he said , &apos; I kill you all ... animals &apos; .
Fer@@ rell is re@@ minis@@ cent of the way he caught himself in the idea : &apos; it is unusual &apos; .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at is not the kind of murder to which we are ac@@ custo@@ med and which we could describe as typical &apos; .
I felt frigh@@ tened at that point .
I was ang@@ ry and c@@ oo@@ ked &apos; .
he boo@@ ked a return flight and travelled home the following day .
having bu@@ ried at 23 o &apos;@@ clock , he went to his father for his six @-@ year @-@ old da@@ u@@ ghter and decided that they would be travelling to the tw@@ ist Fer@@ gus@@ on next morning .
what happened to Mr Fer@@ rell and Mr Fer@@ gus@@ on over the next three years will be the focus of a new docu@@ mentary &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street ? &apos; ( whom do you thank ? ) , which will be presented in cine@@ mas on 11 August .
this is about survival and protest , love and defeat , strength and fir@@ m@@ ness from the point of view of those people who live in this community and who , by demanding answers , took to the streets .
when Ferre@@ ll , along with a da@@ u@@ ghter - who had a flow@@ er bro@@ ker on his do@@ or@@ step and had a good k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les on it - was travelling to Fer@@ gus@@ on , they again talked about the experience and living conditions of the black men that they had repeatedly spoken about before this morning .
&apos;@@ D@@ o you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights ? &apos; it reminds itself of asking .
&apos;@@ We are currently travelling to Fer@@ gus@@ on because an 18 @-@ year @-@ old bo@@ y was killed by the police , and that is not right &apos; .
&apos;@@ I could not go along with him , &apos; said Ferre@@ ll later .
&apos;@@ What is happening now is ... the cul@@ mination of the past .
it must know and see this and grow in the middle of it .
she must learn about the organisation and organisation of an activist , while also knowing the different la@@ yers of experience and living conditions for the Muslims , and what we have to do to be free and free .
even if I succeed in bringing him up in such a way that he does not personally experience blatant racism , he is no different from some other black girls .
I feel I would be doing him a dis@@ service if I protected him from this world . &quot;
the first suspension they made when they reached Fer@@ gus@@ on was in South Flor@@ is@@ san@@ ti , a place on the way from the police station , which had become a kind of camp site where the activists were waiting for news about the police officer , Dar@@ re@@ n Wil@@ son , to be indi@@ cted in the end .
his da@@ u@@ ghter joined forces with local busines@@ spe@@ ople who made southern ski@@ es there .
they put together food bags and helped to distribute them to prote@@ sters .
for Fer@@ rell , a new type of activist has slowly begun to take shape .
&apos;@@ My activist changed completely after 9 August &apos; , he said , noting that when he was a student at Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i @-@ St@@ . Lou@@ is University , he was the President of the Association of National students on cancer and focused on food justice and health inequalities within Muslim communities .
&quot; I did not have any organisation experience .
it all just la@@ den . &apos;
two weeks later , Mrs Fo@@ la@@ yan@@ i , a film co @-@ director , met during the Ferre@@ ll evening demonstration .
Mr Fo@@ lay@@ an said that he and the film operator Lucas Al@@ var@@ ad@@ o @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r simply wanted to document what is going on .
in the face of Fer@@ rell , the question arises : &apos; are you going to try to document what is happening or to find a story that can be exploited ? &apos;
such scepticism was the result of countless cases where people - often white - come into the community and try to capita@@ lise on its fir@@ m@@ ness and fir@@ m@@ ness .
the Fo@@ lay@@ an explained in a recent interview : &apos; we have heard that the voice of people born in Fer@@ gus@@ on and growing up in Fer@@ gus@@ on will not be heard and we wanted to do so otherwise &apos; .
Fo@@ lay@@ an had already raised its hands with D@@ am@@ on Da@@ vis , the regional ar@@ tist known for an activist in connection with prisoners sentenced to death .
his involvement made the project attractive for Fer@@ rell and another six , who were watched for years by the W@@ ho@@ se street ? &apos; team following the shooting of Bro@@ w@@ n .
&apos;@@ In this docu@@ mentary , no one speaks for us , no one speaks for us , no one speaks to us , but for us , &apos; said Da@@ vis .
&apos;@@ It was important to me how these people were de@@ pic@@ ted , as that is how I am de@@ pic@@ ted &apos; .
although the aim was not to focus on the experience of Fer@@ rell - it was intended to show that the movement was not &apos; the head of sal@@ vation but the community coming together &apos; , as Mr Fo@@ lay@@ an said - he made the film the most open .
as a result , the &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street ? &apos; document surpris@@ ingly personal aspects of the life of Fer@@ rell , such as mer@@ cy and marriage with his wife .
&apos;@@ I felt as if I was na@@ ked , &apos; said Ferre@@ ll , s@@ mil@@ ing over the first time that he had seen a piece of urban work .
&quot; but I understood that there had to be a certain degree of vulnerability to do this work and to human@@ ise the black people . &quot;
what is more , the Fer@@ rell story underlines and puts the role of the black homo@@ sexual woman in the wider Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement at the centre again .
two of the three initi@@ ators of the movement who thought in the social media after the killing of the black teen@@ ag@@ er Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 are homo@@ sexual : # Bla@@ ck@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter .
&quot; in leading roles , black homo@@ sexual women have generally maintained the movement , &quot; said Ferre@@ ll , &quot; precisely because we have to fight on several fronts all the time .
Roma homo@@ sexual women must bear the full burden . &quot;
the Fo@@ lay@@ an agreed , stating that &apos; the movement is indeed kept alive by black women and many of them are black , homo@@ sexual women &apos; .
at the same time , he says that &apos; this is not a kind of matter of creating equal opportunities &apos; - Fer@@ rell was not the focus of the film chosen for his identity .
&apos;@@ H@@ e was a man from whom the right energy was le@@ an@@ ed &apos; he said .
&quot; but it is no coincidence that she was directly in the front@@ line because there is much at stake as a black homo@@ sexual woman living in such hu@@ bs .
his energy can be perceived on the screen . &quot;
at the same time , the news camer@@ as Fer@@ gus@@ on have long disappeared , but racial links between the community and the police are still fragile .
the conditional sentences imposed on Mr Fer@@ rell at the time of the demonstration for blocking the motor@@ way will last for another 2.5 years .
he describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere in the region he calls home as simply a &apos; huge free threat &apos; .
nevertheless , it still attaches great importance to the man@@ tra it has ea@@ ten since it first took to the streets of Fer@@ gus@@ on a full three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support one another .
we have nothing to lose except our chains . &quot;
7 examples of how to overcome from the We@@ ek@@ ent pi@@ pe po@@ pp@@ y
some of the more stu@@ b@@ born me@@ ters will find help after their me@@ ag@@ re gra@@ ves .
or by the saying &apos; avoid a po@@ mel@@ le , break a py@@ ra@@ mid &apos; .
but this is just the inevitable postponement and a proper ble@@ s@@ sing for health .
what can you do , after today &apos;s and tomorrow &apos;s We@@ ek@@ end trend - or other cur@@ ve - to feel better this morning and to get the bo@@ y out of it as pain@@ lessly as possible ?
Jo@@ o Water .
alcohol came down and down , after a great deal of pi@@ pe in the morning ... or , if possible , not even alcohol .
as the body loses a lot of liquids when it consu@@ mes alcohol , it must somehow be rec@@ ou@@ ped .
together with water , miner@@ als are also s@@ tun@@ ned out of the body , and the comp@@ ound is a good ha@@ ir &apos;s mineral water .
since the machine is often irri@@ tated after d@@ run@@ k , it is particularly good that it is soil @-@ free , or only ligh@@ tly pac@@ ked .
go and walk .
it would certainly not cost to go to the grand@@ mother to bur@@ y trees - that might be a fatal wrong decision .
but an easy process will help the body once again to remember what it is like to be alive .
S@@ hu@@ ff@@ ling and be@@ ating out a bo@@ y is a more time @-@ consuming way of getting healthy .
give the body energy back slowly and cau@@ ti@@ ously .
if you are already on track from yesterday &apos;s over@@ run , it will certainly not be worth trying to pay a heavy fat .
to begin with , for example , with the new volume in which the t@@ reas@@ ure t@@ reas@@ ure bodies are qui@@ et@@ ly placed .
if health around the South is already suffering , one could try the w@@ ed@@ ding , for example .
and a little later , a little bit later .
no coff@@ ee was issued .
this di@@ um will free its body from the last water .
as has already been said , water and volume have your friends .
contribute to pain@@ kil@@ lers .
if you take a pain@@ kil@@ ler this evening in order to prevent po@@ ison@@ ing , then you have to deal with not only alcohol but also par@@ at@@ se@@ di@@ um or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ ph@@ et , and thus lose performance .
so the ri@@ vals will pay even more , and in the future the boys will be even worse .
what is more , the pain will not remain in the bodies anyway for so long .
if you take a pain@@ kil@@ ler in the morning , then you are doing it with an empty th@@ read - it anno@@ ys you about the already ra@@ va@@ ged machine .
or , if the partner is not taken with it , it can get through itself well .
it is something like wal@@ king , but there is no room for compla@@ c@@ ency in wal@@ king .
however , far too active a speed and ex@@ or@@ bit@@ ant pos@@ ture was avoided - the physical effort should be moderate at the time of the bo@@ y .
a jo@@ ke .
there is a sil@@ ver talk , easy fu@@ n and na@@ il @-@ friendly talk with the friends of time and with others ( suffering ) .
a Naz@@ is and a woman may not be hi@@ jac@@ ked , but they certainly make it easier to tolerate after the phenomenon .
once again , the po@@ cket is going through anyway !
worker at the University of North@@ w@@ ester and Ox@@ ford will be sought as suspects of murder
according to the police , an employee at the University of North@@ w@@ ester@@ n and the University of Ox@@ ford is being se@@ ar@@ ched nation@@ wide , who has become suspects following deadly March w@@ ounds to find the bodies of the male people in a luxury bas@@ ket in Ch@@ ic@@ ago .
according to the C@@ oo@@ k Coun@@ ty judicial documents , an arrest warrant was issued on Monday without any bail @-@ out for the arrest of a 42 @-@ year @-@ old W@@ yn@@ d@@ ha@@ m La@@ them@@ i and a 56 @-@ year @-@ old Andrew War@@ ren@@ i , accused of their alleged involvement in first instance , T@@ ren@@ ton H. James Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ u .
according to the documents , a 26 @-@ year @-@ old Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ é@@ u died after repeated marriages .
according to the warning issued to the community by the police station in Ch@@ ic@@ ago , the body was found to be dead on 27 July .
the police received a telephone call call and found a victim on arrival in the Grand Pla@@ za Cor@@ ter@@ house whose body had several stor@@ ms open .
the officials said that Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ u was recognised to be dead and the investi@@ g@@ ators regarded the murder as murder , while the police actively seek two suspects .
Ms La@@ them has worked as co @-@ profes@@ sors of micro@@ bi@@ ology and immun@@ ology at the North@@ w@@ ester University since 2007 .
C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge , Vice @-@ President of the University of Public Relations , said in a statement sent as e @-@ mail that La@@ them has now been temporarily removed from work and banned from entering the cities of the University of North@@ w@@ ester .
&quot; this is now a criminal act under investigation by the competent authorities , and the North@@ w@@ ester University is working with the investi@@ g@@ ators , &quot; said C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge .
W@@ ret@@ n is a senior assis@@ tant at the University of Ox@@ ford .
in a statement sent as an email to the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College , he said , &apos; We have been in contact with the British police and ready to help the US investigation authorities in every possible way &apos; .
in addition , the statement stated that my colleagues at War@@ ren@@ i were shocked and willing to present themselves .
An@@ th@@ ony G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , head of the communication department in Ch@@ ic@@ ago &apos;s police department , is urging the authorities to be handed over by suspects .
&quot; the police have an idea of where they are , but we are working increasingly intensively to define the exact location , &quot; said G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m says that the local , regional and national authorities are helping to search for suspects .
G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m said that the police got a telephone call from the Grand Pla@@ za Cor@@ ter@@ house administra@@ tor , who had just received ch@@ ry@@ p@@ tic rain that something had happened in Cor@@ ps No 10@@ 08 .
according to the police descri@@ ptions , this was a vi@@ vid view .
according to G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , it is not clear whether the event itself took place on 27 July .
he said that the security camer@@ as confirmed the presence of La@@ them@@ i and War@@ ren@@ i in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor La@@ th@@ a@@ mal and the victim had a relationship , &quot; added G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
the Grand Pla@@ za leadership sent out a letter to the population : &apos; the police are currently working to find out about the or@@ ch@@ ron@@ ology of events and the background to the victim , and are exploring different mo@@ tives , including the possibility of a family dispute &apos; .
firms that help your company avoid becoming the next U@@ b@@ by
A@@ my Er@@ re@@ tt wanted to measure workers &apos; satisfaction in his e @-@ commerce start @-@ ups , but the polls were fu@@ tile .
the answers were often vague , useless or , worse , misleading .
and even if he promised to ensure anon@@ y@@ mity , some workers did not trust this process .
&apos;@@ The system was simply not consistent and objective , &apos; said Er@@ re@@ tt , who runs an e @-@ commerce company , Mad@@ ison Re@@ ed , which sel@@ ls ha@@ ir @-@ care products in San Franc@@ is@@ co@@ s with 75 employees .
he therefore called for assistance from outside .
start @-@ ups dealing with new types of human resources are emerging , helping companies to find out what their workers feel .
by developing and licen@@ sing software aimed at measuring the involvement of workers , they will enable companies to make app surveys , target specific teams and demographic groups , provide anon@@ y@@ mity and a hot line of submission of complaints to workers , and in some cases allow them to by@@ pass C @-@ level managers and address the G@@ over@@ ning Board directly .
&quot; there are now tools such as Stra@@ va and F@@ it@@ bi for health monitoring , but where is F@@ it@@ bi for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ net@@ t , co @-@ foun@@ der and CE@@ O Reding City start @-@ ups G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytical tool is used by companies to measure worker involvement .
according to an Er@@ ret@@ ti , in the three years he has used G@@ lin@@ t , he has got a much better picture of what his staff think and feel .
in addition to opinion polls aimed at intr@@ usive studies and certain teams , it provides a company &apos;s heat card , which gives an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest support , enabling them to identify the causes .
companies have started to realise that they need to stay informed about their working culture so as not to become the next U@@ b , which has been revol@@ ted in scandals since the former employee published a blo@@ g mail describing a har@@ as@@ sing environment in which those who da@@ red to speak were punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , the desire to have an overview is a lu@@ cra@@ tive business opportunity .
the global area of governance , regulation and compliance may be worth more than USD 118@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the results of the FTT Statis@@ tics website L@@ et &apos;s talk @-@ about boo@@ k@@ ings .
this year , against the background of the dubious reputation of U@@ ber , a start @-@ up company operating in Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o , which helps businesses to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour , observed an increase in interest and activity .
it has almost 600 customers , including Airbus , Microsoft and T@@ es@@ la .
U@@ ber recently registered himself as a cli@@ ent .
like G@@ lin@@ ki , the convergence cent allows companies to send custo@@ mised boo@@ k@@ ings , collect real @-@ time confidential responses and look at problem areas of heat cards .
it also offers an anon@@ ymous model of message that enables workers to report inappropriate behaviour .
and when it comes to the CE@@ O , complaints go to the Bureau directly .
&apos;@@ Public opinion has been delivered by the regulatory authorities , &apos; said Customs cen@@ ti &apos;s foun@@ der and CE@@ O , Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan .
I will say that if a company finds that it mis@@ treated its workers or beha@@ ves une@@ th@@ ically , it could face serious consequences , such as consumer boycot@@ ts , the withdrawal of workers and court cases , even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene .
Ru@@ by interoperability , a restaur@@ ant with more than 2@@ 5,000 employees at 500 sites , has been using the convergence cen@@ sus for more than a year to ensure that workers are aware of the rules and procedures and provide an easy way to communicate with the corpor@@ ation headquarters .
if an employee wanted to report a problem earlier , he had to find a telephone number or email address at the corpor@@ ation headquarters , make an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously .
this was often a da@@ un@@ ting and un@@ comfortable process , said Ru@@ by Technical General Ad@@ vis@@ er James Vit@@ ran@@ o , who said that there was no good way to monitor workers &apos; complaints .
however , now that the company uses convergence cen@@ ti , problems such as discrimination , harassment or unfair pay practices , which did not previously lead to managers operating in offices located in other cities or states , can be identified and dealt with more quickly .
&quot; I can get closer to the holistic 3@@ 60 degree experience of the workers , &quot; said Vit@@ ran@@ o , who chairs the Ru@@ by telecommunications risk management group .
&quot; and we will protect our shareholders from legal disputes with workers . &quot;
the Qu@@ in@@ lan said that companies started to take ethical behaviour , values and workers &apos; involvement much more seriously in 2002 , after an audit@@ or , Ar@@ th@@ ur Andersson , collapsed due to ethical irregularities in the En@@ r@@ on scandal .
however , only when &apos; social media became mature &apos; did companies realise that they could not prevent their black was@@ hing from being cop@@ ied online in public .
&quot; before using the technology to monitor ethical behaviour , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both the G@@ rea@@ t and the convergence cent offer their software as a service , charging companies perio@@ dic@@ ally for using their products .
it is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors , who have supported both start @-@ ups .
the convergence was funded in February by companies such as S@@ ap@@ ph@@ ire Ven@@ tures and Customs Capital , thereby increasing the capital collected to USD 47 million .
in November , the G@@ lin@@ ti invested USD 10 million in B@@ es@@ se@@ mer Ven@@ ture partners , increasing its total funding to USD 60 million .
such investments will come as no surprise given the inter@@ conne@@ c@@ tedness of businesses , culture and venture capital .
more and more research shows that today &apos;s workers expect more from the workplace than they have done in the past .
in competitive markets , such as S@@ ili@@ c@@ on Val@@ ley , high wages and interesting projects are merely contributions on the table .
the workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they are de@@ voting their time to a company with a positive mission .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen people are happy at the company , they feel they are listened to and more satisfied with the work they are doing , &apos; said N@@ ina Mc@@ Qu@@ e@@ en , Vice @-@ President of the Department for General benefit and Workers &apos; Survey , L@@ in@@ ke@@ d@@ In@@ is , which uses not only convergence cen@@ ti but also G@@ lin@@ ti .
investors earn money if the companies in their portfolio are doing well ; companies are doing well when workers are committed and involved .
if the third party &apos;s analytical tools allow for an increase in the commitment and involvement of workers , it is no wonder that they will receive support .
having data on worker involvement is important , according to professionals .
however , this data will be useless if it is not followed up by company supervisors .
in fact , when a company asks for feedback from its employees , it may raise expectations that change is under way .
and if changes are not made quickly enough or not at all , they can cause disappointment and reduce workers &apos; involvement .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen you ask for 4 000 proposals , you have to be prepared for 4 000 conver@@ sa@@ tions , &apos; said the President of the Con@@ sul@@ tative and Business Administration , K@@ ot@@ ter International , R@@ us@@ sell Ra@@ ath , who has seen companies go wrong by relying too much on data collection .
&apos;@@ I@@ f things are not brought to an end , the workers will think : &apos; did you actually listen to me ?
do you care ?
and if you do not care , why should I care ? &apos;
according to the Er@@ ret@@ ti , the Mad@@ ison Rhine , which now organis@@ es six studies among workers , has been able to take action on the same day that the problem has been reported through G@@ lin@@ t .
and , having received feedback from workers disappointed with the speed and the quality of the decision @-@ making process , he was able to re@@ organise a number of cre@@ ws in the company and offer communication training to deal with the problems .
however , Ru@@ by interoperability will collect new data on workers and it is hoped that , in the long term , this will result in a longer @-@ term commitment from the industry , known for its high turnover .
&apos;@@ I@@ f you are not committed to transparency , you will lose people &apos; said Vit@@ ran@@ o .
&apos;@@ I@@ f you lose people , you lose customers .
and if you lose your customers , you lose companies &apos; .
Baltic Sta@@ r for the euro area : fast @-@ growing incomes
although the 2008 crisis and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic , the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching Western European rich countries &apos; incomes , with reference to the European Central Bank &apos;s report , B@@ om@@ berg wri@@ tes .
the Central Bank says that since 1999 , total economic output per capita in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations .
low indeb@@ tedness , fast @-@ improving institutions and business @-@ friendly and non @-@ market @-@ friendly policies are the key to success .
&quot; the Baltic States , together with Slovakia , are among the few countries in the euro area , where reactor @-@ GDP per capita purchasing power has significantly conver@@ ged towards the EU average . &quot;
although the objective is for the total economic output per capita to be equ@@ alised to a richer Western Europe , in 2015 the total output of the Baltic economies per capita amounted to only 2 / 3 of the national average of the 15 countries that were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round .
low wages have led the Bal@@ tics to seek better wages from abroad .
although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic countries in a positive light and the economy grow@@ s this year , the local people are not enthusiastic at all .
according to the latest Eurobarometer survey , only a quarter of people in Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies were doing very well or rather well .
in the Czech Republic and Poland a little less than half of those surve@@ yed thought this about their national economies .
N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s decision to cancel trends twice a day makes Bru@@ in@@ si long
it is almost 23 o &apos;@@ clock that football lo@@ vers in the ma@@ fi@@ er U@@ C@@ L@@ A are stopped for discussion on the f@@ ring@@ es of a new ou@@ tle@@ t in the university town of a team .
some of them have burdened their businesses with the first day of their training camp &apos;s efforts to un@@ cover their plight .
for a large part of the team , these Christmas minutes offer a break from mid@@ day to mid@@ day .
the players taking part in the course of the course will return , after a three @-@ hour trend , to the learning of co@@ habi@@ tation for final exa@@ min@@ ations before returning for next morning &apos;s 6.@@ 30 meetings at the W@@ SS@@ man football es@@ cor@@ t .
&apos;@@ The next three days will be a real challenge for them , &apos; said the Bru@@ in@@ si train@@ er , Jim Mor@@ a , shortly before Monday became Tuesday .
the N@@ CA@@ A decision to cancel trends twice a day to reduce the burden of players has , in fact , over@@ stret@@ ched their days - at least until we get to one side with final exa@@ min@@ ations on Friday .
for this reason , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ L@@ A were ti@@ med to start at 19.@@ 15 in order to fit into the already den@@ se schedule of the players .
the transition from two to more days on a daily basis means more days on a tr@@ ong : the start of the Bru@@ in@@ si training camp has been increased almost a week ahead compared to the previous season and , for the first time , during the six W@@ es@@ tw@@ ard season , training sessions are taking place during summer courses .
they are planning until 20 August to 18 trends before formal preparations begin for the opening game in September against T@@ ex@@ as A &amp; M .
according to Mor@@ a , he is in favour of a change of the N@@ CA@@ A rules , although it adds another item to the players &apos; tight schedu@@ les .
&apos;@@ Th@@ ese have an enormous burden on three or four days and that is a serious challenge , &apos; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; and they are going through this challenge ; they are struggling , they are wonderful young people .
I believe that when it comes to Saturday and we have more time , it will be a real pleasure . &quot;
once the camp is over , U@@ C@@ L@@ A training will be closed down , which is no easy task , however , given the clear view of their remote par@@ king pos@@ ter and remote from the centre of L@@ us@@ kin@@ i , a high @-@ class hotel that has already emerged from the gate mail protection network with foot@@ bal@@ ls .
since this weekend , ho@@ tels are occupied by players in Bru@@ in@@ si , but Mor@@ a acknowledged that problems could arise during the season with free tobacco .
&apos;@@ S@@ tr@@ eng@@ th@@ ening security measures &apos; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; this is a real cause for concern and it is hardly exagg@@ erated to think that people can rent a mo@@ use and fil@@ ter from there .
if you have a record of a training , you can do quite a good deal .
but we have a security team there and at the 8@@ th par@@ king station .
we will do our best to use what we have .
I will try not to worry very much about this .
we have a plan in place . &quot;
an Ele@@ ction Union of Sa@@ du@@ are @-@ I@@ van@@ o@@ va , born of the Central Party , an Ele@@ ction Union for Re@@ publi@@ can Na@@ ti@@ ina O@@ range , removed from the Reform Party and forced to leave the ECB for Maria Kal@@ j@@ ds , to show at least as much as political parties involved in the local elections this year in Te@@ Tallinn , an electoral association of creative business@@ men , seems to be in party politics .
however , hor@@ ses will be counted in the autumn , and the key question will be whether they will have sufficiently disappointed voters .
who will remain in Sa@@ sta@@ are@@ a ?
how small the support department of Ed@@ gar Sa@@ sta@@ are has sh@@ run@@ k , one might expect events or@@ ch@@ es@@ tra@@ ted to honour his electoral union .
one member of the National Assembly , some former and present @-@ day affi@@ lia@@ tions and many unknown faces : will this be the composition of the electoral Union ?
and why , in Tallinn , some fai@@ th@@ ful sympath@@ is@@ ers and sis@@ ters avoid standing as candidates , can one ask that the &apos; Sa@@ sta@@ are list &apos; of origin@@ ators , led by corruption and suspected of corruption , is becoming a reality ?
for a Russian @-@ speaking po@@ em involving the parent of the city of Las@@ na@@ p , which was boo@@ sted by the municipal@@ ity , and for all purposes a pri@@ mi@@ tive computer game in which Prime Minister J@@ ü@@ ri Ra@@ tas , while travelling on a ru@@ g , must the central party avoid the voices of 16 and 17 @-@ year @-@ old voters who are admitted to the ballot bo@@ xes for the first time ?
we look forward to other parties &apos; perception of the youth campaign .
there are two options to accept that only ET@@ V , ET@@ V@@ 2 , ET@@ V + , Tallinn &apos;s TV and English @-@ language Fran@@ ce@@ 24 channels will henceforth be viewed as opposed to enter@@ tainment from the beginning of August : to accept that , in future , only 10 tele@@ communication operators will see the wh@@ eel@@ 2 , ET@@ V@@ 2 , ET@@ V + , Tallinn &apos;s TV and English @-@ language Fran@@ ce@@ 24 channels or will be sur@@ rendered every month .
there are probably also those who initially openly re@@ jo@@ ice in the non @-@ adver@@ tised television experience , but in the end - albeit reluc@@ tantly - pay for television broadcas@@ ts and advertise@@ ments .
De@@ af@@ ening music , la@@ den nation and rub@@ b@@ ish left on the streets are some un@@ pleasant side of every major mus@@ ical affair .
however , if one does not want to be part of the honey itself , it is worth going home to discover a homeland instead of pain@@ ting its head , and leaving the s@@ lee@@ ping room for the Cop@@ tic sum of the festi@@ vals .
Washington changes rules on Green Card
media publis@@ hers quote President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i , who said that a new US immigration plan will change the rules of the Green Card .
the plan foresees a reduction in the number of legal immigrants for 50 000 people per year , stricter rules on obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visas .
the new rules have been proposed by the Re@@ publi@@ can and supported by the President .
the draft law will be discussed in two cha@@ mbers of Congress .
&quot; this law reduces poverty , increases wages and sa@@ ves billions of dollars of taxpayers &apos; money by changing the way the US hand@@ les green cards to citizens of other countries .
the law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme .
the new application process will give priority to candidates who speak English and have the funds to support themselves and the skills to benefit our economy , &quot; said T@@ ru@@ mp , the US media ou@@ tle@@ ts .
the young people of Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ to move to the city , to pensioners , back to the land .
Ju@@ ev@@ se@@ ye@@ v is continuing the tradition of famous se@@ to gold min@@ ers along the Ma@@ ana River in the past .
she works 140 kilometres away from her home in Ma@@ ana &apos;s additional war at Ku@@ vai in a gold @-@ on @-@ board car driver .
it is a tough job : two months of work for 12 hours without rest days , and then only 10 days at home and again at home .
in the three @-@ year period in which the Ar@@ tel worked , A@@ na@@ tol@@ y has only once seen its gold .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at is a th@@ or@@ ny regime there : when you go in , you are thoroughly checked to ensure that you do not lead , and when you make it clear that it does not lead to gold , A@@ na@@ tol@@ y speaks . &apos;
M@@ are Pi@@ ho is speaking to H@@ ai@@ da in the village of H@@ ai@@ da , a local se@@ to Ja@@ an , who has spoken to him a great deal about the memor@@ ies of his family in Si@@ beria .
the remaining archa@@ ic culture of Si@@ b@@ erian comp@@ ounds will also have an impact on the home @-@ me@@ ters , as it is simply so dramatic that it will think most deeply about the distant c@@ oo@@ ks investigated by Pi@@ ho M@@ are .
his first trip to Si@@ beria will be 30 years later this year .
during that time , he has been there four@@ teen times and lived there for one year .
how much went to Si@@ beria at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century to get land here ?
this is an unresolved issue .
I would argue that 8 000 .
I took this out of the story of the men in Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ to , who have thought about it themselves .
it is very difficult to say , because up to 30 people could come to one group at the time , but only a man was given a passport .
the passport was given to only one , but it was children , sis@@ ters and other female .
look at how large that territory was here !
it was several times greater than historical S@@ et@@ ko .
after all , it needed to be nur@@ tured , managed in some way .
S@@ et@@ ry came here as pe@@ as@@ ants , but their lives changed , because here they got into areas not only linked to agriculture , but also to the river ( pal@@ e @-@ par@@ king ) , gold mines , industry .
for example , in New Pet@@ ser@@ is , many se@@ als later went to work in a classified city of K@@ ras@@ no@@ se@@ sk @-@ 45 ( where the Soviet authorities built a uranium @-@ enrichment plant - J. P@@ . ) when it was formed .
did the mix@@ tures then represent the majority of the population in this region ?
yes , they used to live in a Compact .
in addition , the tradition of mar@@ ried with one another and of multic@@ ul@@ tur@@ alism maintained for a long time .
seven to eight children in the family were common@@ place .
how different does Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ room culture differ from that of the mother country ?
they are different , even though what was brought here was once the same .
they brought a great many ideas of peace .
they also made their own distinc@@ tions ( ideas of the people ) at the time , but they always made a distinction between what had happened and what had been done here .
climate change has seriously influenced the traditional clo@@ thes of se@@ als , because it is col@@ der here .
the proposed changes were made .
for example , S@@ et@@ oma@@ al had a salt pla@@ te , but it was simply frozen here .
where are the Si@@ b@@ erian comp@@ ound villages and what life will live there ? / graph@@ ics : A@@ lar@@ i Pal@@ u@@ ends ?
the link with the mother country was spiri@@ tually strong , it was considered very important .
it seems to me that this country will now be giving back there ; it will influence them .
those girls who have lived in families have listened to ama@@ zing stories .
Pi@@ ho has in mind people from the Estonian se@@ room delegation who came to H@@ ai@@ da Bay Day at the beginning of July and lived in homes for four days - J. P .
what is still here is sta@@ ggering .
&apos;@@ It is extremely easy to come and get off the ro@@ of , because the city has a wonderful location : a railway be@@ er and a road crossing point &apos; , says T@@ ap@@ s &apos;s oper@@ is@@ ol@@ ist from Re@@ ig@@ o Tampere .
the city is no longer just a military capital ; we have a great deal of nature , sport and culture , and the car@@ rot gets everywhere .
T@@ ap@@ a is a ti@@ p @-@ po@@ p city !
there are a small island in which you are going through the white river through the city to keep the th@@ era@@ pe@@ u@@ tic shel@@ ls .
&apos;@@ This beautiful place on the train screen does not appear , &apos; Re@@ ig@@ o is mu@@ d@@ dled .
W@@ ho@@ ever is not afraid of cold water can sw@@ im@@ ming the river because the river is full of sources .
I have been to sw@@ im@@ ming there , you can do it !
the river &apos;s water can be held long and simply ro@@ man@@ tics : one can look at the flow of the river and think about life and think about it .
I , too , have been there with my bri@@ de .
apart from anything else , Tampere , on a river stret@@ ch between the three bridges , has even got used to the scen@@ es : &apos; since this place is next to the city , no one may even have to come up as their stories tell me &apos; .
&quot; a wonderful view of T@@ ap@@ a is emerging from the toy hill , but there are also health professionals where you can drink , ski@@ e the winter and now , for example , dis@@ c@@ gol@@ f playing - the gol@@ f course has been taken , the chains can lend from the sports centre , &quot; Re@@ ig@@ o pre@@ sides .
the old pro@@ tag@@ onists , of course , go there with their spring , but I have not yet played there .
obviously my colleague , Ras@@ mus Gol@@ l , must be invited to visit T@@ ap@@ ale , because he has experienced a dis@@ cer@@ n@@ ment of dis@@ cer@@ n@@ ment , and he has a super@@ market .
perhaps he will lend me !
Re@@ ig@@ o and M@@ än@@ ni@@ ku@@ p were in@@ ex@@ tri@@ c@@ ably in@@ separ@@ able from the times of their childhood .
at least during the ski@@ ing hours .
there are many te@@ ars , many dis@@ appointments to this memory and you can be seen in my sporting life .
not to mention bur@@ nt @-@ down clo@@ cks and ski moun@@ tains .
&quot; the city as a whole is now full of construction works , all this becomes unknown , &quot; Re@@ ig@@ o pra@@ ises .
however , an old and ti@@ red shel@@ f building is a very attractive place where oral disco@@ veries are played .
I am pleased that , in 2012 , the leader of R@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ M adopted my idea in Me@@ os and had to make a permanent summer theat@@ re with his theat@@ re .
although this year &apos;s theat@@ re season &apos; Alex@@ ey@@ i K@@ aren@@ in &apos; has just come to an end , on 11 August , the railway station &apos; El@@ lu@@ ding &apos; is on its way around the 1980s .
&quot; between 11 and 13 August , T@@ ap@@ a will be the city of T@@ ap@@ a &apos;s Day , which has w@@ ok@@ en in an open house office building and which will host a series of cultural events , including a crow@@ d of people , &quot; says Re@@ ig@@ o , who is just calling for a visit to the city from 9 to 11 years .
in a poor three @-@ chamber ba@@ g on 1 May , a muse@@ um has already been in place since 1994 .
&apos;@@ Bu@@ il@@ ding is a small house , but there is a great deal of information and a huge amount of information &apos; , it bo@@ asts Re@@ ig@@ o of a place full of the history of the city of T@@ ap@@ a , most of which focuses on the railways and on war@@ fare .
Re@@ ig@@ o mu@@ d@@ gates that , if T@@ ap@@ al goes through all the recommended sites , the st@@ oma@@ ch will be empty , but fortunately the small city will be full of ca@@ f@@ és .
&apos;@@ We have such good di@@ ets and sometimes get the feeling that you are abroad when you are sitting in ca@@ f@@ és &apos; , he describes .

in Greece , two Bulg@@ arians were arrested for making illegal ten@@ ts
television channel b@@ TV quoted a foreign Ministry who reported that two Bulg@@ arians were arrested in Greece for having ordered illegally .
on the morning of 1 August , a group of illegally ordered persons were arrested by the police on the island of Si@@ th@@ onia , including two Bulg@@ arians .
they were released on the same day , but an investigation is under way .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the television channel that Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free ten@@ dering and are already imposing heavy penalties on all those who are caught in a holiday place that is not intended to do so .
checks will continue throughout the season .
according to the Ministry , the court may impose a fine .
the ar@@ mi@@ es that teach the bul@@ lets are breaking the sheep .
the farmers on the shel@@ f have to give their w@@ ol@@ f &apos; educational material &apos; again after a year - the w@@ ol@@ ves that have obviously taught spa@@ w@@ ns have already bur@@ ned a lot of sheep .
this year w@@ ol@@ ves in the coun@@ ty of Hi@@ i@@ u have broken sheep three times , a total of 23 sheep and eight have been injured , writing the Hi@@ i@@ u site .
it was only three , or 124 years earlier .
in syn@@ dro@@ me , the Environment Agency has also found out that w@@ ol@@ f was@@ hing machines were not born on last year &apos;s Hi@@ pe land and that the spra@@ w@@ l Council of Hi@@ ves said that two w@@ ol@@ ves were fixed on the island this year .
against mid@@ night on Monday , the w@@ ol@@ ves unle@@ as@@ hed 15 sheep in the village of K@@ abu@@ ana and w@@ ounded 18 of the survi@@ v@@ ors .
in the early morning of Wednesday &apos;s morning , the w@@ ol@@ f broke one lam@@ b on the Coun@@ ty of the Re@@ he@@ il village and severely injured another , who had to be subjected to an emergency killing .
the rules on the management of genetically modified crops must be clear
the Ministry of Rural Affairs has sent a round of coordination to the law on the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment ( GMOs V@@ S ) and a draft law amending plant protection law .
the amendment of the law remo@@ ves the creation of a separate collection of data both for GM ( GM ) crops and operators , using a future register of plant health .
in addition , the GM crop operator is changing the obligation to have a prior agreement on the radio to ap@@ ic@@ ulture .
although no GM crops are being culti@@ vated in Estonia at present , we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of GM and non @-@ GM crops .
at least as long as it has not been decided to declare a GMO @-@ free in Estonia , S@@ ig@@ mar Suu Kyi , head of the plant health department at the Department of Rural Affairs , said .
&quot; at the same time , we need to take into account that the measures we have developed need to be targeted and proportionate , taking into account the costs and administrative burden for both the private and public sectors . &quot;
the draft act repe@@ als the provisions relating to the collection and training of GM crop locations and hand@@ lers in V@@ S , lays down requirements for the management of the GM crop and the opening up of economic activities .
as regards beekeeping , the GM crop farmer &apos;s current obligation to inform bee@@ keepers about the cultivation of a GM crop with the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with bee@@ keepers before starting cultivation .
the draft law has been sent for coordination between minis@@ tries .
all interested parties will have the opportunity to famili@@ arise themselves with this in the information system and , if they so wish , present their views to the World Department .
the proposed changes will affect , in particular , those in the plant farming sector , bee@@ keepers and the Agriculture Agency .
only one GM crop - mon 8@@ 10 - can be culti@@ vated in the European Union , including Estonia .
as yet , no Estonian farmer has taken an interest in culti@@ vating a GM crop .
the reason for this is that Estonia does not have a swe@@ et ch@@ arity , a European cor@@ n for which the maize line mon 8@@ 10 is resistant .
the articles on this land@@ line have also been slaugh@@ tered for the southern regions , and this May will not be appropriate for our climate conditions .
in 2015 and 2016 , the Department of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies to detect possible contamination of GM organisms in the seeds of various types of f@@ at@@ tening , maize and soya grown in Estonia .
the analysis of the sam@@ ples carried out showed that seeds were not present and that the study concluded that the seeds of increased rape , maize and soya in Estonia did not contain genetically modified organisms .
the previous one , in turn , suggests that there is no deliberate cultivation of GM crops in Estonia , nor was it confirmed that there was no random contamination .

E@@ pon@@ der of the White House cost taxpayers thousands
according to military documents dis@@ closed to the magaz@@ ine , the White House &apos;s decision to fly the na@@ vy helicop@@ ter last month for an attempt to celebrate American production has cost the southern taxpayer as much as USD 24 000 .
the green and white colour , S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D , ter@@ med Marine One under the President &apos;s presidency &apos;s presidency , was the cen@@ tre@@ piece of an event presenting the American construction programmes in the White House on 17 July .
President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp , senior officials of Vice @-@ President M@@ ike P@@ ence and the White House announced industrial products in all 50 states during their t@@ our .
the helicop@@ ter set up in Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ u@@ tis was ex@@ hi@@ b@@ iting with a hun@@ t from repu@@ te , a W@@ is@@ con@@ ist fire @-@ fighting car and a two @-@ stro@@ ke ta@@ ble@@ t manufactured in Mis@@ sis@@ ter .
the H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter &apos;s Marine H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter S@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ on One ( H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 ) document , in charge of operating the H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter , showed that the White House &apos;s military c@@ abinet &apos;s presence was cla@@ m@@ ouring for a helicop@@ ter presence , known as the F@@ AR@@ G@@ O @-@ ga , in a narrow picture of 36 hours before the helicop@@ ter bu@@ ried for an extraordinary event in the southern hor@@ ror .
&apos;@@ I wanted you to be aware of this , because it is an un@@ usually high @-@ profile event , &apos; said H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 com@@ man@@ der a day before the event , in an e @-@ mail , a de@@ ser@@ t of his sup@@ eri@@ ority , a naval officer .
the message stated that the helicop@@ ter would arrive in the southern hor@@ ror at around 7 p.m. on the morning of 17 July and remain there until the Christmas night between 18 and 21 is cleared .
what was added was the fact that , should there be a departure from the White House , a return flight will require a second b@@ rick flight due to the restrictions on working time .
the original flight team was at the helicop@@ ter during the event , and the security team sta@@ yed near the aircraft for all the time it was on the ground .
it was not possible to find out from the documents that were submitted to the magaz@@ ine whether , in the end , a second b@@ rick boat was needed or not .
the H@@ at@@ ch Act prohibits federal workers from using government property for political purposes .
the documents show that H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 examined whether this action could breach this provision .
&apos;@@ We won@@ dered whether it was a violation of H@@ at@@ ch &apos;s law and we were told that it would not violate , &apos; wrote com@@ man@@ der .
&apos;@@ It seems that you have no choice , &apos; responded to the Deputy senior officer .
the White House declared the &apos; American @-@ made &apos; event an official event , and the H@@ at@@ ch law would not have covered it .
but even the official events have political under@@ ton@@ es .
at the event , the President supported the efforts of the Health Reform in the Senate at the time and praised efforts to keep government regulations in check .
using an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Task Force for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon .
they must be used by the Presidents to travel .
however , the requirement to use them purely as a photo@@ graph is unusual .
in February , a T@@ ru@@ mp drew attention to his first campaign event , F@@ ool Mel@@ bour@@ ne , a president &apos;s plane on a water background , and he dis@@ plays Twitter &apos;s account of the messages complaining about how his predecessor used the plane .
the White House is very pleased with the display &apos; made in America &apos; of products from all 50 states produced by American workers from American materials , &apos; said L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters , spokes@@ man of the White House .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often perform test flights around Washington and on a southern hor@@ ror in order to get used to wa@@ tering down a cent @-@ me@@ tre with the US President &apos;s White House .
when the T@@ ru@@ mp was at the beginning of July at the G20 in Germany , the H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 White House was carrying out 58 tests .
according to the official , the &apos; American @-@ made &apos; flight flight crew was included as the standard for the monthly study flights .
Monday &apos;s helicop@@ ters flo@@ ated 11 more hours on that day for &apos; non @-@ presidential support missions &apos; .
according to the White House , none of the other ex@@ hi@@ b@@ itors of this event burden the taxpayers &apos; purse .
Mr S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky &apos;s representative said that the company was not involved in carrying out ex@@ propri@@ ation at the southern hor@@ ror of the helicop@@ ter .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 will not maintain the budgetary documents for the President &apos;s flights and the precise costs of the event will be difficult to identify .
however , the Department of Defence &apos;s prices for the financial year 2017 indicate that the V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D reimbursement rate is USD 24 380 per hour per flight .
the Es@@ ka@@ da@@ r documents indicated a flight stret@@ ch by 30 minutes from Qu@@ an@@ tic@@ o Air@@ port to Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , its main base .
the White House claims that the real cost of using the helicop@@ ter is well below that amount .
&quot; calculating taxpayers &apos; costs on the basis of estimated compensation rates is very misleading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at &apos;s estimated compensation rates include many other irreversible costs for staff , maintenance and expenditure which will be taken into account in the annual appropriations &apos; .
according to the rand survey of 2015 , the Department of Defence &apos;s reimbursement rates do not include personnel costs , but they cover fuel , maintenance and contract costs .
the former spokes@@ person of the White House , Se@@ an S@@ pic@@ er , defended the use of the helicop@@ ter at the time at the event .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at is about showing things made in America this week , &apos; said S@@ pic@@ er .
&quot; and I know that the State of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ u@@ t is very proud to contribute to our national security and that there are expected to be hundreds , if not thousands , of people whose work depends on it .
and I believe that just like most Americans , we are all proud of this helicop@@ ter and other military equipment , which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rele@@ ssly on .
so of course it is right to highlight this . &quot;
whether or not the T@@ ru@@ mp had to deal with the helicop@@ ter during the southern hor@@ ror event was or not , he was lying behind the whe@@ el in the fire @-@ fighting car .
in the White House , T@@ ru@@ mp S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky &apos;s representatives ap@@ pealed to them , throwing out a mo@@ ck@@ ery of a company &apos;s products in his individual aircraft fleet .
&apos;@@ I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ ská very well , &apos; said the President , &apos; I have three of their products &apos; .

once &apos; , Sh@@ ade@@ ik@@ o spra@@ yed .
worse still to come : a month later , his Olympic competition in Ri@@ os broke the first hur@@ dle as a result of a re@@ ig@@ ni@@ tion .
the time had to be taken down - whether to continue with the seven competitions at all ?
is it all worth the effort of two days ?
N@@ ei@@ u thought for a long time , but found peace .
I was able to think clean on my head .
it is quite difficult to describe this experience , but I have won@@ dered that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen .
T@@ han@@ k@@ fully , there was time to cure ourselves health@@ ily and think twice .
&quot; I knew I would not put a ba@@ g on my des@@ k yet , &quot; said Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o of his self @-@ cle@@ ans@@ ing .
I was able to turn the page and move forward with a new momentum .
T@@ re@@ en@@ er Anne mä@@ ki said that it was very difficult to look at the suffering of the care@@ less , but she realised that the ath@@ le@@ tes themselves , above all , had to make themselves clear .
he was , after all , wh@@ is@@ tle@@ blow@@ ed down by everyone .
it was difficult to tolerate .
&apos;@@ The G@@ ál said , however , that he will not give up and he wants to prove himself what he is worth &apos; says a mountain .
there is now some sort of peace in it .
he is doing so to his deli@@ ght .
the contest came back in May , when Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o set 6@@ 280 points in a new Estonian record in a series of competitions between G@@ idel z@@ is .
in a high @-@ level contest , she improved her personal high @-@ level bul@@ l mes@@ h with almost a me@@ tre ( 13.@@ 89 ) and ran at a record near @-@ time barrier .
there was then a multi @-@ competi@@ tor who felt that this was not at all possible , but that only the initial star@@ vation was ext@@ ingu@@ ished .
a mountain who guided him for years says that Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o is a black pu@@ pi@@ l .
she is an ath@@ le@@ tic ; she is a good teacher .
if something is wrong or wrong , he says it now .
he knows his own body and entr@@ us@@ ts his own sense .
that is the starting point .
I cannot say exactly what to do and follow it up .
Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o has also found a new approach .
&apos;@@ I am not the one who makes the maximum of the trend &apos; , he talks and says that the most important thing is to get the feeling right , because it also ensures a good result .
baby baby bo@@ om@@ ers are happy
the good emo@@ tion has also been offered the good luck of the people who are close .
both his former training fellow Member , Mar@@ is mountain , and sis@@ ter de Gre@@ te , have recently become parents and have received support from new weather citizens .
&apos;@@ It has been quite interesting &apos; , says Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o .
one alcohol whose drinking is tanta@@ mount to the brain &apos; training &apos; .
Li@@ ves@@ tr@@ ong wri@@ tes that Dr Gordon She@@ per@@ d is even such a big wine f@@ ans that he believes that wine can train better than any other part of the world .
She@@ per@@ d is a neuro@@ scien@@ tist at Y@@ ale University .
he says that this is not about alcohol or about how it affects our feelings and our ideas , but about the &apos; very active &apos; process of ta@@ pping wine .
by wh@@ is@@ tle@@ blow@@ ing a glass , by sti@@ r@@ ring it up , enjoying it and dis@@ cer@@ ning a after@@ taste , we are putting our bra@@ ins on the job of creating a taste for wine .
She@@ per@@ di said that the bo@@ vine pu@@ p@@ pi@@ es do not actually contain a taste , but that the taste is generated by the way in which the wine stimu@@ lates the brain .
he makes a comparison between how the brain sees the colour .
&quot; taste is not wine , taste creates a taste for wine , &quot; says She@@ per@@ d .
the things that still affect the taste of a wine are , for example , our age , our gender and even the amount of heart that a man produces .
She@@ per@@ d , of course , ad@@ m@@ ire that wine is not so full of ha@@ ir .
&apos;@@ M@@ ore must be done &apos; , he says .
if you get too fat , the system is over @-@ sa@@ tu@@ rated .
excessive drinking of wine can do harm instead of bra@@ ins - according to a 2004 study , people who drink more than three glass with wine , memory loss , loss of balance and reduced mental capacity risk .
10 % of ICT sector workers in Estonia pay less than colleagues
data from the personnel @-@ search company Fon@@ tes reveals that 10 % of workers in the Estonian ICT sector are paid less than colleagues .
the 10 % pay gap is between men and women , the Ge@@ eni@@ us portal wri@@ tes .
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the Fund &apos;s ICT sector wage study .
a total of 8 5@@ 77 posts were examined .
63 % of the posts were male .
&quot; while only 3 companies concluded that the pay gap is for men and that there is no pay gap for the rest of companies , in reality , compared to the reality , the monthly basic salary for men is on average 10 % higher than that for women and an average 8 % higher than for men &apos;s , &quot; said Fon@@ tes analysis Il@@ mar North .
Nar@@ co@@ se 3 season advertising cli@@ p : now that P@@ ab@@ lo Es@@ co@@ bar has gone , the C@@ ali car@@ tel takes centre stage in the Net@@ f@@ li@@ x H@@ it@@ ts@@ doctor
even though the kil@@ ler of P@@ ab@@ lo Es@@ co@@ bar was revealed in the second season of &apos; Nar@@ co@@ s &apos; , the Net@@ f@@ li@@ x s@@ ari is far from over .
the third and fourth seas@@ ons have been confirmed by the streaming service , the first being a advertising cli@@ p designed to cra@@ ck down on the hor@@ ns with the new wrec@@ ks .
in the third season , the D@@ EA will turn its attention to the world &apos;s rich@@ est drug business organisation , the C@@ ali car@@ tel .
they are acting under the chair@@ manship of four powerful cros@@ ses &apos; like For@@ tune 500 companies &apos; , simply with more bri@@ ber@@ y to the government and more violent acts .
Gil@@ ber@@ to Ro@@ dri@@ guez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Da@@ mi@@ an Al@@ ca@@ z@@ ar ) is the head of the car@@ tel , with Miguel Ro@@ dri@@ guez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Franc@@ is@@ co Den@@ is ) its a@@ the@@ v , Pac@@ ho Her@@ re@@ ra ( Alber@@ to Am@@ mann ) leading links with Mexico and Che@@ pe San@@ ta@@ mentari@@ z London ( Pe@@ pe Ra@@ pa@@ zo@@ te ) operating in New York .

according to the UN , Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
the head of the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that the elections can only represent the people if all members of society , including women , play a role in them .
Nic@@ ho@@ las Ha@@ y@@ so@@ m , the leader of the United Nations Assistance Mission , said that hundreds of women would stand for election in local Soviet elections , three women would stand as Vice @-@ President and more than 30 % of the newly registered voters would be women .
&quot; it is not possible to over@@ state the role of women by underlining it , &quot; he said in a statement made on Wednesday .
the elections can truly represent the people and can only be credible if women are fully involved and involved in all stages of the electoral process .
elections and presidential elections in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April .
the Taliban , for their part , have threatened the electoral process , which coinci@@ des with a transition period in which the role of international military operations will become consultative .
this year &apos;s elections mark the first time that power has been transferred cal@@ mly from one democratically elected government to the next .
Mal@@ ys@@ om says that a strong role for women increases democracy success in Afghanistan .
according to the Afghanistan In@@ dependent electoral Commission , 1.2 million of the 3.@@ 6 million voters have registered with women .
the deli@@ ght of division makes both large and small every thing more acute .
there is always too little time in common , but the trend is a good opportunity to combine meeting , play , clo@@ sen@@ ess and burden .
and what a convenient solution - wherever you are in the summer , living ac@@ cess@@ or@@ ies are always with you and im@@ pati@@ ently remember with your little vo@@ ter : &apos; let us make a move now ! &apos;
with warm insu@@ lation , it is very good to have a normal game of gold or to sli@@ p through a coast@@ line .

it is wonderful to have children instead of can@@ na@@ bis !
firstly , it is safe and comfortable , and the difficulty is gradually increasing at the same pace as the staff of the train@@ er .
advanced energy can also be hun@@ ted with quite a large number of children .
the child is training the balance , reading the cor@@ ps and feeling la@@ x on the possibility of be@@ ating high and important .
larger children can , at the same time , hun@@ t for themselves .
the extent of the movement is in place with regard to land @-@ gra@@ b@@ bing and t@@ ying .
keep your fin@@ gers straight , the pal@@ e in the mini @-@ j@@ ung@@ le properly .
the child can read the fla@@ ts and feel like a train@@ er .

but it is easy to rela@@ x !
game @-@ plan@@ k : take a long plan@@ gu@@ ol@@ n from which to te@@ ar rou@@ gh@@ sho@@ d .
in fact , it is more difficult than usual , but much more a@@ mus@@ ing , to do than in the meantime , to hand over to a friend .
a plant , a te@@ ar market , can be maintained to add the burden and can also be wal@@ ked around in this location .
a little bit more can be put on the w@@ inter@@ s of a smaller child , but the ha@@ bit offers fu@@ n for all children .
while cra@@ bs in the sand stra@@ w@@ ber@@ ries become a ro@@ pe , ash and air meat burden as conta@@ cted .
the child keeps on his feet in such a way that his or her body is even@@ ly distributed in advance and behind .
a hand can be kept in check for tourism .
S@@ li@@ ver leg@@ s and sta@@ ll straight up .
the sun can fly , rela@@ x , strike a balance and be difficult .
the life of a small engine@@ er is an ex@@ hor@@ tation when he gets small things every time he arri@@ ves .
the additional burden will be to pre @-@ emp@@ t the bic@@ y@@ cle .

the children themselves have a great deal of a@@ mus@@ ement to make in a couple and with a pla@@ te .

this followed a child &apos;s safety , an ag@@ on@@ ising position , and kept a back in a neutral position .

travelling from the Philippines to the heart of mo@@ efficient sc@@ ans in the wider world - A@@ pp@@ l@@ g@@ ko@@ t
T@@ ime@@ line bags are a summer class which , in recent years , has become a fa@@ it accomp@@ li in one of the right ski@@ pp@@ ers , which has to be han@@ ged at the end of their hand and which has been used by merchan@@ ts , regardless of their modest origin , to display an additional price label for h@@ iti@@ c .
the si@@ ck@@ ening ba@@ g is probably one such thing that has existed once in life and which has not been aro@@ used by much emo@@ tion .
it simply does exist and , if it does not exist , there is no overla@@ p .
now , on the other hand , be@@ er bags are making a real race , and the sc@@ ans have swit@@ ched their sophisticated de@@ sig@@ ner bags from simple be@@ er bags for summer months .
that being the case , not only is it not a coast@@ dog , but today it is also just as popular as a street chamber , and more courageous women are even wal@@ king into the office .
at this point , however , it is worth making it clear , before doing so , whether such an summer roaming is or whether it is worth having a w@@ et and a lap@@ top computer pushed a little into the official summer .
however , this diversity has made a genuine summer love of women from bre@@ w@@ ers .
the first thing to do , for example , when reading foreign mo@@ il@@ logis@@ ts , is to note that , on holiday , the mo@@ e@@ o@@ gh@@ ur@@ ts are the first thing to do in the local market and acquire some be@@ er bags , which are then the pro@@ ver@@ ge of a full holiday and which go along with be@@ ach , the market and also , as a friend , with a woman on the city &apos;s do@@ or@@ step .
some blo@@ gg@@ ers are even so generous that they buy a larger w@@ ol@@ f on the market and sell or give them away to their loyal read@@ ers .
it is also worth noting that there is so much demand among read@@ ers that women ( and men ! ) in the real world , apparently , go on to each other to become a lu@@ cky owner for some homes .
to some extent , this mad@@ ness is also understandable , as rare times are when , in fashi@@ on@@ able fashion , it is possible to buy things for a few decades .
it is true that ro@@ sy traders have also discovered easy money to make here , and so more sophisticated luxury br@@ ands also sell co@@ ck@@ ta@@ ils for a few hundred euros and a few thousand euros .
obviously , in order to prevent richer customers from having to feel like simple mortality , who try around with some cheap do@@ gs .
for example , D@@ ol@@ ce &amp; Gab@@ ban@@ a can buy a be@@ ating ba@@ g of over a thousand euros .
however , for the interpretation of the Chan@@ el bre@@ w@@ ery , EUR 6 000 can be proposed in the circu@@ it .
however , unlike most of the mo@@ del@@ led buildings , the be@@ er do@@ es@@ n &apos;t inher@@ it at all from some of the great Cape Verde , but their story started far beyond .
indeed , be@@ er bags are said to originate far from the Philippines , where they have been wor@@ n off .
F@@ low@@ ing co@@ ws is primarily an export business there , and very often no business can be seen across the local community .
Re@@ porte@@ dly , the flou@@ ris@@ hing technique dates back to the 14@@ th century and is rather ri@@ fe with the usual bas@@ ket .
however , because the be@@ er does not have to be red as much as the cor@@ k , it will become in@@ habi@@ ted mus@@ cles and other materials that make the co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il more person@@ alised and , by extension , more progressive .
recently , for example , tr@@ end@@ y bags in particular , where pa@@ int stri@@ ps or s@@ kin@@ s have been c@@ oo@@ ked in .
however , an ac@@ tress &apos;s J@@ ane Bir@@ kin@@ i can be sent first and foremost by translation bags , of which the largest red br@@ us@@ h of be@@ er f@@ ans had not been seen before .
indeed , he even f@@ itted the bre@@ wing ba@@ g to all sorts of clothing complex@@ es and did not need to go so much to the Cannes Film F@@ esti@@ val .
however , what does not play a smaller role today in the popul@@ arity of applicants , however , is that looking after them is a da@@ wn and , unlike all the other summer products , they do not have to be ca@@ red for by these special funds , but water and mar@@ ty@@ r di@@ r@@ ty are also doing it .
as always in the case of tr@@ end@@ y rob@@ ber@@ y initiatives , other than the classi@@ cal appearance , br@@ ands have come up with all sorts of interpretations .
for example , if you wish , you can acquire a bun@@ dled clo@@ ak from be@@ er be@@ er or a tiny t@@ reas@@ ure ba@@ g .
at the same time , it is worth remembering that a classi@@ cal be@@ er will never go from fashion to be@@ er flu .
but what is the classi@@ cal bre@@ wing , then ?
for centuries , this kind of stra@@ w of be@@ er , re@@ minis@@ cent of its style , has been considered classi@@ cal and has been opened on the spot and has been short , as well as on be@@ er .

G@@ M@@ B is concerned about investments at the Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e plant in G@@ las@@ go@@ w
the trade union is expected from the leaders of a mature producer , Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e , about long @-@ term production plans at the company &apos;s G@@ las@@ go@@ w plant .
according to G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ land , the company has remained silent on the future of the investment site .
more than 500 people are employed when H@@ ob@@ no@@ b@@ si and the rich know the c@@ oo@@ kies and other products are produced .
the owner of the Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e company , Mr Pla@@ dis , said that he had invested more than GBP 5 million in the site over the last few years .
workers and trade union chair@@ men were employed there &apos; are the first to hear &apos; as something changes in the operation of the plant &apos; .
in a letter to the CE@@ O of the company , G@@ M@@ B Scottish company Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e ap@@ pealed &apos; for concerns that funding would not be used to modernise production lines &apos; .
the G@@ M@@ B senior organis@@ er D@@ re@@ w Du@@ ff@@ y said , &apos; The fact that we do not get clarity from the head of the object on the business needs of Customs and the future investment plan is a cause for deep concern among our Members .
many generations of families have been employed here , and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and people around the G@@ las@@ go@@ w region , an essential pillar for ensuring proper employment in a region with high unemployment and social exclusion .
thus the East of G@@ las@@ go@@ w needs a thri@@ ving manufacturing company in Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e in terms of jobs , wages and well @-@ being , and Bre@@ x , in view of the rise in living costs and the chronic fall in production . &quot;
the planned representative said : &apos; the head of the customs broadcasting site received a letter from G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ ter only yesterday , and the company will reply to him directly because we value active contact with workers and trade union representatives .
two months ago , a regular meeting was held between workers and representatives of the G@@ M@@ B in Customs and openly discussed a number of issues .
we then discussed with the workers that , like all other companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate , we are reviewing what we are doing in an ongoing way - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - in order to ensure that we are competitive .
he added : &apos; in recent years , we have invested more than GBP 5 million in the customs transfer site , most of it having gone into production lines and improving operations .
we fully understand customs interoperability as an object of production and , should there be any change in its activities , workers and trade uni@@ onists will be the first to hear about it . &quot;
did the PS@@ G warn Barcelona three years ago about taking an approach to Ney@@ mari@@ i ?
with la la it may regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tt
the Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not give up efforts to attract Ney@@ mar to his ranks by making an offer of GBP 18@@ 9 million to buy him out , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of this record seiz@@ ure trip ?
this th@@ or@@ ny approach has opened the summer &apos;s transition window , and the L@@ ig@@ ue 1 club is ready to sha@@ ke up more than twice the current world record of over@@ purchasing set by Paul Po@@ g@@ ba &apos;s return to Manch@@ ester Uni@@ tes for GBP 89 million last season .
once the transition has been completed , Ney@@ ra will become the most expensive player in the world as well as the most highly paid professional ath@@ le@@ te in the world who , after taxes , will be paid over GBP 500 000 a week .
Barcelona is also , of course , ang@@ ry because of both the approach and the break @-@ up of Ney@@ mar@@ i , although the source close to Ca@@ tal@@ ans@@ i &apos;s governing board confirms that the club has always looked after the best since its arrival in San@@ to 2013 .
but did the PS@@ G President warn the world of the football world of such an opportunity three years ago ?
when Manch@@ ester City showed an interest in the conclusion of the Bla@@ ise Ma@@ tu@@ ed Agreement in 2014 , N@@ asse@@ r Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f strongly warned all the clubs thinking about recru@@ iting some of the best PS@@ G players .
&apos;@@ I am not concerned because they know that , when they concern some of our players , we stand up to them and make contact with their players , &apos; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but when they try to enter into an agreement with some of our players , they will have to face the consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have gone beyond this limit , as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed an interest in Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti , the PS@@ G central player .
the PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could suffer a set@@ back as a result of this interest by removing one of its precious assets in the form of Ney@@ mar@@ i .
Prime Minister : Ireland wants to build bridges , not borders , after Bre@@ x@@ iti@@ t .
&quot; Bre@@ x is seriously threatened with a w@@ edge between Northern Ireland and Ireland , Great Britain and Ireland , &quot; warned Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r on his first visit to Northern Ireland after he took office in June .
&quot; I cannot imagine who would benefit from it , &quot; he added .
cross @-@ border infrastructure projects made the current free movement of people and goods possible , said Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r .
&quot; this is our vision for the future : building bridges , not borders , &quot; he stressed .
he said earlier that he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union , and because that cannot happen , he will remain part of the European single market .
this would maintain the current free trade between the Irish Republic and the United Kingdom .
another way to make Britain &apos;s departure smoo@@ ther would be to set up a European Union @-@ United Kingdom Customs Union , explaining to the Irish Prime Minister .
noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey , Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r said , &apos; We could certainly have this with Britain &apos; .
the alternative to this would be a return to customs points that would declare historical divisions and political failure .
&apos;@@ L@@ et &apos;s bring about trade , prosperity and peace &apos; said the Irish Prime Minister .
she mentioned Bre@@ x &apos;s &apos; challenge for our generation &apos; and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland &apos;s daily lives .
Irish Prime Minister Bel@@ fast met with leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland .
