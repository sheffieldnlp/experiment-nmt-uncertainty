Four Cape Verde group members were detained in Estonia and Spain
In Spain , the so @-@ called Cape Verde group leader of the Estonian Union , Sluro Gulevich , who is known in the criminal worlds , was detained by the police , according to postal law .
Gulevich detained in Spain was arrested on trial permission .
Yesterday the Court also arrested three suspects in Estonia .
The suspicion is that members of the so @-@ called Cape Verde criminal association are aged between 27 and 57 , who are mainly responsible for drug crimes .
The alleged leader of a criminal association was detained in Mijamas , Spain .
In Estonia , three men were detained as a suspect , one of whom , according to data , is a leading figure in a criminal association , and two are members of a criminal organisation .
The data collected indicates that there was a clear division of tasks and roles within the criminal community .
The purpose of the criminal community &apos;s activities was to commit drug crimes and thus generate criminal profits , &quot; commented the head of the pre @-@ trial proceedings in criminal matters , the public Prosecutor VasilVerte .
&apos;We are not ruling out that this circle of suspected criminals will increase &apos; , the Prosecutor added .
These are people who have previously taken an interest in law enforcement and some of them have been punished for drug crimes .
Verte stressed that cooperation with my Spanish colleagues has been important throughout the investigation .
&quot; International cooperation has become commonplace for us and this week &apos;s operation shows the success of this cooperation , &quot; said Public Prosecutor Verte .
The head of the Central Criminal Police Department , ago Leis , said that detention was preceded by an investigation going on for nearly one and a half years .
&quot; In the first half of the week , long @-@ standing work became a reality while suspected of committing crimes in Estonia and Spain , &quot; he said .
It added that central police officers were helping with detention in Spain .
For years we have had good contact and understanding of one another with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard .
These detentions are yet another message to the criminals that we can get them from another end of Europe , &quot; said Leis .
The information that has been collected so far makes it clear that , while at large , suspected men can continue to commit new crimes , the public Prosecutor &apos;s office requested and approved them by the Court of Justice .
A man arrested in Spain is awaiting his surrender to Estonia .
Under this criminal case , property , vehicles and cash have been seized in order to ensure confiscation .
The penal preliminary criminal proceedings are carried out by the Central Criminal Police Office for organised crime and are managed by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office .
The Tallinn City Court sentenced Mr Gulevich to blackmail in 2005 and punished him with five years in prison .
In the middle of the last decade , Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the criminal world of Estonia following the then alliances Nicolai Tarankov .
Gulevich from Cape Verde highlighted in Estonian alliances in the early 1990s , when he started extortion in Tallinn .
Admittedly , he taxed taxing taxis and prostitution for various hotels and claimed monthly roofing fees for businessmen .
International joint operations , the confiscation of criminal assets and the entry into force of court judgments confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective .
For example , the most recent judgments , eight defendants of the so @-@ called Dikyev criminal community who were confiscated criminal assets of EUR 80 000 , or nine individuals who were sentenced to the effect that Igor Aleynikov created a criminal association in 2006 aimed at the illegal trade in , and the crime of , contraband and trafficking in human beings in , Eastern and southern Estonia .
The proceeds of crime seized there amount to nearly EUR 71 500 .
In these criminal matters , it has ensured success that police officers exchange information and evidence with their counterparts abroad every day and , if necessary , carry out joint activities in any country of the European Union .
Civil rights group warns Missourisse about travelling
The National Association for the Advanised People of Colored People ( NAACP ) has warned Missourisse @-@ travelling black people against discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the State .
The Group statement states : &apos; The NAACP travel mark for Missouri State , which runs until 28 August 2017 , calls on all African American passengers , visitors and Commons to be particularly attentive and extremely cautious as they move around the State , given the dubious racial events which have taken place recently across the State and which have been highlighted . &apos;
According to NALN , both the recent Missouri law , which makes it more difficult to win cases of discrimination , and the fact that minorities are the targets of state law enforcement to a large extent .
&quot; People &apos;s civil rights are being violated .
They are being pulled off by their skin colour , beaten or slaughtered , &apos; said Ro Chapel , President of the NAACP Missouri branch , to The Kansas City Star .
&apos;We have never received so much complaints before &apos; .
This is the first such warning that an organisation has issued against a US state .
The group &apos;s expression refers to events such as racist insults against black students at Missouri University and the death of the 28 @-@ year @-@ old black story Sandersi , Tennessee .
Sanders died at the beginning of this year under suspicious circumstances , after they had petrol running through the state , and Missouri was arrested without being charged with a crime .
In addition , the comment refers to a recent report by the Chief Prosecutor of Missouri , which shows that the cars of black drivers in the state are 75 % more likely to be stopped than those of the white men .
&apos;The comment is intended to make people aware and warn their families , friends and working partners about what can happen in Missouris &apos; said Chapel .
&apos;People must be ready , whether it means taking bail @-@ in money or informing relatives that they are going through the State &apos; .
The latest information from the FBI Programme on hate crime recorded 100 hate crimes in Missouris in 2015 , placing the State in its sixteenth place as regards the number of similar offences .
A travel warning is also a response to a new law by Missouri , which makes it difficult to appeal to the company &apos;s courts for discrimination in search of housing or work .
Texas and Arizona , the American Civil Protection Union ( American Civil Society Union ) , had previously issued travel notes after these states adopted immigration laws that obliged the local authorities to arrest people for immigration offences because , according to the ACLU , this increases racial profiling .
Normally , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issues travel warnings about other countries , but recently interest groups have started to use this measure as a reaction to certain US laws and trends .
Hepatitis : What would anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease ?
Hepatitis , or liver incineration , may be caused by five different - A , B , C , D and E hepatitis .
All of these viruses provoke a liver violent infection .
However , at an unhealthy cost , hepatitis B and C are chronically chronic and can develop further into a liver circus , the liver horse and the liver cancer .
Siulo Kuwar , an epidemiological Adviser of the Health Agency , states that the phenomenon of acute hepatitis disease is the same for all types of liver @-@ burning - fever , fatigue , plundering , birth , poetisation , dial pain , grey emissions , we are sinking horse mackerel , meat and class pain , and skin and hythollahs .
The crowd name of liver @-@ burning also comes from the last hour of disease .
Children may experience hepatitis without any disease .
The various types of German combustion can only be identified on the basis of laboratory research data .
Over @-@ hepatitis can become chronic hepatitis and go on without disease for decades , which means that you may not know anything about your hazardous liver disease .
Mr Kuwar points out the various forms of hepatitis and describes their evolution in greater detail .
Hepatitis viruses the disease from man to person and infects us when eating contaminated food or drinking the water , by sex , by beating out the infected person and from a handful of foodstuffs , soils , objects , sweets and drug consumption .
A hepatitis infection is caused by family members and carers at risk of disease , people suffering from chronic liver diseases , people who are infected by sex , men who are sex with men , drug addicts , passengers who visit countries with high hepatitis A .
Infection can be prevented by vaccinations , in particular , by recommending vaccination for people who travel a lot and who are at risk of hepatitis A .
In addition , it is important to comply with daily hygiene requirements : To wash or disinfect hands , before being used for food , to wash all fruit and vegetables .
B . Hepatitis viruses ill to come into contact with the blood of human beings , injection of drugs , hepatitis , honour treatment , blood @-@ contaminated fometers ( dentists , means of pregnancy ) , donor blood , hepatitis , sex and hepatitis disease from animals / infants .
Synant drug users at risk of hepatitis infection , sex partners of the infected person , sex men with the infected mother &apos;s newborn , sick family members and carers , blood and other body fluids face health care , rescue workers and police officers and passengers visiting countries with high hepatitis B .
In order to prevent hepatitis , it is possible to vaccinate people ; in particular , it is recommended to vaccinate people at risk , as well as people suffering from chronic diseases , HIV infections , sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes .
B ) The other preventive measures against hepatitis are : Prevention of the use of alien hygiene and manicyms , other therapy tools and needles , reparation and honour , and use of condoms in the event of a dangerous mixture of infection or the prevention of sexual risk behaviour .
Vaccination against hepatitis b is part of the national immunisation scheme and is free of charge for children in Estonia .
Hepatitis C viruses the disease when you are exposed to human blood , injection of drugs , pathogens , honour treatment , blood @-@ contaminated foetal use , donor blood , hepatitis @-@ recipient sex and hepatitis @-@ ill foeder / infant .
Syndrove drug users are at risk of hepatitis C infection , infected people &apos;s sex partners , sex men with men , newborn mothers of the infected mother , sick family members and carers , blood and other body fluids are exposed to health care , bailouts and policemen , persons with HIV infection , and passengers visiting countries suffering from hepatitis .
Hepatitis C is a preventive measure : Prevention of the use of alien hygiene and manicides , other therapy tools and needles , reparation and honour , and the use of condoms in the event of a dangerous mixture of infection .
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C .
Hepatitis D causes hepatitis , a virus which is rife in the presence of hepatitis B .
As a result , hepatitis D suffers from infection with hepatitis B or from chronic hepatitis B as a superinfection .
D hepatitis viruses exposure to blood and other body liquids , contaminated needles , sexually and infrequently infected foetuses .
Hepatitis hepatitis is a chronic hepatitis B virus and non @-@ converts to hepatitis B .
An effective preventive measure is vaccination against hepatitis B vaccine , which also protects people from infection with hepatitis D .
Hepatitis viruses feeble drinking water and food , including little heat @-@ treated beef , fish and marine shellfish , donor blood , collective needles and infected foetuses .
Passengers may be infected by hepatitis in high morbidity countries .
Fpatitis preventive measures include the enforcement of hygiene requirements : Washing or disinfecting hands after beating , before food is made and eaten after sick care .
Fruits and vegetables are washing before consumption , avoiding the feeding of little heat @-@ treated beef , fish and seafood , drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug consumption .
Even though competitors tried to printing off the four @-@ year Olympic winners in the last round , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Farah has found power in the final straight and won 26.49.51 .
Farah did not think for long , drawing the husband , Tania , and children with him after the finch .
This was a special moment for me .
I very much love my family .
They were wonderful to be on their path , &quot; said Farah to the journalists .
Farah aims at the fifth title competition in London , which is running from 5 000 to 10 000 metres of gold .
Everything is possible if there is a belief in it .
In spite of the title , Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;Conimii &apos;s &apos; Daam gold &apos; , a magnificent story of the Climate Bloch @-@ Baueri tree , runs far deeper than the birth of one of the works of art in the late 19th century and early 20th century in Vienna .
But even more in history .
A more narrow subject would have been allowed to have more effect on the extraordinary fodder allowed in the title of a blog .
At the moment , the story of Atel Bloch @-@ Baueri , which was portrayed in Daam gold by some of the cameras , and a much larger and more comprehensive newspaper from esteemed Jewish families and the German occupation , along with its implications in Austria , would be like two books between some of them .
The first third of the book takes a wedding Viin cultural life in the middle of Vienna and who himself entered the Austrian capital , may well imagine how life went around Ringstrass over a hundred years ago or how the Central coffee all turned their heads when the climate came in .
The concentration of cultural figures in one of the richest European cities was a high and well @-@ known name , seeing itself as if it were more like a grams of culture .
However , for example , the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a city in which proliferation of untreated arson and Europe was the highest level of suicides , creates progress as if it were nothing more .
Or perhaps , however , every couple of beauty layers add colour to the early 20th century cultural life in Vienna .
Dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
In the last few decades of the 19th century , the number of Jews had exploded in Vienna , becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe .
Almost one in ten Viin inhabitants had an exchange of views .
The parents , too , were newcomers in Vienna , but by the time the helplessness of Arad was twice opened up with the Czech sugar magnaad Ferdinand Bloch and the Climate for his famous paintings , his father had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire .
But Adelet the whole limorous life to which he belonged was not taken .
When you look at the &apos; Daami gold &apos; , it is hard to believe that , in the end of life , it was infected by a great Lady socialism and dreamt of travelling from the Soviet Union .
By 1933 , when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his husband &apos;s tree climour , the hot month was the paedium in Vienna .
The client ordered at that time cost 4 000 kroons , a quarter of the price of a well @-@ established rural house .
The fact that some of the tree was suspected of having a champion &apos;s parachue with a modelli was not intimidated by a sugar magnate .
As far as Afias is concerned , the only sure fact is that the close relationship between the modelli and the artist that has emerged during the work has continued throughout life .
Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;Connor - &quot; Daam gold .
Mr Bloch @-@ Baueri &apos;s extraordinary story of the Climate Cup , &quot; Varrak 2016 , which translated Aldo Randlands from English .
Shortly before the work with Adelee began , the Climate was visited by Ravenna San Vitale , and the investigators think that the brilliant mosaic mosams that we have just seen there , from Imodora , gave the artist the idea of making a golden tree of Adeletion paved as a mosaic .
The client , in his &quot; Daami gold , &quot; was presented in Vienna in 1968 and around the same time ( from 1907 to 1908 ) , another golden land was born in the &quot; Sue . &quot;
The artistic historians did not lose sight of the similarity of two women .
How is Hitler about nature ?
&quot; I think I owe him to remember my friend Climate to make his work publicly available , &quot; Atel Bloch @-@ Bauer wrote to the Director of the Belvedere Museum in February 1918 to Museum a few years after he left an artist ( Climate died in February 1918 ) and wanted their family &apos;s Climate College to go to a museum .
Six years on from the death penalty , the client had produced another tree .
In his willness ( in February 1925 ) , he also asked her husband to leave her two porters and four Good Climate landscapes to Austrian Galer .
She inherited her sisters to Maria and Luil .
One year after the Climate had finished the &apos; Austrian Mona Annex &apos; , an attempt had been made to get into the Academine of the Kathmandaries of Viin , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Adolf Hitler , but failed in the drawing room .
Even though Hitler &apos;s later anti @-@ Semitism is sometimes considered to have not been accepted by Jewish professors into the Academy , none of his excavators was actually Jews .
In any case , the Austrian Galer , which was referred to in Maria wilment , had become a significant task by 1939 , with the important task of finding pleasing works for the Nazis in Vienna from the rich Jewish arts .
Hitler &apos;s personal artistic wealth also served some work at home , but not that of the climate .
Sixty years after the March of the Nazis , a 10 @-@ year dispute between the Austrian Government and the heirs of the Bloch @-@ Bauer began .
It should only be noted here that , if the &apos; novel &apos; can be seen in the Belvedere Castle in Vienna , Adel Bloch @-@ Bauer &apos;s depiction of the &apos; Daami gold &apos; should be seen as travelling to New York in Neue Galer .
And to read the abovementioned book before Vienna .
Even if you are not going to look at the work of the Climate , my emotions at least revolved around nail and hair rather than the 135 million @-@ dollar @-@ sold painting and moll Adel Bloch @-@ Bauer after the closure of the book .
So it is not so much a married tree , rather than a tribal treasure - and a very moving story .
The orientation of the events at the beginning of the book has greatly facilitated the relatives of the Bauer .
17 @-@ year @-@ old swimming in Canada was very close to the Estonian record
In life , the gold used to be 200 m of insecticide very close to the personal record , swimming 2.2..62 .
The Tippmark dates from a 17 @-@ year @-@ old festival a week ago when the Canadian football Championship won 2.16.58 , Priit Aavik &apos;s Ujumont .
The gold ended up perhaps in ten final zones A @-@ finals .
In the final hall , he went through the distance of 2.15.76 and achieved a good seventh place with a new powerful March of excellence .
The Estonian record for Alina Kendzior ( 2.15.13 ) left the Golden for just over half a second .
The gold went up third in an all @-@ time ranking in Estonia , and its fresh personal peak is the fifth result ever in Estonia .
A young hope for the future lies in the launch of the Canadian adult Championship with 100 m , 200 m and 400 m in whistleblowing and 200 mand 400 m in bundling .
Last week in Toronto , the Canadian football Championic Championship took place and the gold started off there as well .
He won 200 mouths of silver medal during 2.03.22 .
It was so quickly swamped as an act of distance , most recently in 2008 .
Only Estonia &apos;s record , Elina Partarka , has distanced itself from the Golden range faster than ever .
As an Canadian protagonist , Bronksmedal is also won by a 100 m @-@ ballast in a great personal record , with a new Estonian March of peak of 56.66 .
For example , the year @-@ old Kertu ly Alnek of her year @-@ old Kertu has moved away by just one century faster .
He reached a further 100 m in a swimming on his own top mark in an open exchange of known swimming time 1.03.69 .
At a longer distance , it only gained its seventh seat when it drowned in the final assembly at 2.17.31 .
Gold is currently in charge of four different rankings of the Estonian season .
President Trump goes on holiday , critics provide teeth
The time for holidays has come - that also means a relaxation for the US President Donald Trups .
However , since Trump has so far been the President who took the most holiday days , critics are already sparking teeth .
As announced by the US telecom and CNN , a 17 @-@ day holiday is planned by the President at the unspent traditional golf club Bedminster in New Jersey .
Although the President &apos;s leave began yesterday , anti @-@ Trup leave has been spoken about for a week .
They are making too frequent calls for cleansing on the Olympic front .
Indeed , the President has an unspent week exchange time in his Florida , Virginia and New Jersey cotton .
Incidentally , Trump has no longer had the clearest president in his 196 terms of office .
For example , George W. Bush had already reached 67 days on holiday with Barack Obama less than half the Trump but 21 days .
On the other hand , the Olympic Games are tending to forget things quickly .
A few days after becoming President , Trump &apos;s programme called &apos; 60 minutes &apos; said that there would be no time for long holidays for his proposer , because there is a great deal to be done .
He also expressed his outrage at Barack Obama &apos;s leave three years ago .
The current President wrote on Twitter at the time : &apos; While Obama is on holiday , golf , solemn and junior groups are playing on their solemn lines , they cut their heads off their throats &apos; .
A 17 @-@ day golf club visit does not have any relaxation at all , according to officials of the White House .
Instead , it is officially called employment leave , during which the Olympic Games have no time to read or to engage in any other kind of activity .
In addition , leave had to be for another reason .
Namely , the western system of the White House is being replaced and the entire staff therefore had to leave it .
The West wing also hosts the Ovalricane and other presidential offices .
&quot; I do not think any of you would like to be in the West in August if there were 38 degrees and no office pension for the White House , &quot; said Lindsay Walters , the spokesperson for the White House , who stressed that the President would continue to work on holiday .
Where President Trump will spend 17 days next , you will get some idea of a video .
Blocking critics on Facebook : Do not apply for national office unless you tolerate voters &apos; criticism
Our country &apos;s father knew a great deal about unfavourable media coverage .
The Americans loved George Washington , but the newspapers did not go so long as to start haunting him for everything , from internal politics to political principles .
He was , of course , annoyed by the criticism .
But he did not make his critics remain silent .
Because , in 1783 , Washington said that &apos; freedom of expression can be taken away from us and , loudly and quietly , we may be driven to slaughterhouses like sheep &apos; .
That brings me to Maryland &apos;s governor , Larry Hogan , who is struggling to be more Washington @-@ like .
It has blocked and deleted at least 450 posters who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page .
And later this week , he was therefore taken to court by the American Civil Liberties Union ( Civil Liberties Union ) .
The governor of the Governor &apos;s office picked the action empty and web commentates were riddled with counter @-@ reactions in the style of &apos; who would be interested ? &apos;
&apos;That is just Facebook , &apos; many said .
But that is what matters .
And that is particularly important when it comes to a man like Hogan .
It is an astonishingly popular Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state .
His discharge percentage is the second highest among the 50 governors in the country .
It is not an unthinkable whip .
He has stayed firmly in the hands of the state and has stood firm on his principles .
In addition , he has used Facebook as the main tool for communicating with his constituents quite deliberately , for example , by putting his head on the roof for the first time after a chemistry .
Thus , the governor &apos;s cows are a public forum with official marking , managed by the blocking and ultimately dangerous blocking of people who are going to visit people who are paid by taxpayers on dollars .
In an interview with The Washington Posselt , the spokesperson of the Hogan press , defended the behaviour of the governor , claiming that blocking comments was nothing more than moderation .
But it is all too easy to paint a picture of online surgery , spammers , or a nation full of anger .
The post spoke to a number of quite people whose Hogan was blocked .
That is precisely what they are about , in contact with their chosen leaders : The teacher , the company &apos;s owner and passport holder , and not Internet controls .
They all said that their comments were respectable , well thought @-@ out and not black .
Pastor quoted the Bible in his post , oppressing the Hogan Catholic movement .
A lawyer from Bowie , Lakshm Sarma Raman , did not incite hatred but rather hate crimes .
&quot; I made a polite comment that I am disappointed because he has not responded to hate crime or other recent news , &quot; he wrote in the heading of the news story of The mail .
&quot; Nor do I like the idea that if many people comment on the same subject some call it an indifference to a collective effort rather than admit that they are a great many concerned citizens . &quot;
What the governor of the governor called a &apos; targeted spam attack &apos; would probably be summoned by others into &apos; public support &apos; .
The Facebook era can easily reconcile messages by simply blocking criticism or deleting negative comments .
It is much cleaner than it used to be when , in order to do the same , the workers had to be deported so that they could gather and burn the newspapers with critical editorial letters , or arrest the protestors and make them remain silent .
But that is exactly what is happening now , simply in digital terms .
The Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for making Facebook and other social media toothless .
President Trumpi has taken Twitter users to court and has been blocked from Twitter &apos;s stream .
Last week in Virginia , one of the first landmark judgments on this subject .
In Cacheris , US District Judge James C. Alexandria decided that the Chairwoman of the County Board of supervisors of Loudouni broke the first amendment of the constitution when he blocked the constituent on his Facebook page .
In Kenntuckys , as well as the use of ACLU Facebook and Twitter , Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) visited .
It should not be so difficult .
During Washington , affordable postal costs had a similar effect to the Internet .
Between 1776 and 1800 , the number of newspapers and anonymous writers damned in his way of leadership .
Even then , Washington had to deal with anonymous controls .
People wrote letters to newspapers with pseudo @-@ onyms such as Juricola , Valerius , Belisarius and Portius , betraying Washington &apos;s decisions .
On the basis of historical documents collected by George Washington &apos;s web @-@ based project to collect letters , he burned a cabinet under petitions criticising his views on the friendship , trade and shipping agreements with Britain .
However , he did not force them to remain silent .
Freedom of expression , dissent and debate are the foundations of our country .
And proper management means accepting it .
Ronan Rafferty hopes for comfort within the territory of Renaissance
The former European Chairwoman Ronan Rafferty hopes home territory for convenience in the next three days when the East Lothian Renaissance Club &apos;s golf courses are held at 25 .
The Northern Irishman , who was in the vicinity of Archerfield Link &apos;s runners last year on the eve of the last round before Paul Ealousting , is attached to the new scene and is playing the role of Ambassador of the club founder and CEO , Jerry Soledi , as opposed to his seat .
&quot; I saw the Renaissance Club being built , and we are now seeing a club stunning the full breath of the event , &quot; said Rafferty .
&quot; Players see the path in the best possible form , it is in a brilliant state .
Jerry has done an excellent job in establishing this place .
He is a keen supporter of the golf game and proud of what he has achieved here .
It is an excellent opportunity to present the path . &quot;
An Englishman will ever be eager to defend the title for the first time , despite the fact that he has won both European Toubon and the European challenge Toul during his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; It is a very special feeling , &quot; said the beating player in Southport .
&quot; I could not defend my Extremadura Open title because it was taken down the competition calendar one year after my victory .
It is bizarre to come back to this chicken .
This is an excellent place to play at golf .
I remember the memories of last year , for me and for my wife Sharon , last year &apos;s victory was a special one .
It was a very special time , and one that we will always bear in our hearts . &quot;
Gary Orr will also return to the competition on home soil , who joined the European model of segeniuses earlier this year , when he received 50 .
This is his first event in Scotland since the participation of Aberdeen asset Management Scottish Openil in 2013 .
&quot; To play at home is always a little more meaningful , &quot; said Helensburgh &apos;s man Orr .
&apos;That well to speak , but you also know the extra .
I have enjoyed playing again tremendously and I have shown quite a proper golf game .
I am satisfied with the progress that has been made . &quot;
Ian Woosnam and Paul Brok , Roger Chapman , mark James and mark McNulty will join Trio in the square .
Orr and former Ryder carika Captain Sam Torom are two out of six Scottish contests , the rest being Andrew Oldcorn , Stephen McAllister , bill Longmuir and ross Drumond .
Entry is free of charge and car parking costs a passenger GBP 5 and a car with two or more passengers GBP 10 .
All revenues will go to Prostate Caner UK , a charitable organisation .
Poverty and death on Indonesia &apos;s gold @-@ rich land
When Mr Degei &apos;s dinner is produced , he does not use lead .
He even seldom uses a boy .
Indonesia &apos;s tar in a house house in the capital of Papua Paniai Paniac Paniac County will place a bar called the housewife in the local language directly in place of fire .
In half an hour &apos;s time , a breath will be taken from the fire in a drunken sludge and skinned with unscaffed hands .
The Degei is sitting on the other floor floor of the rock it does not have interoperability and , at the same time , it is doing its day @-@ to @-@ day housework there , such as washing the washing water from nearby gender .
The baby plays a role in an untapped room .
As she is a notary of four women of her husband , she has not been condemned to care for anything .
Polygaamia is commonplace here on May .
However , the majority of men in this village may be at risk of being unemployed and many run heavily , plus soldiers .
&apos;nobody dares to go around after 5 o &apos;clock in the village , &apos; says .
This is a rare spectacle in Papua mountain , a former Dutch colony that was added to Indonesia in 1969 after a referendum which caused controversy , forcing only 1 026 old people to vote their hands in front of the troops .
The movement from the upper hand of the Dutch people towards their outrage against the Yakarta Government , which continues to keep the region under strong control , keeping away foreign journalists and human rights supervisors .
In 2003 , the province was officially divided into a Pope and a Western Pope , so that independent Papua New Guinea remained in the east of the island .
In order to get here , the majority is equally distant and deserted , from the capital of the province of Jayapura , to fly 90 minutes of Nabin and then pass a five @-@ hour journey making the rental car navel .
There is no public transport .
A city with around 19 000 inhabitants is made up of tree houses surrounded by breadcrumbs and covers ruminant iron roofs , which have been turned into a different tone into yellow lignite .
Very few indicators have taken the route here , not to mention the journalists , and almost no foreigners have been here either .
Before the Christian missionaries arrived , Mee Pago &apos;s boats marched God with the name of ga Tamee .
Other changes also took place .
&apos;We were not accustomed to wearing such clothes &apos; says Degei , referring to a coded turf of our paint rotation , dark plural and private digestive .
&apos;prior to that , we were wearing only plant cows in the body &apos; .
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line , and the statistics on infant mortality and illiteracy are among the worst in Asia .
However , it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold @-@ rich land .
Just 100 km from Paniao , a mountain province of around 153 000 inhabitants in New Jersey , the world &apos;s largest and most lucrative gold mine , Grasberg , which belongs to FFriday McMoran , a company based in Phoenix .
In 2015 alone , FFriday exports from here extracted around USD 3.1 billion worth of gold and copper .
In addition , Papua can boast of consumer timber stocks worth an estimated USD 78 billion .
However , these riches are the source of the suffering of the boats as they cause the suffocating presence of a powerful Indonesia &apos;s army .
The New York Times study in 2005 showed that between 1998 and 2004 , FFriday &apos;s report paid approximately USD 20 million to local troops and military units , including up to USD 150 000 to one of the officers .
Pope &apos;s efforts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden hall and are handled ruthlessly .
According to human rights activists , more than 500 000 boats have been killed since 1969 and thousands more have been raped , tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesia army .
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission , in the 1970s , the mass killing of genocide in the mountains belonging to Papua tribe was a symptom .
Last year alone , over 3 900 peaceful protestors were arrested by the Indonesia police in the area .
The 2016 Bishops &apos; report &apos; We shall all lose &apos; contains testimony to the atrocities committed last year , such as extrajudicial executions , torture ( according to another report , rape and electric shock are particularly common ) and the brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; The number of victims is difficult to count because such incidents occur every week , &quot; says Andreas Harsono , one of Indonesia &apos;s investigators of Human Rights Watch .
They have been closed even more strongly , as Papua natural resources have caused the influx of new settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia .
83 % of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians , but demographics are changing , with Muslim economic migrants arriving on the islands of Jaava , Kalimantan , Sumatra and Sulawes in Indonesia .
Direct peasants are selling gado @-@ gado @-@ gado vegetables with balcony and mixed vegetables , which are served along with peanuts .
Local communities cannot compete with them .
&quot; Migrants started selling chickens and vegetables more cheaply than local crews on the traditional market , &quot; explain the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Lynne born in Paniai , who moved to Jayapuri , the province &apos;s capital for work .
&quot; Black scooden crews Papua mama @-@ mama &#91; Women &#93; connect to lose their market share . &quot;
The President of Indonesia , Joko Widodo , known as Jokow among the people , pledged in his 2014 election campaign to address these inequalities and human rights violations in Pope .
The former pump won 27 constituencies , including Paniai , on his way to the presidential Palace of Jakarta in Papua 29 .
But the Pope has changed very little and the local people feel deceived .
&quot; Our hearts have been broken because in 2014 , we voted for Jokow in the expectation that he would live up to our hopes of a return to justice , &quot; says &apos; You will .
In fact , only two months after Jokow took office in October , Paniai was in a low state .
On 7 December 2014 , 11 children in the majority of the world staged on Christmas when two Moroccan soldiers appeared on a motorcycle out of their darkness .
They were told by grieved children that they should include the front lights .
According to what the local pastori Yavedt Thani said , one of the soldiers insulted their tone and subsequently returned with four soldiers .
According to the victims and spectators , drunk soldiers hunted behind their children and deceive them with their guns .
One soldier then shot among children .
One child , Yulianus Yeimo , aged 16 , was beaten so courageously that he fell into the Chamber .
A few hours later , the nearby electoral Commission building was set on fire , and the next day things escalated even more .
Around 1 000 young men , women and children gathered in a football pitch in front of a local police station and a military command centre in order to demand justice .
They weed white buses for repairs and presented Papua mee pago tribe for waita @-@ tanker , during which a round was run and a song of poultry was buried .
Some protesters started to whitewash on the police and the military .
On the fallout of anger , an order was sent to the soldiers via an internal stadium : &apos; When a crowd is more than three times resisting , let them down , &apos; was stated in an official document , which has been seen by the magazine on time but has not been issued to local media publications .
Older Yeremias Kayam ( 56 ) , in the town of Kego Koto , the city of the majority , felt threatened and called for peace to be maintained by asking for the population to go home .
No one had the will to listen .
&apos;When I was suddenly shot in the left , &apos; said to the magazine in his private breadcrumbs on the shelf of the tree .
We still do not know who the firmer was , but say that the month came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered .
&apos;There was a lot of people , there were plenty of lasts in the industry , &apos; he adds .
Alfius Youw , a local man , has seen him shot down three times .
&apos;Let me come to him and look through his body to make sure that it is with him , &apos; said the magazine at length in Yohanes , who , like many other indicators , use only one name .
&apos;I saw that he has died ... I visited him &apos; .
The chief inspector of Papua police , Yotje Maks , told the reporters that he only guaranteed the security of his department because it was attacked .
&apos;We must defend ourselves when we are threatened with killing &apos; said Pudjo Sulistiyo , Commissioner for Police Sulistiyo in 2015 .
&apos;That is a matter of life and death &apos; .
According to Human Rights Watch , five young protestors were killed and many injured .
The news of the killings only reached Jakary the next day .
Three weeks later , Jokow Jayapura made an impassioned speech in which he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and allowed abuses that took place in Pope to be dealt with .
&quot; I want to resolve this case straight away so that it will never happen again in the future , &quot; he said .
Mr Wiranto , Minister for Security , said in October 2016 that he would put in place an alternative mechanism for the resolution of crimes against human rights .
But the excuses almost immediately followed .
&quot; Most crimes happened a long time ago .
Some took place in the 1990s and early 2000s .
The point is that we are committed to resolving these crimes , but we have to follow certain processes , &apos; he said .
However , speaking in Jakarta on 5 June , Wiranto took his words back , saying that he had no intention of creating a Pope mechanism to deal with complaints .
Instead , he said , &apos; everything is done according to the law &apos; .
Wiranto , who has been indicted by the UN for crimes against human rights by more than 1 000 people in East Timor during the bloody referendum on independence in 1999 , said that 11 crimes against human rights had already been resolved in Pope , including in Paniai .
The families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with gloomy mistrust .
&quot; I have been interrogated four times over the last three years but no progress has been made , &quot; said Yohanes .
&apos;I am tired &apos; .
He says that years later , he still lives in fear .
&apos;I am afraid , &apos; he says .
&apos;I am afraid the army is arresting me , I am afraid I am being shot &apos; .
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view that the Paniai people are fearful of this episode .
He said that he had been beaten by the army after helping to bury the four victims .
&apos;Following the buried bodies , the army had to look for me , &apos; he says .
Arrests have not ceased .
On Tuesday in Deiyais , the people of Indonesia &apos;s village district of Paniai were shot in a neighbouring regeneration .
One person was killed and 17 wounded , including children , when it went to war between the head of the village population and the head of the construction company , who refused to transport an unconscious man to hospital .
This man , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Rikuanus Douw , who drowned into a nearby river seeking fish , died on his way to hospital .
Blind village inhabitants protested at a construction site in front of the company &apos;s office .
According to the police , village people stoned policemen and the latter responded by means of alerts .
However , according to local claims , a mobile brigade ( a militant police driven by Indonesia ) started firing at the people , killing one person .
&apos;We were in great scaremongering , we are afraid of reprisals , &apos; said the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Domingge Badii , who lives near a hospital and saw those injured induced .
&apos;I have beaten myself in my own house for two days &apos; .
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the police involved to be held accountable and for the police to be withdrawn from the region by the mobile brigade .
Paniai has always been a problem for the Government of Indonesia .
The absence of any meaningful development feeds the dissatisfaction of the honey , mone , dangon and Sudanese tribes living in Papua halium .
Many of them have joined an army of free Papua ark ( VPL ) rebels which , according to its own words , protects the rights of boats by appalling assaults and kidnappings on the part of Indonesia &apos;s soldiers .
Some VPL leaders come from Paniao , including Tadius Yog and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .
In response , the army has been arresting in Paniai over recent years and arbitrarily arresting thousands of people on the pretext of &apos; defending state sovereignty &apos; .
Some of them will never appear again .
Paniades are known as &apos; a tragic forgotten place &apos; among Papua people .
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction .
The small rice that is sold in the majority of the wheel is too expensive to buy at local level .
I find the same unattainable .
People themselves cultivate all their food online as a basic breadcrumbs , as well as some fruit and leather vegetables .
Farming is a job for women , each of whom can care for four or five baseline fields .
They usually keep most of the harvests in the family , the rest being sold on the local market .
Only 10 bases cost 10 000 Indonesia &apos;s premises ( 75 cents ) .
Over time , economic inequalities have widened between underground boats and new migrants , who have come a great deal since the opening of new routes at Nabire Airport .
The few jobs that exist go better to more well @-@ educated and richer migrants .
The Pope himself often lacks the capital or the necessary skills to conduct a competitive business .
&quot; Young people are not interested in staying in the village because there are no jobs or money here , &quot; says John Gobai , President of the Paniai tribe Council .
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from the Pope .
In addition , strict restrictions remain on foreign media .
Earlier this year , French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Pope because &apos; they did not follow the relevant practices &apos; had been granted a rare film authorisation .
The election promises made by Jokow , Vice @-@ President of the Asian department of Human Rights Watch , to remove the restrictions on reports to promote transparency and development have not been implemented .
&apos;In Indonesia , journalists trying to report in Papua most eastern provinces and Western Pope , are threatened with new threats of rejection and blacklisting , &apos; he said in his statement .
The lack of a look at the press means that the international pressure on the government of Indonesia is largely limited to Papua i &apos;s immediate neighbours .
In March , six of the Pacific States pushed the Pacific Ocean countries to explore the &apos; United Nations Human Rights Council - crimes on a broad scale &apos; , including the shooting of Paniao , Nauru , Belau , Tupain , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands .
These same countries have also historically supported VPL .
Arrmanatha Nasir , spokesman of the Indonesia Ministry of Foreign Affairs , dismissed the group &apos;s accusations , saying to the press in Jakartas : &apos; Democratic order still exists in Indonesia and freedom of the press , so that evidence of human rights cases would be hard to bury &apos; .
The local people want more foreign governments to be taken on board .
When an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the country &apos;s human rights Envoy , Mr Van Bar , visited Jayapura on 4 May , the local people interrupted their silence , according to the source of their desire to remain anonymous , urging &apos; we want freedom &apos; .
In Indonesia , new presidential elections will be held in 2019 , but boats do not believe they will vote for Jokow again .
&quot; Jokow is a well @-@ intentioned man , but he is surrounded by people linked to the shooting of Paniai , &quot; says Hobai , President of the tribal Council .
He wants to tell Jokow that not only do the people of Paniai live under the threat of a constantly predatory army , but they are struggling with misery due to poor education and health services .
According to Gobai , the people of Paniai , like other boats , regard their vote to Jokow as their debt to be paid .
&apos;They do not need money , they want justice , &apos; he says .
Despite threats and intimidation , the families of the Paniai bombers managed the last token revolt of insurgency , swept away one of the victims &apos; bodies , and the military bases responded to the land they had .
Knowing that justice may never be put on its feet , at least they will not allow those responsible to forget their crimes .
&apos;One of our family members has been killed , &apos; says Yacobus with a besieged head .
&apos;What else can we do ? &apos;
Come in for the second time under Dubai Torch photographer
On Friday , hundreds of inhabitants of this 337 metres desert and escape from the 79 tidal buildings were fed through one of the world &apos;s highest residential towers in Dubai .
This is another fire that has ravaged the High Representative for just two years , which , incidentally , is called Turin , or Tharvikup .
None of the injuries were reported and no direct fire occurred .
&quot; We sleep and woke up with fires and people shouting .
We would be travelling down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor , &apos; said Reuters a resident who called himself George .
According to Dubai civil protection officials , the fire @-@ fighters also deleted the site at around 4 o &apos;clock in the morning at local time ( 00.00 GMT ) and refrained the building .
The government said that it was working to provide shelter to those affected .
This episode may once again raise questions about the safety of high @-@ calibre materials used across the world .
An investigation carried out in the wake of the 2015 Tuch Management Board into the fire found that the most damage was caused by the façades , the off @-@ shore decoratory panels and isolation .
The British police have said that they believe that the isolation of the London Grener Tower and the façer panels could contribute to the rapid spread of the fire that went on there in June , killing around 80 people .
See : Such phones are expected to become sales sites in the autumn
Complex and autumn is the time for technical Afghans to display their new models of excellence .
In the spring , Samsung Galaxy S8 , Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia Premium came for sale , and in the autumn too new hitt @-@ phones are expected for boys .
&quot; Thanks to telecoms 2 marketing and sale Director , CSjan Semother , this year &apos;s flagships are characterised by an innovative design , an eye @-@ hall , a screen with a 4K resolution on the server @-@ servani , and a super @-@ fast process manager .
Samsung Galaxy S8 gave rise to a great deal of excitement in the technological world , which has also reached the top of the sale table for smartphones in Estonia .
The autumn will allow even more strained recharging , more resilient battery , better quality cameras and greater water and pollination for smart citizens .
He added that the rumours could already speculate and predict four models of excellence that will probably conquer streets .
These four &quot; smart phone top &quot; models will end up on supermarket shelves later this autumn .
The long @-@ awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach the shops as early as mid @-@ September .
However , rumours of what the new Apple model looks like and what can be done about it are spreading greatly .
While the iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences between iPhone 6s , on the occasion of the tenth birthday of Apple , it is expected that the new model will be completely different from previous ones .
Four colours have been mentioned : Black , white , rosé gold and chromium .
One of the elements of the new design is probably the screen , which covers the entire telephone headway , has lost the dog and the fingerprint readers have been built on the screen .
JonyIve , the head of design of Apple , demands that the new iPhone model look like a glass .
There has also been talk of an iPhone ceramic version .
In addition to the novels of the GV , unmanageable recharging and an even better quality camera , a faster A11 process can be expected .
This is certainly one of the year &apos;s anticipated smartphones .
On 23 August , the preliminary order of the brand new model Galaxy rou8 begins .
There have been many rumours about what the new Galaxy rou8 will look like .
Admittedly , even more business users have been targeted and the S pen allows for even greater functionality .
There should be two cameras on the phone , one being a laissez @-@ jerk and the other an object of television with a narrower view .
No one yet knows what the two taboos are capable of , but in any case this is Samsung &apos;s first test , which is certainly comparable in terms of quality to the iPhone 8 .
We are , however , eagerly awaiting 23 August .
Although Nokia has put three smartphones on sale this year , headed by Nokia 6 , there is still a shortage of their flagships , Nokia 8 , which are already to be presented on 16 August .
We expect a screen running from Nokia to 5.3 p.m. and an ultra @-@ fast Qualcomm Skardragon 835 processor and a more durable battery .
Nokia also talks about aluminium corps and significant levels of water and pollination in IP68 .
Like Samsungi , the new model of Nokia has two taboos , an optimist produced by Zeiss .
If Sony @-@ certain flagships have been XZ Premium to date , the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smart phones with even more innovative features will soon be included .
We are waiting for a smartphone that is slightly more modest than XZ Premium , but at least just as good or better as a camera .
For the new model of Sony , there has been speculation that its screen is at least cumbersome .
What reality will bring us to see very soon , as Sony has traditionally made its autumn flagships public at the IFA International Technology Fair , which will take place this year from 1 to 6 September .
Trump Mexico was pressurised to pay for the border wall , according to the transcriptors who leaked telephone calls .
The Washington post unveiled transcriptions of telephone calls between US President Donald Trumpi and Mexican and Australian heads of state .
On 27 January , Trump &apos;s telephony to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto called on him to stop proclaiming that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall .
He was crushed by the American President for publicly condemning the Wall by saying , &apos; You must not say this to the press &apos; .
Trump raised his presidential campaign &apos;s promise to build a along the southern border with the United States of America &apos;s wall and age to make Mexico pay for this project .
It also published transcriptions of his first speech with the Australian Prime Minister , Malcolm Turnbull , which reveal a tense debate .
Trump told the Turuneasy that the agreement by the United States of America to take in refugees to Australia was &apos; ludicrous &apos; , &apos; nervous &apos; and &apos; stupid &apos; ; he said that the agreement made under the Obama Government would give him the impression of a &apos; guide &apos; as he has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States .
The Trump cut off by telling the Turner that &apos; it was the day &apos;s most unpleasant speech &apos; .
The National Court did not prosecute the city of Liines , the town of OC MRP , for having rejected their offer for bus and coach transport between July 2019 and 2029 .
It is a handbook rejecting the offer made by the city of Liines Tartu bus procurement , the city of OC MRP , because the offer did not meet the requirements , An4 Aputin , the head of the Tartu City Law Service , explained .
It is a procurement of public bus and coach services within the city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019 @-@ 30.06.2029 .
The city of Liines of MRP has taken a ruling before the Civil Court of Tartu .
It was not prosecuted by the National Court .
Although many in the social media complain that their night is disturbed by the Weekend festival and the whole city is full of drunk brakes , there are also many who do not have a single bad say on the ongoing festival on the floor .
I am even positively surprised that the supermarket had such a courtesy !
I did not see any misgivings or miscourtesy .
Even out of generosity , I saw a huge wave of words .
&apos;Well , it &apos;s all very well to have come , to be and to be happy with Persian - a farm like the wagons - &apos; , he will be happy to add .
The thorny wave of rubbish does not bother .
While he still heard in a central town that music would be played on the beach , music has not yet reached his home intentional level .
&quot; But I hope I hear , he says cheerfully .
Also , in Agnes , who talked about the Academy , the Grand Festival is more of a good thing for Persian - it makes a significant contribution to the turnover of local merchants .
In addition , he welcomes the fact that the village has come to such an extent by the summer capital .
The pregnant woman has no problem .
Even though I am no longer on the beach , it is nice that the rand has revived .
And it &apos;s good that the people are moving , and that has been the case three times now &apos; , a woman says .
I think the first time was perhaps a little worse .
&apos;Well , maybe there were complaints &apos; , he is wondering .
He said that what happens on the beach was normal for the summer capital cities .
&apos;This Weekend is a very good promo for our small city , &apos; speaks of Harr on board .
Neither life nor the möll has stunned his life yellow .
But for you ?
We should all economise .
Give some thought to how this inter @-@ ethnic communication would be better .
The artist does not shake the whistle .
It does not work , even though I live near it .
&apos;Good people can make savings and there is no misfortune &apos; , he speaks .
Guests who have arrived in Persian are polite , as he said .
&quot; With bottles , of course , they are a little exaggerating , but young people are a young man and a man &apos;s God - give you to go , but be people and do it ! &apos; He says .
The people on the coast have travelled somewhere by then , whether with relatives or with acquaintances .
&quot; But in general , the festival has a positive impact on life - people like this meal , &quot; Tiina , who speaks to children .
His family &apos;s und festival does not bother either , even though last year it did not go even further than it was today .
Last summer there was another stage , then we heard more .
We live out of the city itself that it is actually a long way off the coast of the Persian River , &quot; he talks .
Pearson cuts another 3 000 jobs and reduces dividends to revitalise business
The British education company Pearson said on Friday that it would cut another 3 000 jobs and reduce its intermediate dividends by 72 % , thereby launching another restructuring programme to deal with the threat to business .
In all probability , according to the CEO , John Fallon , at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , will add 4 000 posts lost during the previous restructuring .
Pearson announced in May plans to cut costs by a further GBP 300 million ( USD 394 million ) under the third expenditure reduction programme to try to revive a business that has been hit by the transition to rapid digital learning .
The company , which agreed to sell last month to its partner company Penguin Random House , Bertelsmann , said that their expectation of a year has not changed since a 1 % increase in sales profits was announced in the first half of the year to GBP 2.05 billion .

Attack in Kabul : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
The suicide bombers attacked military convoys in the Afghan capital , Kabul , killing a NATO soldier and wounding several others .
The NATO statement said that five soldiers and interpreters were injured .
Three civilians were also killed in an incident in the town of Qarabaghi , according to unconfirmed local reports .
This bombardment is the last of the acts of violence that have befallen Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in the Herat mosque attack .
On Monday , two people were killed by a suicide bomber in Kabul , near the Iraqi Embassy .
The statement by NATO said that there was an explosion on Thursday evening when joint patrols with the Afghan army were assaulted &apos; a man @-@ made explosive body &apos; .
The statement states that everything is in a stable position and is being treated at Bagram airport in a US military hospital .
According to reports , the ever @-@ growing forces in Qarabaghi , the Taliban and group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State in Bagrai , are a source of serious concern to NATO forces in Bagram .
According to UN data , at least 1662 civilians have died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , of whom nearly 20 % in the capital city .
At the end of July a car bomb in Kabul was killed by at least 30 people , mainly in the Shi &apos;ite line .
The Taliban said they were behind the attack .
On 31 May more than 150 people were killed by a major bomb attack in the centre of the city , which has resulted in the most deaths in the military attack in the country since the US @-@ led forces rejected the Taliban in 2001 .
This violence highlights the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , while the US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops helping the country &apos;s military and police .
According to correspondents , the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public crisis of confidence in the government , its policies , and especially in President Ashraf Ghan .
The EPA subsequently annulled the decision to postpone the ski regulation
The United States Environment Protection Agency ( United States Environmental Protection Agency ) annulled its decision to delay the introduction of a Obama regulation obliging states to limit emissions from the summer , one day after 15 states were taken to court by the agency .
The EPA announced the decision to proceed late on Wednesday with the &apos; 2015 ozone @-@ content @-@ setting procedures &apos; , saying that it shows the Agency &apos;s commitment to cooperating with the states .
&quot; We believe that we need to have a dialogue and listen to our state partners , &quot; said Scott Pruitt .
Pruit was announced in June by the EPA &apos;s intention to postpone the ozone @-@ content levels in interoperability in order to determine in different parts of the country where this level should be reduced by one year until 2018 , in order to meet the highest air quality standard .
15 main democratic states , together with the Columbia district , brought an action on Tuesday , saying that the decision was illegal .
President Donald Trumpi &apos;s government has tried to pull back many of the environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama , which , according to Trumpn , are part of a more comprehensive plan for reviving economic growth .
However , these efforts have provoked reactions among the democrats and nature protection groups concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health .
The EPA website states that inhaling the ozone @-@ containing air can &apos; reduce lung working capacity and increase the risk of respiratory diseases &apos; , such as asthma .
German pigs may come from a pipe .
German pigs and bovine animals can be caught because heavy rain is threatening the catch of the second largest wheat producer in the European Union , Bisberg writes .
This year , it may be the case that for weeks before harvesting , fruit intended for the bread industry can only eat the animals .
&quot; Content quality is far worse than soil and worse than in 2015 , &quot; said the Agravis Raiffeisen analyhard Merla analysis .
This year , up to 40 % of German wheat for animal feeds , which is double the standard , was forecast in Agrav .
German farmers , like their European colleagues , have come across all kinds of beauty this year .
First of all , the winter was too dry .
Then came the spring , which was replaced by heatwave in June .
In July , Germany hit the German sails , which have continued in August .
Many eyes are on Northern Germany , where the rain hampers harvests .
So far , only five per cent of wheat has been multiplied .
The majority of the region has not even reached the harvest level , announced the buyer of the local harvest in Ceravis .
&apos;That is quite a difficult day , &apos; said Frank Deckert Rendsburg , a senior trader in Ceravis .
Consistency in everything , in other words , cumbersome bricks for Finns &apos; internal design
In Kaunia , nature plays its part in the twinning surfers , because through large windows the equated views of the Saimaa fishermen reach many of the rooms ( life ) .
Every step in the face of the aspiration of our northern neighbours to create both savage and perfect ( energy @-@ saving ) homes .
The ability to use Finns &apos; timber as construction and processing materials , furniture and beauty are worthy of compliance .
Virtual techniques and clever solutions can be found in twinning houses , both the builder and ( home ) designer .
It is clear there that the composition of black , white and grey bottles , if they are supplemented by wood tones and food plants , can be very desperate .
There are still good ideas open for a week to come because the Fair will run until 13 August .
Suppliers and herbs suggest that this kitchen is often copied .
Seoul today &apos;s drawing line for Weekend Festival Baltica and Martin Garriga has done his utmost to remember as the last speaker .
The people were really revolving when Mr Garriga was speaking - the song , the song , the air , the danced .
When Garriga x ended , a single mass of Persian beach was disbanded over the city .
Let us bring you to the gallery , where you have all the pictures that tried on Weekl our photographer for three days together .

Mainy Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time and discuss possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mainy Garcia , who should be on the collision course to face up to the most attractive boxing category for the near future , met for the first time on Thursday .
In Lomachenkot &apos;s office in LOS Angeles , as long as Garcia , the unwinning World Boeing &apos;s lightweight champion , walked to the other end of the corridor , to welcome Lomachenkot , the World Bomainzationi sulgeriot .
After the unanimous decision of Garcia , both combatants are at the top five of the weighted table table at the former four @-@ time world champions Adrien Bronger .
Ms Garcia extended her better hand and said , &apos; How does you go , champion ?
I wish you every success . &quot;
Lomachenko protects his belts against Miguel Marries on Saturday evening at 19 ESPN .
When a few photographs were available , the Mayor of Lomachenko , Egis Climate , stated that there would be a &apos; perfect measurement &apos; of the confrontation between the militants .
&quot; I am a former consultant , &quot; recalled by Garcia .
&quot; I rise for Bronger &#91; to 63.5 kg &#93; , but I am not so large .
I am small for 63.5 kg .
I want to move below the weight of lightweight .
And it must move upwards with lightweight &#91; 61.2 kg &#93; and then we can fight .
Fans have asked for this .
Then let us offer them that . &apos;
Lomachenko agreed .
&apos;The boxing world needs this fight &apos; .
( Es ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the climate raised the question as to whether it should be cost @-@ effective , as part of his strategy of allowing Lomachenkol to debate at the end of this year a class of 61.2 kg to make it possible to meet with Garcia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 noses ) by next summer , who also has an interest in combating Jorge Linarese and Luke Campbell &apos;s match winner after their lightweight in Foruel on 23 September .
&quot; Looking at this fight could be cost @-@ effective , as fans have asked for this confrontation , &quot; said Garcia at a later date , saying that he was open to any channel that offers the best financial package .
&quot; We are the main actors .
No other name can attract so much attention .
Whichever time they are prepared ... &apos;
Garcia said that he considered Lomachenkot to be a &apos; powerful fighter &apos; and that he could go to see his match from Saturday to Saturday .
Mr Lomachenko , in praising Mrs Garcia , was timid when she said that she thought that the champion of the three divisuals from Riverside was &apos; very slow ; sorry , Mainy ... you wanted this novels &apos; .
According to Garcia , the aim was to show strength and then to hang .
They both affirmed that they felt the pressure is growing to try their way out of strength .
&quot; This is a fight that we need to make a reality .
No other confrontation arouses so much attention and attention .
I am more than willing to work towards this , &apos; said Garcia .
Lomachenko said , &apos; I have been waiting for the best militants and Mainy has just done that .
This will be a good fight . &quot;
Which of the world &apos;s beaches to Estonia is being relocated ?
Last year , the Police and Border Guard ( PPA ) granted a record number of over 13,000 residence permits to third @-@ country nationals who have largely travelled to Estonia for work , study or family .
When , for example , a fixed @-@ term residence permit was decided on at least 6702 foreigners , this figure was 4928 .
The services cannot tell how many immigrants will eventually remain permanently in Estonia , but such an analysis will be prepared in the Ministry of the Interior .
While nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia ten years ago , in recent years this figure is close to 2 000 .
The number of applicants for residence permits increased exponentially during the Ukrainian crisis with 1087 fixed @-@ term residence permits in 2014 , up from 675 in the previous year .
According to the statistics office , in Estonia , the highest number of Ukrainian citizens is growing - 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia last night more than left .
&quot; The Ukrainian community has always been big in Estonia and , due to difficult circumstances , it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many families are already facing it , &quot; said Kristin Rammus , spokesman of the Interior Ministry .
In total , the number of Ukrainians granted a fixed @-@ term residence permit was higher than the number of Russian citizens , despite the fact that in 10 years , the latter have been granted the most fixed @-@ term residence permits .
When the Ukrainians largely come to work here , Russian citizens for family migration .
&apos;Given the historical Russian community here , they are also most likely to have the greatest family ties with people living in Russia &apos; , the Internal Protection Academy Helina Meing , said .
&apos;If you look at where Russian citizens who have been granted a residence permit in Estonia have moved to , after Hartland , Eastern Viruony &apos; , he added and pointed out that around 40 % of them were married by a European Union citizen .
The soil was granted a fixed @-@ term residence permit of 1696 Russian citizens , which is also a record number .
At the same time , the number of Russians who wanted to prolong their residence permit decreased .
&quot; Compensation is the result of a new residence permit for Estonia being requested rather than an extension of the residence permit , &quot; said Rammus , spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior , who said that the interest of Russian citizens in Estonia &apos;s residence permit has remained stable for years .
The new residence permit for Estonia will allow foreigners who have lived here for at least three years to apply for it since last year .
Its aim is to encourage the sincere saving of people who have adapted .
However , a long @-@ term resident permit requires , for example , five years .
The extension of the old residence permit has obviously been reduced because of the new residence permit .
Last night , for example , such a residence permit was granted to Ukrainians , who have been working here for at least three years .
The Ukrainians will now be able to change their jobs , and the Estonian state will no longer point the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met .
This residence permit became a lever - holders of last year &apos;s bad passport ( 1029 ) , Russians ( 487 ) , Indians ( 54 ) and nigers ( 36 ) .
In total , 1968 people were granted a residence permit to live in Estonia , including 23 Americans , 12 Egyptians , 18 Georgians and as many Chinese .
The first half of this year is already 1269 .
In 10 years , Nigeria has become , surprisingly , a country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for its residence permit .
In 2007 , when three residence permits were issued for young people , the soil was 200 .
Nigeria comes here to study at universities .
Other higher education institutions in Estonia are popular among Georgians , Chinese and Turks , for example .
The number of citizens from India , Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen largely thanks to learning games .
For them , too , the rule is that where there is a community in advance , there will be others there more easily , &quot; Rammus added .
For 10 years , two people have also moved to Estonia from , for example , North Korea , just as much from Laos and Madagascar .
Ten people have come here from Cuba , 231 from South Korea , 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay .
If around 6 000 third @-@ country nationals get a residence permit a year , that is about 0.46 % of the total population .
Even if we add to the citizens of the European Union , migration remains about a percentage , &quot; said the Meuse that , in fact , the numbers were small .
In total , 14 822 people emigrated to Estonia , out of which 13 792 , according to the statistics office .
This means that immigration has overtaken a second year of emigration .
Most of those who leave and move are Estonian citizens , but there are more among those who leave .
As a result , Estonian citizens &apos; migratory bubble of 2 000 people was negative .
Estonians in particular migrate between Finland and Estonia .
The Prince of Mong Couture triggers sacks , chickens and sweat
However , there is still history for Maria Tampere in the abundance of ideas - old paintings and defendants : &apos; I can dream for hours somewhere in the museum and admire the old thieves and crats .
If you take a brick line , you will study and learn every day about it .
That is a joy of discovery !
The Mong Couture glamorous world may seem like a life @-@ alien , but the designer does not think so .
You yourselves decide how much your life is !
As a friend , I am a friend with a whole saun full of my sharks of couture .
Because it is not his fault that he does not live in Hollywood and does not go to a red horse every day ; he wants to wear these most beautiful brokers , too !
You yourself will be able to live your life special !
The Moeartist does not recognise the gap between shining events and bad day .
It was this reasoning that led to the rolling @-@ out of the plan to take the high @-@ profile in Estonia into the countryside , between forests and fields , between the people who often cannot be reached .
For example , a collection was presented on a comparison , Jair and Perka moealleel , where the Queen of the Queen of 45 models filled the entire street .
In Tallinn , you are often taken in in the shop , nodding with dignity , but elsewhere there is more emotion : Shouting bBravo , rising up ; you want to thank you with compassion .
Much of the audience had to be curious , but they are now Mylong Couture fans .
If you live up to the expectations of the people , they are overjoyed !
And I like the feeling that I am with my fashion at the summer recess .
Pernus had a 50 @-@ metre red carpet , full of rubbish along the street , seemed not to have come to an end !
Maria also does not recognise the motive that creation has to be presented by a superstall ; she will be happy to bring about ordinary women .
I often invite my own customers - they have always been happy .
That is how lax the experience : You have found a wonderful knife on the stage !
I am so sorry that I , myself , have never seen my play ; after all , I am always behind the shelf in order to give things my last breath as a hopeless actionist .
My nerve would not allow a peaceful eye on the floor .
Mrs Maria is the artist of this kind , who not only wants to play a representative role , but also to be present in everything .
I have my mesh machine on the radio , most of the collections being carried out myself .
I like the whole process where you have played with details , you will find it .
I am never a long way from my nature and I am not afraid of work .
It is not a matter of discipline , nor is it a matter of style , logistics , organisation , organisation , organisation - everything has to slide away from a single woman &apos;s day .
Well , the fanatics are still doing a huge amount of work .
I cannot say when my working day will end , but for me it is simply a day of joy !
I am still very lucky - it is like an unceasing fortune : I do something nice , man gets something beautiful and , in turn , compliments .
It has been said several times that my brothers have a magic treasure : They make themselves felt like a princess .
The abundant , disgusting crucifixes that made Maria talent inaudible overnight have stayed to this day in the form of Couture signals .
Martin Myrsep of U18 boys : An alagrostar weapon of Estonians has now been turned against us .
Damage , fairy tale has run out .
The first thing that came to light was that we were not able to get our desks on our desks .
And when such a big difference has to be made on the table , &quot; Estonia commented 61 on U18 Corvpallians : 75 British opt @-@ outs to Britain &apos;s only Korvpaller , BC Kalev / Cramo abitreener Martin Myrsep .
The opponents took 28 balls out of the attack and , as a result , received so many more attacks .
Nor were we prepared for their aggressive defence or attack ; it created it .
Many Englishmen &apos;s assaults came to an end in three to five seconds ; we were unable to build up protection .
However , in defence , they were able to keep their hands there , we could not combine them .
It got the team back on its feet .
The housework of the opponents was better done .
Myrsepa estimates that Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to take the opponent out in the breath .
The last quarter - we had a zero error , but the opponents had already received several quick times .
Admirability and intense insistence , which was the Aagrostar &apos;s weapon , have now turned against us all .
Today , we had no strength against their aggressiveness .
Myrsep remained satisfied with his negligence in Kalevis , Matthias Tassi .
In general , tourism can say good words about the whole team ; until now , there has been a single shock .
It is a pity that such an aggressive response had not been met before .
Tasty has always been self @-@ confident and played out today , but he seemed to have been tired - he has carried quite a great burden .
But he made some quite beautiful moves , which I have seen in trends in the past , &quot; added the mentor .
Horrendous numbers : The Corvpallier of kidneys in EM turf searched less than 10 points with three quarters ...
In the U18 age classes , not only do the Corvpalliturniir of emi B @-@ divisjon , in Tallinn , where she started in Dublin the day before yesterday .
And yet Estonia &apos;s game with Poland was bitter in the area of antiquescorts .
Estonia lost 25 : 65 , but after a third quarter , the state of play was 9 : 49 , that is to say only in the last 10 minutes , the opponents took their feet from the gas peat , with a delay of 16 to 16 .
Estonia &apos;s 4 , 1 points ( 3 ) were outlined in both the first and the second quarter ...
In so doing , the Estonians initially caught two pieces from the first four of them in two minutes , and then two of the four titles in the first two , but 25 pieces of the game , then one in the troika and then another 21 throw over ...
Perhaps for almost half an hour , one of the 47 whistleblows was taboo .
In addition , two points came from four free tones .
The losses at that time were a reasonable figure of 12 .
By the end of the game , Poland &apos;s hit hit 33 % and Estonia had 13 % ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has started to lose two , and Portugal &apos;s 83 : 56 best had to be recognised on the opening day .
NATO vessels came to Tallinn to replenish stocks
Today , NATO &apos;s 1 permanent anti @-@ personnel group has arrived in Tallinn for the weekend on a planned port visit to improve ship stocks and prepare for the forthcoming exercise .
During their visit , ships are preparing for a return at sea , while allowing crew members to take pairant leave .
Following the visit , NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters in order to carry out a number of exercises and to be ready for future historical explosive operations .
&quot; The participation of Estonians in a NATO unit and the co @-@ training they carry out in local waters is a good illustration of our integration into allied forces , &quot; said the Commander of the Operation and Planning unit of the navy Commander , Arto Reinland .
Since 29 June , NATO is leading the Latvian navido Laudups , captain @-@ General of the Latvian Navy , at a ceremony in Riga to take over the tasks of the Commander from the Estonian navy officer Johan @-@ Elias .
The group &apos;s flagships are LVNS Virsaitis , the Latvian navy support ship , which also has a group lead star .
During this semester , the Estonian naval soldier , Sakharov , is also part of the international unit .
As one of the four groups of vessels subject to the NATO naval command , NATO is the 1 permanent anti @-@ personnel group that is part of the primary rapid reaction unit , which can be sent within five days to different parts of the world by the Alliance .
4 . - Over 13 August , the ancient ruins of the Pirita monastery will once again become the place where the Maestro Eri Kestival , called by Birgitta Festival 13 years ago , will be deserted .
This year , Burma &apos;s Festival , the artistic leader of Tallinn &apos;s philosopian philosopher Joosti ( 36 ) , says , is going to be beautiful , powerful and unprecedented .
Risk to Joost : Cuba &apos;s classroom includes &apos; Travieta &apos; and &apos; Tosca &apos; , balletilaresponses from the magic &apos; Bolerost &apos; lovely &apos; Carlssonin &apos; , and neither is there a lack of ownership of the plan , this time by the wonderful orchestra of Joseph Haydni &apos; Aastatime , by the same international creative team that brought Pirilata Haydni even up a masterpiece of work &apos; in 2015 .
Birgitta Festival has much more than just concerts and theatrical answers .
It is greater than any musical theatre in its normal form .
It is a festival whose snow is taking hold and is never completely dissolved .
Because the experience the listeners receive in this superior and mysterious environment makes human souls more generous and touches on human models in a way that cannot be described .
At risk , you are the first year of the artistic leader of Birgitta Festival .
Did the Maestro Eri Kans not feel like a little big ?
Of course , but since I had a very personal relationship with Mr Klaus , it has helped a great deal .
She went to me all over my student career and also supported me at the beginning of a dirigisme career .
It is perhaps thanks to this that it will be easier for me to continue his work .
There has been so much prosperity injected into the Festival team of Birgitta Sestival in Klas and , of course , it will be passed on to me as well .
It was excellent to join the team , who knows exactly how things are going .
It was the great heart of Eri Klass that also gave me the strength to press ahead with Birgitta Festival in Tallinn &apos;s film harmony .
And here I am , and I can !
What could the audience do at this year &apos;s Festival , what are you offering in particular ?
We have a first ballet , written to Mrs Lindgren &apos;s story , from England , Latvia , Lithuania and surprisingly .
&apos;Karlsson shall fly &apos; .
And a criminal nightmare about it is that it is the author of a ballet in the Latvian composer , Juris Karlson , who himself expressed a wish to write it into .
Obviously , she has already lived the Carlsson box , who has been alive since her child .
At the risk , how can you stick to all this ?
It is certainly thanks to my supporting partner .
Such a job requires a support system and a lot of love , and I am fortunate to have a lot of love .
And I have noticed that my personal emotions do not depend on so many other people as I am , in other words , on how I go against every new day .
And such an awareness of tone , of maintaining a positive tone and , in fact , of smiling in a mirror in the morning , led my happiness to a great extent .
Especially now this week , when there are the most important tests , I have been particularly keen on it and it is working .
To laugh itself is an accentuation of the brain and an increase in tone .
It is not just a hollow word .
I think that people do not even know half of the things about their own body that the universe offers them , but let everyone find them little by little .
Now is an important moment .
Do you also have some ritual before taking the dirigend wedding ?
There are still clothing to be replaced with more comfortable ones .
This is a small moment for itself .
But , overall , yes , I do not have the opportunity to pump or make a small flash before there is a great deal .
In fact , I even like to engage actively with people , even before the dirigene is taken .
But come to Birgitta Festivalle , what can be discovered here is not a particularly large opera and balled friend !
Watch a video of mood with Mr Joostin !
New results of the age assessment tests for Swedish asylum seekers were published
The latest results of the test , which shows that more than 80 % of its constitution was judged to be older than 18 , but not all believe in the fine @-@ tuning of the results , were carried out by asylum seekers in Sweden .
The Swedish National Institute for forensic medicine ( &quot; Runtsmedicine inalverket &quot; ) launched the tests earlier this year .
The tests were set up to assess age more precisely during the asylum application process , after the Swedish Office for Migration ( Migration ) was criticised for failing to properly determine the age of a number of admittedly underage refugees .
To date , 6880 cases have been sent by Migration to the trial , and the CIS has published a total of 2481 tests between mid @-@ March and 31 July 2017 .
Eighty per cent ( 2002 ) was estimated at the age of 18 or over , and in 25 other cases , the Institute of Forensic medicine estimated that the test was &apos; perhaps 18 years old or older &apos; .
In 432 cases , it has been concluded that a person is &apos; perhaps younger than 18 &apos; .
The tests will be used only in cases where people &apos;s age is in question .
According to Johan GöFrancson , who is working in the institution of judicial medicine , the results are consistent compared to those of the past few months .
&apos;We do not see much difference from the statistics of the past few months , the figures are quite consistent , &apos; said The Local newspaper .
It does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have shed light on their age for a large number of cases to be judged older than 18 .
In May , the Institute issued the 581 test results and said , in 442 cases , &apos; there are indications that the person under investigation is 18 years old or older &apos; .
However , when newspaper Svensson Dagblaed examined the results of this 581 test , it became clear that in 243 cases the person had directly claimed that he would receive 18 this year .
This medical age assessment method , by carrying out smart rug photographs and by field classes MRT , has been criticised in some quarters , after which they are allowed to be analysed by dentists and radiologists .
One of the sceptics is Claude Marcus , the Karolinska Institute &apos;s endochrinologist , whose tasks include assessing people &apos;s biological maturity in order to find out whether they went through audiences sooner or later than normal .
&quot; I have had good reason to think about this and I do not think that the method of measurement that is currently in use should be used .
Setting the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
If we cannot say so firmly , we should not pretend that we can , &apos; he said to Forest ro in his magazine .
But Johan GöFrancson from the Institute of Forensic medicine defended the punctuality of the tests : &apos; Generally speaking , there is little risk of a child being left inaccurate .
The highest risk , that is to say , at around 10 % if a person is a little under 18 % . &quot;

Anna Maria Orel , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old last @-@ year wolf , gave the London Mil a nice pot of debate by getting a good 18 with 67.307 .
After that , MM &apos;s noorium was a female disposable and a joyful woman confirmed that she hopes to fight for medals in the future .
The competition worked well and I had good experience .
The first test ( 64.80 ) immediately took away my average result ; the second ( 62.80 ) risk too much ; and the third ( 67.37 ) was able to keep me clear &quot; said Orel after the competition .
I was looking for my emissions and I am very pleased that I found them .
Mrs Oreli MM &apos;s debate ended with a good 18th place .
Vihmasadu Orelit did not bother , because he is on strike through the LTTE stadium .
&apos;I am feared &apos; , he said a little mute .
The London Olympic stadium had almost a full @-@ house people ; after that , did he get people around or were able to turn themselves off ?
Mr Tajani has done so , but in a positive sense .
Everyone says it adds - that is how it is !
If you compete on your own , you can experience it .
He then reassured me that he is satisfied with the debate on MM , and he still has many good competitions ahead of him : &apos; I have come here with the 32nd , with the last result , I ended in 18th place .
This is a very good result .
I am a 20 @-@ year @-@ old man - that is the only thing that matters .
I take away a good experience and in some days I want to compete on behalf of medals .
Western Virgina Governor announced party change
The Western Virginia Democrat governor , Jim Justice , announced at a Thursday evening meeting with President Trup that he would change political parties .
&quot; Be that or not , the democrats walked away from me , &quot; said Governor Justice .
&apos;Today I say to you , having said a great deal of prayer and thought ... today , I am telling you , the Western virgins , that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor . &apos;
There were rejoications of joy at the meeting .
&quot; So I will be a Republican tomorrow , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; As a engineer , I would say to you that it is time to play a different game . &quot;
The Trump had previously promised a major announcement at the Western Virginia gathering .
Trump wins Western Virginias with 42 points and Justice did not support the Democrat candidate , Hillary Clinton .
Justice , which is the only billionaire in the state according to Forbesi , was elected in 2016 .
In Forbe , it has coal mines in five states and the coal business on its own .
It is worth around USD 1.59 billion .
At the same time , the Republican National Committee ( RNC ) issued an announcement on Thursday evening that &apos; the party change of Governor Justice is another blow to a democratic party that would prevent the country from improving again rather than working towards it &apos; .
&quot; Only 15 Governor Justice &apos;s announcement of the lowest number of states in his history is simply the most recent wake @-@ up call for a park that is from the bottom to the bottom and unable to find a positive and unifying message , &quot; said RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel &apos;s statement to CS Newsi .
It is perhaps no surprise that , where there are many people , there are also many injured .
Urmet , in her medical tent on the web , told the Academy , yesterday , that they had to allocate quite a lot of posters .
Cereals and marches are the main , the wrong and the light fall .
Of course , headlines , squares and shoes as well .
According to Urmeti , visitors come to the festival with false shoes , and that is how the problems come .
The media have also had to help visitors with a few major injuries - there have been some panic and there has also been one shower .
We have also been stunning when a person has shackled his hand or his finger .
We are going to make smaller nurses here , we are sending them more to hospitals .
Watch the video as to whether a painkiller will be asked to treat a boy from solemn media .
Coe congratulated the Russians on their honest apology for the Doping scandal
Sebastian Coe , the International Sebastian Air Force , said that he had &apos; an honest apology from Russia on Thursday for the Doping Canal &apos; , repeated that now is not the time for the country to reclaim sport .
At the eve of the lightweight World Cup , the Russian lightning force , Dmitry Shylithtin , said at IAAF Congress , that the competition ban imposed on her country was the right one , with a clear aim to combat doping .
He apologised &apos; all the athletes who have been squeezed away by the golden and silver medals in the competitions &apos; .
Despite his comments , the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban on state @-@ sponsored doping in the contest , which was introduced in November 2015 , after the WADA report found evidence of state @-@ sponsored doping in Russia .
&quot; I think today was a very honest response , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IAAF President Coe to journalists .
&quot; The whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian League itself acknowledged that they have had quite challenging times and that they would do everything they could to restructure the Union . &quot;
In addition , Coe said that he was delighted that Russia accepted the criteria for its own return .
&quot; I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is being made , but Congress supports the working group &apos;s proposal that this is not the right time to withdraw Russia , &quot; said Coe .
&quot; In the next few months , we must do our utmost to normalise the situation .
We have always been guided by the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from a system that has been broken , &quot; he added .
Eighteen Russian athletes meeting the strict criteria for IAAF will compete as neutral athletes at the World Cup in London on Friday .
The chair of the IAAF working group , Rune Andersson , said on Monday that Russia does not yet meet a number of sustainability criteria .
Following a briefing by the IAAF Council , he told journalists in London that doping control was still inadequate and that unelected trainers were still operating freely .
The electric car revolution is dramatically changing the demand for metals .
Who are the winners and the losers ?
Not only will the electric car revolution change everything from the fuel market to the infrastructure , it will also create new winners and losers in the metal market .
Although mining giants like Glencore can say that they will win from one place and lose out from another , the smaller mining firms will not help .
At present , Glencore coal and oil serve , but future demand for cocats , lithium , copper , aluminium and copper will increase in the age of electric cars .
This year governments in the United Kingdom , France and Norway have made contributions to the spread of electric cars , allowing the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be banned in the coming decades .
So Mr Volvo has already been aware that they are planning to abandon the internal combustion engine , and Tesla is putting a cheaper guest 3 electric cars on the market .
Bomberg New Energy Finance predicts that over two decades , electric cars will be sold more than oil @-@ fired cars .
&quot; For some metals this will change everything , &quot; said the Capital Economics raw materials analyst Simona Gambranini Bisberg .
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as cocaine and lithium , the demand for which has been growing for years .
Electric cars have about three times more answers than the conventional car , according to the Glencore .
More answers are needed at recharging stations , so Exane BNP Paris estimates that it will increase demand for copper by around 5 % by 2025 .
An increase in demand for electric vehicle batteries means an additional demand for lithium , coscot , grab and manganese .
The Glencore will generate revenues from the growing trend for electric cars from the copper price increase and from being the world &apos;s largest producer of coscopes , as envisaged by the Jeffcoordinate Group .
This broker company estimates that the other electric car race will be won by the FFriday report @-@ McMoRan and First Quanma Minerals .
The market is reacting to an already changing trend .
This year , 70 per cent of metallic fish have been burnt in London .
The rise in soil prices was 37 % .
The left has also gone up 14 % this year , mainly because of economic growth .
Glencore excise duty in London rose by 20 % , having exceeded the rival of the Rio Tinto Group , BHP Billiton and Anglo telecom .
Lead companies such as Recyclex and Campine are on the side of the losers and will have to adapt to the new era .
The main end @-@ use of the gas is the batteries supplying the starters of cars with a petrol and diesel engine .
Electric cars use lithium batteries .
&quot; This is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found for other purposes to overcome the fall in demand , &quot; Michael Widmer , President of the American Merrill Lynch metal market , said .
As yet , the effect of the open @-@ flow trend has not been noticeable in the form of price movements .
Plii has risen by 17 % this year , and this is the best metal in London , among the main industrial metals .
Investors will only see problems for the metal far from in the future .
&quot; I am not sure that lead is such a bad thing because cheap oil keeps conventional cars in competition , &quot; said Herwig Schmidt , the seller of Triland Metals .
If lead demand falls , it will be slow .
That may be the case in about ten years &apos; time .
In the meantime , stricter emission standards mean an increase in demand for hybrid cars , which depend heavily on developed lead @-@ based batteries to launch engines , will be assessed by an international lead @-@ based research organisation .
Kergmetals such as aluminium replace steel , as a lighter car can drive further with less electricity .
This can already be explained by an additional minimum of 1.6 million tonnes by 2013 @-@ 2016 .
This represents 2.7 % of the world &apos;s production of aluminium .
This trend is likely to worsen , Mr Widmer said .
Aluminium has risen by 13 % this year , as growing demand from car manufacturers has led to a market deficit .
Steel manufacturers will not .
Ak Sway holding works with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce miraculous car chains .
ArcelorMittal and Tata Europe are also trying to develop a lighter meltdown from steel in order to counter the lower minimum .
&apos;One @-@ strong steel should be the answer to this development &apos; , said Exane BNP Paris analysis by Sylvain Brunet .
There is some progress in Europe .
The end of the oil era can also bring suffering to the plate .
It took around half of it as catalysts for cars with a precious diesel engine , it reported metal refiner Johnson Matthey .
&quot; Many of the raw materials that are now highly demand , such as oil and poster , may not have great demand in the future , &quot; said Bernard Dahdah , the Natix raw materials analyst .
This does not mean that the raw materials as a whole are becoming less important , but their importance will change over 15 years .
The plan manufacturers believe in continued demand for diesel hybrid cars .
Marc Grynberg , the leader of Uncore , said that in 2025 more hybrid cars will continue to be sold as hybrid .
In the 10 @-@ year perspective of the plan manufacturers , Toyota Motors and Hyalusi Motos are developed on hydrogen @-@ based cars that depend on a platinum to produce hydrogen @-@ based electricity .
So far , however , this technology has not yet been commercially justified .
&quot; Dialogue seems to be a clear loser on the road to electric cars , &quot; said Exane BNP from Paris to Brunet .
German car manufacturers suffered a major setback in July , as the court in Stuttgart banned diesel in the home town of Mercedes @-@ Benz and Porsche .
How financial rules for football affect Neymari &apos;s transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the unbridled spending of European football clubs do not prevent the record transfer of the Neyra World Expo from a Spanish football club in the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
Any consequences for UEFA , the governing body that dominates the European game and is in a position to prevent crews from participating in a prestigious League of Ministers &apos; turf , await the Paris Paris Saint @-@ GerMain .
The financial rules for fair play ( FFFP ) introduced by UEFA in 2011 mean that the PSG will have to demonstrate at some point that the Neymar transition was financed without huge losses .
Barcelona was paid EUR 222 million ( USD 262 million ) just for buying out its treaty by the friend , and Neymari &apos;s salary will reach tens of millions of dollars a year .
There are some financial aspects of Neymari &apos;s transfer to the French club .
The PSG will no doubt be in a position to come up with such money to recruit Neymari and to put its stars on the map , given that the team will be funded by the family governing the Katar Energy bill .
Clubs are allowed to spend a great deal of money on recruiting players , but they have to balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to get out of the football business .
The FFFP was initiated by Michel Platini after his election as President of UEFA in 2007 .
This former French player believed that clubs in search of success are actually engaging in fraud and risking ruin if banks or owners were to give up subsidies .
From 2011 , rather than debt for FFP clubs , the focus will be on monitoring these losses .
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich used first in 2003 in Chelsea - to buy a club of potential and then to spend a great deal on improving the team and creating a global trade mark - is more difficult to implement .
During the current three @-@ year evaluation period for the FFFP , which runs until 2018 , clubs can bear losses of up to EUR 30 million .
And even though Platini was shamelessly excluded from the presidential office in 2015 , his successor to UEFA , Alexander Ceferin , remains committed to obstructing excessive spending .
&quot; The FP is certainly not dead and we will no doubt continue to strengthen these rules , &quot; said The associated Prinle Andrea Traverso last week , UEFA @-@ s FFFP &apos;s watchdog .
Although PSG pay for the Neymari overpurchase clause as a single full payout , they will be able to distribute this amount for accounting purposes for the entire duration of the agreement .
Neymar concluded a five @-@ year agreement , which makes it possible to demonstrate a transitional fee of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years .
On the first wave of FFFP sanctions in 2014 , PSG , together with Manchester Cityi from Abu Dhabi , suffered the most severe penalties .
A fine of EUR 60 million ( currently EUR 82 million ) was imposed on the PSG , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million , and a club was requested to limit the League of Meisters &apos; team to 21 players in the 2014 @-@ 2015 season instead of normal 25 .
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to cross @-@ select financial regulators by inflating their revenues through companies associated with the owners of the club .
Although a company of Qatar may sponsor PSG , if the value of sponsorship were considered to be above standard market rates , UEFA would not allow it to be taken into account as an official income .
This happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that Qatar Tourism Authority &apos;s value of PSG support was inflated .
It has been said that a certain section of the Neymari PSG service may come from payments via the 20 @-@ 22 World Cup Management Committee .
However , PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymari could become part of the World Cup and claim that UEFA &apos;s regulators could easily uncover such a manoeuvre .
The penalties previously imposed on the PSG mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant in any attempt to circumvent the rules .
People who were familiar with the situation will say on Thursday that UEFA has not discussed the transition proactively with PSG Neymari .
They talked to The associated Congress on condition that their anonymity is guaranteed , as they are not allowed to discuss the PSG situation .
The latest reports show that the PSG will make profits of more than € 10 million during the 2015 @-@ 2016 season at around € 542.4 million .
The latest financial year data have not yet been published .
PSG hopes that the arrival of Neyra will have a positive impact on sponsorship deals , commercialisation and brand sales .
The club is looking forward to an increase of at least 30 per cent in relation to the conclusion of the contract .
Spain too , clearly annoyed by the departure of one of the largest football stars , tried to prevent the Neymari transition by claiming that the PSG was in breach of FFP .
&apos;This is the clear case of &apos; financial doping &apos; with the club and state &apos; said to the Spanish newspaper , Javier Tebas , with President La Tebas , indicating that the PSG mainly belongs to Qatar .
The Arsenal rugger , Arconnect Wenger , whose club belongs to the American sporting magnate , shares with La li the attitude of state funding for the club .
&apos;This is a consequence of property rights and has changed the entire football landscape completely over the past 15 years &apos; said Wenger on Thursday .
&apos;When a club belongs to a state , everything is possible .
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play , since the country can have other ways or other interests to make such a big player represent the country . &quot;
The Norwegian low @-@ cost airline interoperability has a nice tradition of putting on aircraft aircraft the pictures of those who have moved borders in their own area and have been an inspiration to others , marp.ee writes .
Along with the expansion of its scope of operation , the circle of people who have earned their place on the aircrafts has also expanded .
The selected personalities include Benjamin Franklin , Greta Garbo and Miguel de Cervantes .
In the near future , however , a plane will be lectured by the Queen legendary singer Freddie Mercury .
Today , 50 years ago , an unrivalled storm in Estonia , ravaging houses and windows .
A century @-@ torn hurricane that raged on 6 and 7 August caused serious damage , particularly to the Baltic States , Hartland and Raplamas .
North @-@ west Estonia had more than 30 m / s for the wind during these days .
In my old metal in the garden , from one card tree to another , there was a plague with orders to support them .
All was blind and depressing , like a world lesson .
The mother has already flying from the house roofs , reminiscent in 2002 of the magazine magazine from the old Mrs Linda Kurova hospital in an interview with the Estonian foregone .
The husband of Linda saw the treasure he planted collapsed .
However , what sort of rubbish do you have in your hands , where are you going against such a storm ?
The sea came down as a window , containing water from windows &apos; , spoke on the streets of Haapsalus Kalda , Mrs Linda tona .
The fact that the roads were full of trees and the roof of the railway station had flown to 20 @-@ 30 metres was seen in Linda most of the weddings just as next morning .
According to the local saying , behind Paralepa , trees lagged behind the foam , some completely long , some boy .
Everyone saw a very depressing storm , a storm of beautiful old trees raped through like a war with pragmatism and pragmatism .
Western Viruony was not particularly hard hit by August 1967 compared to Western Estonia , but the losses were also huge there , the Official Journal of Viruony of 2007 .
The Milk Park and the Padise Park were swept from the Main , but our monk parks were also severely affected .
In Tallinn , winds were measured at a speed of up to 35 metres per second , in other words , approximately 130 km per hour .
In Tallinn , in Merilo , on the evening of 6 August , one of the tears of lead had shouted : &apos; Mother , mother !
The chickens are in the air and can no longer be signed ! &apos; , the Official Journal of ViruCountry has written .
The generation &apos;s term building in Viljanore was destroyed by the storm to such an extent that it was decided to be demolished at a later date .
The design of Tür &apos;s ski mountains did not stand up to the August storm , which was not later restored .
On 12 August 1967 , the newspaper Red Taet wrote that the urbanisation of towns and settlements from burned trees and their oxygen was progressing slowly , and that the population could get involved in cleaning work .
Fruit fields were also severely affected by the storm , and the newspaper stated that &apos; party @-@ to @-@ party organisations must be both an incentive and a guideline for fertility work and for fertile harvests &apos; .
They can be discussed in cases where average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m / s .
The net wind record in Estonia will remain in place from 2 November 1969 , when Ruhent measured the wind at a speed of 48 m / s .
The Vonly story on the island broke the sword , so the solid wind measured there could not be accurately recorded .
Secret of poor bathing areas : Night @-@ to @-@ night cleaning and poor coastal beauty
Cold summer bells also mean less duplication in the ski areas of Tallinn .
&apos;If it is not , people are on the beach and , if it is not , there are no people &apos; , it is the corner who says the floor .
In the Stroom beach of Northern Tallinn , cafes are being torn up .
They are offered by a tractor running at low turnaround turns of mechanical competition that is plundering the platinum .
In fact , the latter saves seven centimetres from depths through the sand , collecting marine litter and the risk that people have been left behind : Bottles , cigarettes and so on .
People still come to rank , regardless of whether the water is warm or not .
If the weather is beautiful , people are on the beach and , if it is not , there are no people &apos; , the management of the company Haaber will say Alexander r Usov , the head of the maintenance work on the floor .
At 6.30 o &apos;clock , there is a bitter clean @-@ up on the beach , because at 8 o &apos;clock the poster must be in order for the people .
The song is already at four o &apos;clock .
Apart from Stroom , he is still keeping an eye on Pirita , Lake Harvel , Kakup and Paleriaare Pikakari .
Landfills have been reduced .
Years ago , there were many more .
People now know how to assess what is being done for them &apos; , Usov , who has picked the shoes for 15 years , speaks .
It used to be the case that , when something new was put up , it was already broken next day .
Now what is on the beach is already being kept .
Price of a clean beach
One of the biggest jobs on the Estonian beaches is the clean @-@ up of marine rubbish , known as adolescent .
For example , on the surface of Pirita , it must be transported to 400 000 tonnes during the coastal season .
&apos;This is an unbelievable amount , &apos; notes Usov .
The second major category is municipal rubbish , or everything that people leave behind themselves .
At the one and a half kilometres on the Stroom coast , there are eight large waste titles that need to be emptied three times a week .
So much rubbish arises .
However , the cold summer bells have meant that the rubbish is one @-@ fifth less than otherwise .
The third species is deserted objects .
These are mostly cargo journeys .
This time , Usov has pulled out of the sand inside tens of rubbish .
They will wait for the owners to beset the timber route .
&apos;normally more comes out of them , but that is a normal harvest &apos; , which already knows that it will soon find them back in the sand .
Children come to beach and take toys to swamp them in the sand again .
Prüm is being torn up
Erika Scholler , the spokesperson for administrative services , admits that the tractor &apos;s screening work is disrupting local communities .
Noise , which runs from night to hours of steam , interferes with the adjacent population .
However , that work is impossible on a day @-@ to @-@ day basis .
In one month , it comes through the warfare twice .
&apos;If we do not , we will be fined by the city section &apos; , Mr Scholler will note .
However , like Pirita , Pikkar and Persian , the aim is to have Stroom rand included in the international Seoul quality mark .
&quot; There is much more work in Estonia to ensure that the beaches are cared for than Europe , &quot; says Scholler .
We have more adolescence and stone , and it is more difficult to drive in the sand .
However , we have less rubbish on our beaches than elsewhere in Europe .
Listening to the talk of rubbish on the beach , Martin beside Stroom is moving around unsolicited interlocutors of journalists and flateners , highlighting the current weaknesses on the floor .
Homo is a picture everywhere in the gallery .
The problem is the birds and net slaves who have got the rubbish bags on the fringes &apos; , Martin declares .
Although it is difficult to assume that people can change their behaviour to date , Martin hopes that the urban government will do something about the waste bin chains and impose on them , for example , the cameras , in order to prevent them , at least on the birds , from finding their way into the news .
In general , however , Mr Stroom &apos;s beach is satisfied with developments .
We can see that the city is taking care of this .
It has become more pleasant with children &apos;s squares , enlightened and fresh ascepted roads .
It used to be the case that only one road was able to be travelled on a case @-@ by @-@ case basis , &quot; says Martin .

Marine God is not generous enough .
&apos;I have been working on this for a year and have so far found nothing valuable &apos; , says Dmitry .
As a reservoir , the Dmitry Treasure Dmitry is a few euro coins , pumps and also a dangerous pound that will subsequently be thrown in the bin .
Normally , coins are still coins .

Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25 %
The Bank of England is expected to be informed that interest rates will be maintained as weak economic growth and the easing of inflation have dampened speculation on the rise .
Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain sluggish as households &apos; hard @-@ pressed incomes have put interest rates on hold .
Policy @-@ makers of the Bank &apos;s Monetary Policy Committee ( MPC ) voted for a 6 : 2 % retention , and fewer members will be demanding an increase this month , as slow economic growth has weakened support for the upturn .
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank cut its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on household incomes would persist , as inflation is still expected to rise to 3 % in the autumn .
At the same time , the Bank also signalled that the increase in rates will be necessary to contain inflation due to Brex over the next few years , and the financial markets may require an expected increase in lending costs .
Members also voted in favour of the partial withdrawal of the mammoth package , which was triggered a year ago by Brex .
In February , the Bank will terminate its fixed @-@ term financing scheme , which provides cheap funding to the banks , even though it said that it now expects an increase of GBP 15 billion under this scheme , which is GBP 115 billion .
In the minutes of the decision on the rate , the Bank says that &apos; gross domestic product ( GDP ) will remain powerless in the near future as the difficult situation of real household incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption &apos; .
In terms of rates , it was reiterated that , in order to reduce inflation , there was a need for &apos; some effort to be made by monetary policy &apos; and &apos; somewhat higher &apos; than expected on the markets .
Mr Börs is now forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second one in 2020 .
However , the Bank stressed that any jump is gradual and limited .
The Bank &apos;s reduced growth projections for this year and next year are comparable to 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
The projection of 1.8 % growth in 2018 remained unchanged .
After that news , the pound went down against the dollar and the euro .
Nael has fallen by 0.5 % to USD 1.31 and by 0.4 % to EUR 1.11 .
The decision not to make any changes is due to recent disappointing growth figures , which have dampened hopes of an upsurge in intellectual GDP in the second quarter , at 0.2 % in the previous three months , at 0.3 % .
The Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3 % in the third quarter , even though it will gather some momentum at the end of the year .
The Bank &apos;s most recent inflation report gave little reason to rejoice with rising inflation and abject wage increases to households by saying that the situation will get even worse before improving .
It was added that the monetary policy cannot prevent an income blow in the next few years , but a marked recovery in wages is expected towards the end of the three @-@ year forecast .
Due to the nail pound , the economy is also stimulated by the growing demand for British produce , which will partly compensate consumers for the lower costs .
The decision comes one year after the rates were taken last August at 0.25 % after the shocking EU referendum , which caused the pound to collapse .
The bank estimates that it is likely to take four years to breathe full life into prices and the economy .
Before the final decision of the Bank , growing demand for the rate had been felt as inflation had increased the pressure on hard @-@ pressed households ; in July , three policy @-@ makers called for an increase of 0.5 % .
Inflation fell by 2.6 % last month , compared to 2.9 % in June , although the bank said it was expected to rise again in the coming months .
The Bank said that excessive growth compared to the 2 % target was entirely due to the weak pound .
Mr Montlake , the head of the Coreco mortgage brokers , said : &apos; In view of the recent downturn in exchange rates , it seems that the mortgage market will become increasingly competitive again , as creditors will want to work and look forward to concluding the year positively .
Eurostars seems particularly favourable to those whose existing transactions are coming to an end , since refinancing , often without earmarking and at low rates , has become increasingly popular . &quot;
The NHS is writing 10 000 HIV drugs that cause conflict to people
Since September , patients have had access to &apos; transformative &apos; HIV @-@ preventive treatment , following a battle waged by the Supreme Court over whether the NHS should finance the medicine .
The NHS England reported that public health care is now estimated to make available to 10 000 people during the initial three @-@ year clinical trial - a tablet manned before the recess , which has shown about 86 % reduction in the risk of infection for high @-@ risk people .
The NHS has agreed to fund a clinical attempt after the Court of appeal supported last year &apos;s Supreme Court ruling that the NHS will be able to pay for PrEP , despite the institution &apos;s own claims that the medicine should be funded by local authorities .
The chief executive of the NHS England , Simon Stecrates , welcomed the launch unveiled on Thursday as &apos; new , far @-@ reaching intervention &apos; , while the National AIDS Fund ( NAT ) described it as a &apos; landmark moment &apos; .
Sexual health clinics in London , Bright ton , Manchester , Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to register people , and in October there will be more clinics before the programme is put in place everywhere in England by April 2018 .
The PrEP , which is the prophylactic of a Cinderella , is an act of HIV medication before the recess to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
Clinical trials show that the PrEP significantly reduces transmission of HIV to people at risk of infection .
The introduction of the PrEP before the recess means that there are enough medicines in the body of the human being that prevent HIV from being infected .
Such medicinal products can be taken every day , or at the latest two hours before the recess .
Successful candidates include lesbian or bisexual men , transgender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and cannot be treated .
Clinics are identified by suitable people willing to take part in clinical trial , including men , women , transgender people and those whose HIV @-@ related partner cannot receive antiretroviral treatment .
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there can also register their wish to participate in the local sexual health clinics participating in the programme .
The programme costs GBP 10 million and the NHS England signed the contract to obtain medicines this week following an international procurement procedure .
The purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the true potential of the PrEP by gathering clinical evidence of who the medicine is intended for and how it is consumed and implemented in a big picture .
Stecrates said : &apos; This new massive intervention should complement and intensify the wide @-@ ranging and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV .
This is yet another milestone in the more than three decades of fighting one of humanity &apos;s greatest health problems . &quot;
Deborah gold , CEO of NAT , said , &apos; This is a landmark moment in the fight against HIV .
The PrEP , if properly targeted at those who need it and are at risk , will offer an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England .
Since September , people with a high risk of HIV in England have had access , through this clinical trial funded by the NHS , to a powerful new tool that is individually manageable and does not depend on negotiations with a partner , thereby improving many lives .
We warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , the CEO of the Terrence Higgins Fund , said : &apos; Now it is a priority to ensure that the clinical trial is carried out quickly across the country and that none of the people at risk of HIV is left behind .
Now that the PrEP clinical trial has been obtained , we are on the way to protecting more than 10 000 people who are at risk of being infected with HIV .
The Minister for Public Health , Sharon Hodgson , said : &apos; The start of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and long overdue after months of delay and government tearing its feet .
Evidence shows how much change this medicine can make to HIV prevention and to stop the spread of this life @-@ changing infection .
This clinical test takes us one step closer to a full understanding of the PrEP &apos;s advantages .
Now it is important that the clinical trial is taken over as soon as possible to protect people who have contact with HIV and to bring us one step closer to halting the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
Electricity prices increased by 12 % in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
The difference in electricity prices between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania was reduced to € 1.94 next day , compared to € 7.71 in June this year .
The main cause of the price difference is the richness of the Lithuanian @-@ Swedish Community .
In Estonia , the average electricity stock exchange price last month was EUR 34.33 per megat hour and the price went up by 12 per cent compared to June .
In Latvia and Lithuania the price fell by five per cent to EUR 36.27 per megaphone hour .
In Finland , the price was EUR 34.17 and the system price of the electricity exchanges in the north was EUR 26.37 per megaphone hour .
Prices rose by 12 and seven per cent respectively .
Between Estonia and Finland , electricity moved 75 % of last month &apos;s hours to Estonia and 16 % of hours from Estonia to Finland .
The remaining nine per cent of hours between the two countries did not carry out the next day &apos;s transactions .
Estonia and Latvia circulated 99 % of the time from Estonia to Latvia and 73 % of the hours used the full transmission capacity .
On the Nasdaq OMX market , which took place on the last trading day in July , the price of the electricity stock exchange could be around EUR 34 and EUR 37 per hour in September .
Carbon prices affecting electricity production increased last month and transactions were between EUR 5.04 and EUR 5.47 per tonne .
High life - half @-@ decrees and clever designers have made it the home of the small Earls Court flat rate
Joanne Leigh , a former banker who is a passionate real estate innovator , changed his great home of Knightsbridge to the Earls Court flat in 2014 .
It is located on the first order of Queen Anne steel , and the fact that Joanne has not packed her bags and sold the flat is a tribute to the new design .
&quot; Before that , I lived on a much larger soil in Knightsbridge , a former partner of life . &quot; Said Joanne .
&quot; I looked for something that would be the equivalent of the price I offered .
I was told that Earls Court flat and had the same high warehouses .
I loved it and made an offer the same day . &quot;
Since its first visit , this 93 @-@ square metre flat has gone through a complete innovator .
To get a sleeping room and a complicated one @-@ stop @-@ shop : A kitchen walked through to get a sleep , Joanne wanted to include savings and half @-@ order to exploit high @-@ quality discoveries .
&quot; I wanted high @-@ level inventions , big windows , a lot of light .
Those were my demands , &apos; he said .
He asked Erfan Azadi Notting from the architectural and designer radio Duck &amp; D in order to take advantage of the 3.8 m desert and create a home , not just as an object of development but as a place where Joanne could live .
It was not high enough to add two areas to each other , so the architectural challenge was to create half @-@ order where you could stand .
Erfan has had to take a creative approach .
&quot; Construction is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; We have had to reorganise the premises so that they are on each other without having to bow down .
It was not just about building a platform , but about using steel construction to get it right at the height of both the upper and the lower space . &quot;
It has made it possible for Erfano to create two full @-@ ears in the room with a lot of dramatic elements on one side .
From an old age @-@ old light to the Retrouvius window , anthropocentric housing will be opened up .
The golden furniture , silver details and the retrospective Serge Mouille light highlight space style .
The use of mirrors plays a role in the inclusion of theatricality , space and lighting .
Mirrors have been added to both sides of the short corridor to appear longer .
In the night , with the mirror , I have the impression of a second window opening the door .
During their introduction , a mirror retention site will be available to all garments and glass requirements of Joanne .
The possibility of closing down vegetables if it is not used adds to housing , creating a more glamorous space .
According kitchens are nothing new .
However , what is unique in this kitchen is the fact that we are dealing with an uprising of a garage type .
&apos;That a bit of design work has gone into it &apos; explains the case of MDF , which has been spoiled with a steel strengthening .
&apos;This has a counterweight and therefore unites very simply to reject it &apos; .
Thanks to smart use of space and savings , Joanne now has 16 extra metres , an additional sleeping room and a better flax plan .
&quot; After all , a flotilla is what you sell - or what gives value to property - &apos; says Erfan &apos; .
&apos;The anchovy stunt takes an outdated form of tuppy and makes calculations on the basis of the underground area &apos; .
Here they have been able to increase the surgery , using high @-@ quality materials that add luxury to space .
&quot; The materials are what you are dealing with and thus help to bring about an emotional link with your homes , &quot; says Erfan .
&apos;You do not love electricity cable in the wall .
It is important , but does not call heart languages . &quot;
This shows that good design and increased area are helping to do something quite amazing about the common corps .
In fact , they may even give rise to a desire not to leave , as was the case with Joanne .
Chief figure , Sir Jensen , is a keystone running in Chicago &apos;s stunt , in competition with a colleague for professional resentment .
It does not read anything other than the amount of money that has been earned , without which any ethics is forgotten .
A man of her wife and her three children can only see her husband in a thief and late night .
In the first half of the film , I deem myself thinking that this is the &apos; House of Commons &apos; business world - even Kevin Spacks and Gerard Butler &apos;s spokesmaneer are similar .
However , the more film goes on , the less hardware element remains , and the moralising intention of film @-@ makers is becoming increasingly apparent .
A life @-@ changing experience will mean that the main figure will be cancer in the boy .
The choice now has to be made between work and family life .
The despicable poet makes the father think about the great buildings of Chicago in his walking visits about things that are really important , such as religion , well @-@ being , love ... , without touching even on the disaster of the twin towers .
After a third stomach where a son opens his eyes , there is a feeling that film @-@ makers are well on the basis of the aim of being able to lecture audiences , because even the most obsessive spectator is unable to hold back tears in the face of the suffering of a lovely cancer boy .
When the son falls into the bag and his situation looks almost hopeless , the father understands once and for all the morals of his work and makes the old man in search of charity .
Now I am taking a layer with myself : If a film has interoperability , I will reward my foresight after a film &apos;s coffee , if I am wrong , then at least one surprise can be commended on the sustainability of the casino .
For a moment , there is a suspicion that you will lose your seat - when your husband will call a sick person and the man will drift down the route of a corridor in slow motion .
The boy has , after all , been miraculously healthy , and even though his father has just lost his job , it will also prove to be positive , because now is the time to deal with the family .
I , too , feel comfortable - I can already predict the end of the American drama quite well !
In truth , the film is well designed ; all the elements are there .
You can take the button , you can laugh , the actors are a good and moral beauty : Money is not the most important thing in life .
I am surprised that the film is coming in well .
The new staff Commander intends to limit the President &apos;s media consumption .
Others have tried and failed .
Perhaps Mr Kelly will actually manage it .
He would then be the first one .
Politico writes that the new staff commander of the White House intends to limit President Trumpin &apos;s flow of information , including news , in the hope that it will keep the water in a more balanced manner .
Here is Joh Dawsey reporter :
&apos;When John F. Kelly met high officials on his first working day in the White House , he pointed out the key problem facing President Donald Trumpi in the White House , which he plans to resolve through the transfer of disinformation to the President .
Mr Kelly told officials that the information must go through him , whether on paper or in meetings , because the President would make better decisions if he was given good information . &quot;
Mr Kelly &apos;s diagnosis seems perfectly logical , but others have tried to do so and have failed to monitor Trup &apos;s media consumption .
President Trup &apos;s relationship with television reaches decades and , even now that he is in the White House , his television watching habits have gone nowhere .
&apos;If the candidate , Mr Trump , was annoyed to show him that he had been fairly reflected in the prestigious publications &apos; said the former campaigner , Sam Nunberg , in February to Politico .
Politico Füle wrote at the time that &apos; six former campaigners say that Trumpi Twitter driving is key to ensuring that his private media consumption includes a stable song of praise &apos; .
Very well .
But the idea that Trumpi Twitter used habits have ever been &apos; under control &apos; is ridiculous .
Perhaps those campaigners know something that the rest of us do not know about interoperability Trup &apos;s roofs would have been even more heartening without their interventions .
We will probably never get to know about the charges that Trump did not post .
When his helpless was able to save him even a few times the trouble , their efforts were worth it .
But no one has been able to prevent Trup from continually stirring up controversy .
Part of the problem is that in the White House , which is made up of competing clicks , people are trying , without exception , to promote their own interests by transferring material to Truh which supports their views on the world stage but may not always be credible .
In May , Politico , which reflects the whole story &apos;s course , the advisers &apos; leanings to the President of the feed , wrote strategically questionable information .
One of the examples described by the reporter Shane Goldmacher is :
&quot; Current and former Trumpers are saying that Trump can react to negative press pressures , particularly adverse effects on leaks , explosive by taking the obsession with identifying their source of origin .
This also happened at the end of February , when someone was happy to give the President his printed copy of an Internet provocator , Charles C. The Johnson website of GotNews.Net , a deputising depuder of staff , Katie Walshi , accused of being the &apos; source of several leaks &apos; of the White House .
It does not matter that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of mocking , or that he has not provided any concrete evidence , or has made false accusations and has withdrawn them in the past .
The Trump read the article and began to query Wales under the carpet . &quot;
Goldmacher added that Rob Porter , the then head of staff commander Reince Priebus and Head of the White House office , had tried to put in place a system to manage and document documents reaching Trumpin . &quot;
How did it work ?
Mr Kelly is trying to do exactly the same three months later .
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader , but Trump remains an impulse and his assistant will continue to compete in the name of influence .
These unchanging factors make the Kelly mission very difficult .
Street musicians coming from abroad will not get permission to speak .
In the centre of Tallinn , there is a great deal of aliens going on .
Those with whom the conspiracy had spoken acknowledged that it was playing in the old town without the permission of the city &apos;s administration .
The first were three street musicians who had taken the same number of dogs with them in close proximity to the Viru gates .
It was clear that musicians with rhythms and explosive clothes were in absentia migrants , who would have to spend one shower marching .
Despite the violence , the only woman in the company played a ruthless rhythm in acordion , while one man , next to her three balls , called him closer to the furniture .
A third man had stayed in one house alongside them and smoked a warmer self @-@ proclaimed agglomerations .
Their three chambers did not allow themselves to be disturbed by a passing people .
Mr Bob , who played on the Acordion with Noemi and the balls , said that he was wearing in the streets for both fun and money .
The purpose of the exercise was to collect the ticket price for a ship travelling to Finland the same day in the evening .
The question as to whether they were asking for permission in the old city for patronising was shaking Noemi and Bob &apos;s head .
Firstly , we did not know .
Secondly , we will never stand in one city for more than a day , a few , and most of them will be granted permits for a month or something like that .
There is no point paying for this , &apos; explained Bob .
When we got back to the Viru gates about 20 minutes later , we saw that two women are at musicians and are driving them to go .
This exhibition , with its bags and its docktails , picked up a test of happiness at the site of the Viru Centre .
There were also three Polish youngsters on the Viru street , one of whom was playing sign , the other was chlaring , and the third had even carried an electronic glass .
&quot; We &apos;re here to give people a feeling of entertainment to spread music and joy and to earn money for fuel and living , &quot; explained the trio of the pipe Mivosh .
According to Mivoshi , they are aware that the city authorities must be allowed to speak .
&apos;We do not have it of course &apos; , he said so joking .
But we hope that when people enjoy our music , there will be no problem at all .
Of course , when the police come , we go elsewhere but have to try &apos; , he added .
The Estonian Central Bank purchased EUR 149 million in bonds in July as part of a public asset buying programme of central banks in the euro area , while the central bank bonds portfolio increased to a total of EUR 4.36 billion .
The Central Bank does not publish more detailed information on purchases .
Hardo Hansson , President of the Bank of Estonia , has previously explained , in response to a request from members of the National Assembly , that the Eurosystem &apos;s plan for the assets of central banks consists of three different purchasing programmes : Covered bonds ( interoperability ) , asset @-@ backed bonds ( ABS ) and public bonds ( PSPP ) .
The Central Bank is buying up bonds from the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere .
These purchases will lead to lower @-@ risk asset productivity and will motivate investors to take increased risks .
As a general rule , each central bank buys its own government bonds in the framework of its public bond purchasing programme , while other government bonds are not purchased .
As the Estonian State has not issued bonds , the Estonian Central Bank is making so @-@ called substitution purchases within the amount allocated to them .
The central banks are also buying up in countries where the offer of debt corresponding to the purchase scheme is limited .
According to Mr Hansson , the Bank of Estonia generally buys European institution bonds , such as European Financial Stability Fund bonds and European Investment Bank bonds .
The Bank of Estonia will purchase bonds under its asset buying programme from March 2015 .
In the meantime , Elecirculate bonds were also obtained , but in June 2016 , the Estonian bank will no longer buy Elecircuit bonds .
On behalf of the central banks of the euro area , both the Central Bank of Finland will buy energy bonds from Elering and Estonia from June onwards .
Migrants ignore degrees and return to the &quot; millionset of millions of businesses . &quot;
Some of the wealthiest owners of the West Midlands have once again found themselves in a fierce confrontation with determined travellers , who have ignored the dump dumped by the county to win back away from their cotton .
Migrants have flown their 20 trailer fences on the streets of a prosperous &quot; millions of businesses &quot; crossed by the Someat ull .
They have returned with the army of horses , children and lorries after they were thrown out there only in May without being thrown away from the bureaucracy dumped to prevent their invasion by the Council .
The group found a weak position in the protective limits , turning its vehicles from an unblocked part left over by walking .
There are some clerical residents who have flew to the Someat Council saying that the Council is &apos; useless in dealing with the problem &apos; .
An anonymous resident said , &apos; They of Bentley Heathan , who stoned the furniture on Monday evening after being expelled , &apos; .
The Council must be embarrassed to take action because they are useless in dealing with the problem .
The migrants were there in May , they were forced to go and now they are back again .
More came yesterday evening , more probably today . &quot;
He added : &apos; Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such matters by obtaining long barriers to protect its parks .
I live on the street and I am not satisfied that I have to continue to pay the Governing Board if the Council cannot even prevent such a thing from happening . &quot;
A resident who also wanted to remain anonymous said : &apos; It is ridiculous ; we have just seen how the latter left these travellers , and a new onslaught is already under way .
This time the number has risen and the horse has even ruined in the grassland . &quot;
The representative of the Someat Council said , &apos; We are aware that the land near the street ethsbrook road is an unacceptable camp plate and we are working with the Someat ull police ; we are taking the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible .
The gathering of evidence will be very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by phone 101 .
This will help to create a picture of the situation for the Court when we present the case . &quot;
The Weekend festival will be visited by Minister for Culture , Indrek Saar , among others , who is pleased that it has been possible to bring real top names to Estonia .
The question as to why it is so important for Estonians on the Weekend festival is that it should be asked by all those who enjoy it in full for three days at the Festival .
What he says , however , is that real players have arrived in Persia .
&apos;When you look at the level of artists that has been brought to Estonia , the absolute top names of this musical junior are brought home - which often does not happen in our body &apos; , the Minister for Culture is speaking .
Which artists in the festival are speaking the most about Saart itself ?
I consider myself to be a relatively old and , for people like mine , one of the most experienced doctors , Armin van Bavaren , who stood up yesterday evening .
After all , at some point in time , all of us - and I quote - have got their feet on their own feet . &quot;
He does , however , highlight a number of other names , such as Chainsolidarity , Deadmau5 , Knifedin .
Of course , our own Estonian players too : Starting with NOMOP , they can be read in a whole series .
In reality , the concentration of names known as &apos; is very high &apos; , he says .

Up to 850 000 diesel vehicles are being upgraded by car manufacturers in the midst of criticism
The day before the Audi announcement , BMW said it would offer software coverage to over 350 000 vehicles .
The BMW Chairman said that the company believes that &apos; there are more intelligent alternatives than driving restrictions &apos; , referring to European cities , including the home city of BMW , Munich , which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that he will renew 3 million Mercedes &apos;s vehicles in Europe to reduce emissions from diesel engines .
They were not described by any company as a re @-@ summoning .
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions .
However , nitrogen oxide emitted from diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and can cause asthma .
At the same time , the cost of equipment intended to neutralise gas emissions from diesel vehicles will increase for the automotive industry , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
While German car manufacturers are under thorough investigation , Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s government is being accused of lecturing the powerful car manufacturers and of ignoring the signs of the problem .
Companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of the Volkswagen Agency , which has remained silent about the use of so @-@ called &apos; scam devices &apos; , which made it possible to adapt the exhaust gases to the regulations at the time of testing a car , but have returned to normal driving conditions .
Several heads of Volkswagen have been indicted in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic .
Last month , a former head of the Audi engine Development unit was arrested in Germany .
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may be prosecuted in the United States .
Earlier this year , Audi , in Germany , was drawn into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen , where the authorities accused the audit system of being installed in order to circumvent European emissions requirements , thereby extending the investigation , which had previously been focused on the United States .
The inclusion of the prize in the investigation may be a major blow to the Volkswagen Agency by a manufacturer of connected luxury cars generating a disproportionate share of the Volkswagen profits .
The Estonian schools are acquiring the European Union &apos;s flags at EUR 20 000 .
The Estonian Ministry of Education intends to purchase the flags of the European Union to mark the Presidency by 1 September .
In total , the EU flag of 570 educational institutions will be measured by 105x158 centimetres .
They are intended to be exhibiting in indoor spaces and must also be carried out in high @-@ quality printed material indoors with an attestation , an ERR news portal .
There is a text on the simple label : &apos; Confirmation of the Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union .
The estimated cost of 570 flags is EUR 20 000 at the Ministry of Education &apos;s price ; one flag costs EUR 35 .
Journalist murder highlights growing danger in Mexico
Week @-@ old Riodoce workers usually gather on Wednesday to review plans for the most recent chaos in the Blue State , sown by organised crime , corrupt officials and unceasing drugs wars .
But today , under the guise of a personal tragedy , they have gathered to discuss their own security .
They are being told that it is important to change their ruins .
Two senior writers discuss which seems safer : Either to bring children with them into an office that was the target of a grandiose attack in 2009 or to leave them at home .
Security experts have written three words to the &apos; enemies &apos; , &apos; neutral &apos; , &apos; allies &apos; .
They are asking reporters for every vector &apos;s names to provide live proof , they are sufficient impressions and inner feelings .
The presence of a government or a cartel is suspected of acting on behalf of drug traffickers , politicians , businesspeople and journalists , who make it dangerous for the chaos in Mexico to be reflected .
Violence is not a breath of breath , and the more deaths are accumulating across the country , the greater the proportion of which journalists make up , according to the Committee for the Protection of Solidarity journalists , since President Enrique Pena Lento was erected in December 2012 , at least 25 : 589 journalists have been killed since attacks and threats under national protection , and this year at least seven journalists in seven states have still died .
The latest fatalities include their editor and source of inspiration , co @-@ founder of Riodoce , Javier Valdez Carden .
&apos;The greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist &apos; wrote Valdez in one of its many books on drug violence .
His absence is deeply felt , even though his presence may be felt throughout the morning of the associate Riodoce Building , a big picture of a finger @-@ pointing Valdez with a letter of &apos; fairness &apos; and two of the 30s reports , Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez , carry T @-@ shirts with a face of his smill @-@ like spectacles , or their characteristic bankers .
Reporters discuss the common trauma , their nightmare , dreams , paranoia .
Although a separate Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists &apos; cases , only two cases have been brought before the Committee for the Protection of journalists .
Like most annual assassinations involving drug trafficking and organised crime , the number of which ranges to thousands , journalists &apos; killers are rarely brought to justice .
Riodoce &apos;s editorial activities will continue to reflect the violence in Sinalos , even though their hearts have been broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous .
Without murderers &apos; data and justice , Ibarra says that a meeting on security is of little use .
&apos;It is very stupid to waste your time at this meeting , &apos; he says .
&apos;as long as the cause is not known , you will trust everyone &apos; .
Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan , State capital , on the morning of 15 May .
He was able to travel only a few quarters before he was halted by two men by Red Toyota Corolla ; he was forced to leave the car and was shot 12 times , presumably because of the name of the newspaper , which translates as &apos; the twelfth river &apos; .
An armed man went out in the car of Valdez and made an accident in the vicinity of it .
Valdez was 50 years old .
She and two adult children were left behind .
The rumours circulate freely in Culiacan .
However , there is basically only silence on the Valdez issue .
Since the arrest of Guzman last year and the extradition in January of the United States of America , Blue authorisation has been one of the country &apos;s most bloody battlefields , as rivalries are fighting to fill a power vacuum .
It does not matter that , on the streets of the blue licence , a person or even several people are shot down every day , or that the cemeteries are ridden up from the doubly decorated double drug kings , which are greater than many homes living .
Let us forget for a moment that the time for peace indicates just one cartel running at sea with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States .
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers of its work , Ismail Bojorquez , co @-@ founder and chairman of Riodoce ( 60 ) , feels deeply innocent that he was unable to protect his friend .
He believes that the killing was facilitated by two mistakes .
The first was the publication in February of an interview with Mr Damaso Lopez , a cartel that is in competition with and is in war with the sons of Guzman .
This piece of correspondence may have been alluded to by the gangs who are suspicious , buying all the copies of the publication as soon as they got into the shelves of the newspaper .
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave his country in the name of his own security after the crackdown took place in another newspaper delivery that reflected the same story .
Valdez was a legend , both in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico .
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues had assumed that he would be there forever .
He worked as a veteranreporter at Noroes in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce , selling 50 @-@ dollar parts .
Bojorquez said that in Sinalo &apos; it was impossible to deal with the press without touching the drug problem &apos; .
The newspaper took a long time to know with its courageous and honest reports , and sales and advertising increased .
Reporters loved to express vigorous studies without any fear of censorship and readers in a fascinating publication from which they could read stories that no one else dared to report .
Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce , the newspaper won a prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for her Latin American reflections .
In the same year , the Committee for the Protection of journalists in Valdez ( AKK ) won the International Press Freedom Prize for its courage to follow the Mexican drug story wherever it leads .
He openly admitted that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to live on , &quot; he said when he received the AKK prize .
Last October , he told the television channel Rompeviento in an interview that drug trafficking was a way to live in Sinaloa .
&quot; To embrace the challenge that journalists &apos; office has to face now is to play fun .
I do not want to be asked what I did or why I did not say what was going on in the face of so many deaths . &quot;
The Riodoce collegiate long for a teacher of Valdez , a joke who , like a madness , a friend who kindly shared embryos and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
They supported his routine .
He was always wearing his barrel .
He moved from the office to El Guatemyabo bar and was always on the same song .
Now they are asking whether his routine love became fatal .
His death has also made them question how best to do his job and stay alive .
&quot; They do not like the rigidity of their women , their children , their legitimate businesses , with their secret landing plates used to transport drugs . &quot;
&apos;These things should not be touched , &apos; said Bojorquez .
The result will be strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ esteem even in the best times .
Trust in your instincts .
If it smears suspiciously , it doesn &apos;t .
According to the editor of Riodoce , Andres Villarrez , the problem is that &apos; the fragrance can be deceived ... and that is how it happened with the Jany . &apos;
He and others are saying that the old rules no longer apply in Malos , just as they do not apply in Tamaulipasis , Veracruz , Guerreros or other states that are home to the toxic composition of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt state officials .
The landscape is constantly changing .
In the space where Riodoce workers met for security training , mobile phones were suddenly no longer permitted ; a few days before that , it was revealed that only a button sold to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
Two policemen searched to the house under the guise of the tree relieving a 40 degree bullet .
They have been appointed by the Government to the post of office of Riodoce , situated in a four @-@ point building in the centre of the Culiacan neighbourhood .
Some reporters wondered half @-@ joking whether these police officers are among the 50 % police officers that the Governor himself has discredited .
Several months have elapsed since the reporters have travelled to mountainous areas where the control is de facto in the hands of drug gangs .
Mr Riodoce &apos;s publication this week covered three main axes .
One of them was the murder of former boxing legend , Julio Lamberar Chavez venna , in Sinaloa .
In addition , they had a revealing story of government money being spent on the town of governor &apos;s home town .
And people were kidnapped by one of the most expensive restaurant groups , from Culiacan to Culiacan , from a cabinet .
There was no official announcement of who was kidnapped or how this happened , so caution had to be exercised when it came to writing what all cities knew as a place for drug traffickers and public authorities .
The reporter learned from the public documents that the restaurant has been registered as a politician who belongs to the ruling institution , the Revolutionary Party ( IRP ) , which dominated all levels of policy for almost the whole last century .
More recently , several IRP governor has been accused of corruption in court cases on a large scale .
In Villarreal , the reporter asked him to write previous incidents in the same place , including how the son of Guzman , who is wearing the name of El Chapo , escaped a military record .
Only a few months earlier , readers would have been looking to Valdez &apos;s cocktail to obtain information on kidnappings from the best sources .
&apos;In the past we would have already known what happened , &apos; said Villarline , 46 years old , whose broker &apos;s body construction deserves a shouting name , El Flaco .
&quot; Now all channels of communication have broken down with our sources . &quot;
The Valdez office has become savings on labels and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists , and the editorial staff have become something they could never expect in the name of the press .
Reporter Miriam Ramirez picked a few eyes and moved to the local public Prosecutor &apos;s cabinet next morning for yet another journalist &apos;s sake .
In the western state of Michoacan , Mr Salvador Abad comes three days after the massacre in Valdez .
A dead body has been burnt and , according to the officials , it belongs on the basis of DNA tests .
Journalists across the country have become more vocal and highlight the words &apos; SOS press &apos; as an organised protest against thugs and buildings .
On that day President Bojorquez will be in Washington in an attempt to gather international support in the Valdez case to get justice right .
The day after the death of Valdez in meetings with the Governor of Smitry , the Ramirez authorities accused journalists of crying and killing them of telling the truth .
Since then , he asked that he be diverted from government activity by concern that he had an influence on his objectivity .
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were &apos; constrained &apos; by organised crime , complicit state officials and an indifferent society .
In his most recent book , &apos; Drugs press &apos; , he wrote that reporters not only kill drugs gangs , but also at the behest of politicians and security forces , who are in contact with organised crime .
The media monitoring group Articulo 19 awarded more than half of the attacks by journalists to the police and state officials last year .
&quot; In Mexico you connect because you want to keep quiet , &quot; said Ramirez .
Murder obviously has a bloody effect .
Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipasis six years ago .
His body was found together with a letter , probably signed by the cartel LOS Zetas : &apos; I am here for my reports &apos; .
She had a computer keystone and headphones alongside her deserted head .
Some outlets have decided to close their doors , for example in the northern border state of El Norte in Chihuahua , following the killing by March of their correspondence , Mrs Borgh .
Others are dragging on as they did in 2004 , following the murder of their President of El Manana de Nuevo Laredo .
In 2010 , the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke in public to the drug cartel with the headline &apos; What do you want ? &apos;
Some journalists have fled to their home states or even to their own country .
It is a nervous decision .
It is difficult to find a job in exile and they still have to hang onto the streets in order to avoid dangers .
And sometimes they are being hunted behind , as is probably the case with the photographic Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered in 2015 at a Mexico corridor with four women , three months after Veracruz had fled .
Those who remain in place and continue to work will have to dance around the risky decisions on a daily basis .
Ibarra , who once wanted to become a poet , admits that reporting drugs trafficking scares him .
&quot; Mexico is on its way to hell , and that is why I am going to report , &apos; she said .
In a recent midnight on Friday , when the latest number had already gone down , Riodoce editors stayed on a thorn in front of the office and looted a beer when it suddenly began to calibrate all phones .
In Mazatlanis , a rival city of rival gangs and security forces , 19 people were killed by confirmed data in the fire @-@ fighting between the rival gangs .
The war escalated , just as many of the messages left to them by the cartels found in the region also promised .
On the basis of the same hard line , the reporters picked up the news on the Riodoce website using a mobile phone .
The front of next day needed to be changed .
The ramifications humbled along the lines of a new exchange of fire in the region .
Bojorquez paved towards on @-@ call police officers to see whether they are vigilant .
If they feared it , they did not at least show it .
Under the massive tree of the descendant of the newspaper , where his average finger can be seen for the whole of his Shop , the Riodoce workers carried his footsteps in his footsteps .
&apos;How can one ever think of closing down &apos; said Bojorquez , &apos; when on the very day Javier killed , a trainee asked me to send him to the street to report ? &apos;
Dinsidurse used defence colours to prevent enemies
At first glance , it looks like a form , albeit rather frightening .
Scientists have now made public the first findings regarding the unbelievable prevalence of rallotry size discovered by the Canadian miner , which has survived so well that the experts have described it as &apos; a Lisat of the dindepartments Mona . &apos;
It has survived so well that it was even possible to establish that the skin covered by his soya was the colour of the bunch @-@ box Brown and his past had been somewhat &apos; complicated &apos; .
The present Biology report described the status quo as &apos; the best @-@ preserved piece of gender pressure ever found &apos; and when &apos; one of the best members of the world is best &apos; .
Fossil is a new type of nodosaic pressure that lived in the middle of the cricket era , 110 @-@ 112 million years ago .
The incredibly good maintenance of this was provided by theatres who describe it as &apos; truly remarkable &apos; .
This herbal food is the best preserved type of phosphorus that has ever been found , according to the National Geotransmission magazine .
It was found on 21 March 2011 when he extracted the Suncor Millenium mining in Fort McMurray near Northern Albertini in Canada .
He struck something that did not remember the thread around him and decided to look into it in greater detail .
The detected phosphorus was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum .
For the next six years , an animal has been working to extract 2 500 Nazi ( 1 100 kilometres ) from a piece of land .
After all the hard work , the end result is now finally ready to be made public .
&apos;If a bit of a bridge is torn up , one can hardly believe that he is sleep , &apos; said the leader , Caleb Brown , the scientist Royal Tyrrell museum , where the present is exponential .
&apos;Through will go down in scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved members of the dinosa , Mona Lisana . &apos;
In his investigation into leather , he found that this animal feed , although covered by soya and reminiscent of a walking tank , was likely to be significantly threatened by feed pressure .
This curfew socks used a red and white shelf to hide from predators and applied shelters technology , which is called shelter and is also used by many today &apos;s animals .
This has allowed , as experts have said , the dinosaur to be better integrated around and the enemies avoided , because he is likely to be hunted down by the major curve .
This 110 million @-@ year @-@ old family of nodomains first entered the news in May and is now visiting the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum .
The theatre has now studied being and given the name to it by the Borealopelta Marmithell Museum mark Mitchell , a famous team that took more than 7 000 hours to uncover the laborious revealing .
Thanks to the amazingly good preservation of the father , Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the socks on the body .
They found an aberration - a common method of protection in the country of animal origin , which means that the tip of the existence was a dark port as a lower one .
Although the shelter is rife , the findings come as a surprise , since Borealopelta is much larger than today live with overshadowed animals .
It suggests that the dinosaur meal was sufficiently actively hunted by other animal feed surgery that the evolution preferred to be overshadowed instead of opposing the survival tactic .
However , the majority of animals which use modern shelters - for example , fears , pig beans or scars - are much smaller and more vulnerable as a saga , which suggests that nosaic pressure had to make a real effort to survive .
&apos;A strong hunt on the gigantic grinding of the gigantic presence of soya beans shows just how dangerous predators may have been from the ghosts of the cricket era , &apos; Brown said .
The chemical analysis of organic compounds of Soomers also revealed that the spin of dinshare was a red box .
Scientists will continue to investigate this life , including the content of this warmongering style , in order to find out what the animal is going to eat in their last wave of war .
They believe that the dinosaur has plunged the river to death , thus ending up in a sea in which he has turned his back in front of the ocean bed .
At that time , Mr Albertini was as warm as he is today in southern Florence , and rivers and oceans are likely to extend far beyond the internal area as they are today .
&quot; This nodosaic pressure is truly significant as it is fully covered by soya @-@ like skin , while also remaining three dimensions , preserving the original shape of the animal , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; As a result , today &apos;s animal looks almost the same as in the cricket era .
Not very much imagination needs to be used to reconstruct it - it is enough simply to tear our eyes on our eyes and it seems as if he is sleeping . &apos;
The crisis era was the time when vast two legs of meat feed surgery - heterogeneous shops - were stunned on land .
Although King Tyrannosaurus rex of all of them survived millions of years later than Borealopelta , some of his formidable predecessors could have been hunted down by this breathtaking curtain .
These include Acrocanthol , 38 legs ( 11.5 metres ) in a long and six @-@ tonne monster .
Scientists whose recent findings are published in today &apos;s Biology magazine believe that Borealopelta was drowned into the sea after death , and this faciv mutualised .
On 21 March 2011 , Shawn Funk , when mining in the Millenium mine , Fort McMurray near Northern Albertini , discovered its validity in Canada .
According to the museum , it is the best preserved part of the world , including leather and soya , and it is a complete concentration up to insecticide .
These were on average 18 legs ( five meters ) long and canvassed at GBP 3 000 ( 1300 kg ) .
Two 20 customs terms invaded Pandora &apos;s length on its shoulders .
Scientists believe that this piece of flora and fauna covered by soya battery through the current Western Canada until it was flooded into the open sea of the river .
However , the undersea place of hoarding helped to preserve in an excellent detail its contents .
The remnants of this particular father &apos;s stone have survived so well that the titles of the mygarchies of soomers are still covered by skin remnants .
As Michael Greshko &apos;s magazine National Geointeroperability wrote : &apos; Such a survival rate is as rare as a lottery .
The more I look at it , the more unbelievable it seems .
The burned skin remains covered by mygarchical soomers based on the yellow of the animal .
A better frontal beside him and the five thieves have been pulled upwards .
I will be able to read the socks on his winter . &quot;
How did one activist find an answer to the question &apos; whose thanks ? &apos;
On 9 August 2014 , Brittany Ferrell received full shock .
Just one day after travelling to New York , it was father : StLouis &apos;s resident , through his rented room , on a phone line on Facebook .
He went on to the post of his former fellow countryman .
It reads : &apos; An 18 @-@ year @-@ old adolescent has just been killed by the police and is still on the street &apos; .
He was confused as to why nobody else had posted this information on his stream , which is why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
Pidega @ TheePhaah &apos;s user &apos;s postal services had been distributed on several occasions along his timeline .
In real time , Michael Brown , an unarmed 18 @-@ year @-@ old black young man , killed by a white policeman in Fergusoni Missouris , was able to report the death of a shining spark from the county of St.
He wrote a picture of the life of Brown , a body that leaked on the street , remaining there for four hours .
&apos;That is crazy , &apos; said Ferrell &apos;s brothers .
But death was nothing new for him or for his community .
He put his phone off , but later this evening he resaw the spark announced that people had gathered in Canfield Drive .
Photos of the police and the shellfish and the man who claimed to be Browni &apos;s father and kept the label &apos; the Ferguson police have just killed my unarmed son &apos; .
He looked in real time at the stream where the police officer stood before a group of protesters with a grave dog .
In another video , another policeman , he said , &apos; I kill you all ... animals &apos; .
Ferrell is reminiscent of the way he caught himself in the idea : &apos; It is unusual &apos; .
&apos;That is not the kind of murder to which we are accustomed and which we could describe as typical &apos; .
I felt frightened at that point .
I was angry and cooked &apos; .
He booked a return flight and travelled home the following day .
Having buried at 23 o &apos;clock , he went to his father for his six @-@ year @-@ old daughter and decided that they would be travelling to the twist Ferguson next morning .
What happened to Mr Ferrell and Mr Ferguson over the next three years will be the focus of a new documentary &apos; Whose street ? &apos; ( Whom do you thank ? ) , which will be presented in cinemas on 11 August .
This is about survival and protest , love and defeat , strength and firmness from the point of view of those people who live in this community and who , by demanding answers , took to the streets .
When Ferrell , along with a daughter - who had a flower broker on his doorstep and had a good knuckles on it - was travelling to Ferguson , they again talked about the experience and living conditions of the black men that they had repeatedly spoken about before this morning .
&apos;Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights ? &apos; It reminds itself of asking .
&apos;We are currently travelling to Ferguson because an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy was killed by the police , and that is not right &apos; .
&apos;I could not go along with him , &apos; said Ferrell later .
&apos;What is happening now is ... the culmination of the past .
It must know and see this and grow in the middle of it .
She must learn about the organisation and organisation of an activist , while also knowing the different layers of experience and living conditions for the Muslims , and what we have to do to be free and free .
Even if I succeed in bringing him up in such a way that he does not personally experience blatant racism , he is no different from some other black girls .
I feel I would be doing him a disservice if I protected him from this world . &quot;
The first suspension they made when they reached Ferguson was in South Florissanti , a place on the way from the police station , which had become a kind of camp site where the activists were waiting for news about the police officer , Darren Wilson , to be indicted in the end .
His daughter joined forces with local businesspeople who made southern skies there .
They put together food bags and helped to distribute them to protesters .
For Ferrell , a new type of activist has slowly begun to take shape .
&apos;My activist changed completely after 9 August &apos; , he said , noting that when he was a student at Missouri @-@ St. Louis University , he was the President of the Association of National students on cancer and focused on food justice and health inequalities within Muslim communities .
&quot; I did not have any organisation experience .
It all just laden . &apos;
Two weeks later , Mrs Folayani , a film co @-@ director , met during the Ferrell evening demonstration .
Mr Folayan said that he and the film operator Lucas Alvarado @-@ Farrar simply wanted to document what is going on .
In the face of Ferrell , the question arises : &apos; Are you going to try to document what is happening or to find a story that can be exploited ? &apos;
Such scepticism was the result of countless cases where people - often white - come into the community and try to capitalise on its firmness and firmness .
The Folayan explained in a recent interview : &apos; We have heard that the voice of people born in Ferguson and growing up in Ferguson will not be heard and we wanted to do so otherwise &apos; .
Folayan had already raised its hands with Damon Davis , the regional artist known for an activist in connection with prisoners sentenced to death .
His involvement made the project attractive for Ferrell and another six , who were watched for years by the Whose street ? &apos; Team following the shooting of Brown .
&apos;In this documentary , no one speaks for us , no one speaks for us , no one speaks to us , but for us , &apos; said Davis .
&apos;It was important to me how these people were depicted , as that is how I am depicted &apos; .
Although the aim was not to focus on the experience of Ferrell - it was intended to show that the movement was not &apos; the head of salvation but the community coming together &apos; , as Mr Folayan said - he made the film the most open .
As a result , the &apos; Whose street ? &apos; Document surprisingly personal aspects of the life of Ferrell , such as mercy and marriage with his wife .
&apos;I felt as if I was naked , &apos; said Ferrell , smiling over the first time that he had seen a piece of urban work .
&quot; But I understood that there had to be a certain degree of vulnerability to do this work and to humanise the black people . &quot;
What is more , the Ferrell story underlines and puts the role of the black homosexual woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement at the centre again .
Two of the three initiators of the movement who thought in the social media after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 are homosexual : # BlackLivesMatter .
&quot; In leading roles , black homosexual women have generally maintained the movement , &quot; said Ferrell , &quot; precisely because we have to fight on several fronts all the time .
Roma homosexual women must bear the full burden . &quot;
The Folayan agreed , stating that &apos; the movement is indeed kept alive by black women and many of them are black , homosexual women &apos; .
At the same time , he says that &apos; this is not a kind of matter of creating equal opportunities &apos; - Ferrell was not the focus of the film chosen for his identity .
&apos;He was a man from whom the right energy was leaned &apos; he said .
&quot; But it is no coincidence that she was directly in the frontline because there is much at stake as a black homosexual woman living in such hubs .
His energy can be perceived on the screen . &quot;
At the same time , the news cameras Ferguson have long disappeared , but racial links between the community and the police are still fragile .
The conditional sentences imposed on Mr Ferrell at the time of the demonstration for blocking the motorway will last for another 2.5 years .
He describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere in the region he calls home as simply a &apos; huge free threat &apos; .
Nevertheless , it still attaches great importance to the mantra it has eaten since it first took to the streets of Ferguson a full three years ago .
&quot; It is our duty to fight for our freedom .
It is our duty to win .
We must love and support one another .
We have nothing to lose except our chains . &quot;
7 examples of how to overcome from the Weekent pipe poppy
Some of the more stubborn meters will find help after their meagre graves .
Or by the saying &apos; avoid a pomelle , break a pyramid &apos; .
But this is just the inevitable postponement and a proper blessing for health .
What can you do , after today &apos;s and tomorrow &apos;s Weekend trend - or other curve - to feel better this morning and to get the boy out of it as painlessly as possible ?
Joo Water .
Alcohol came down and down , after a great deal of pipe in the morning ... or , if possible , not even alcohol .
As the body loses a lot of liquids when it consumes alcohol , it must somehow be recouped .
Together with water , minerals are also stunned out of the body , and the compound is a good hair &apos;s mineral water .
Since the machine is often irritated after drunk , it is particularly good that it is soil @-@ free , or only lightly packed .
Go and walk .
It would certainly not cost to go to the grandmother to bury trees - that might be a fatal wrong decision .
But an easy process will help the body once again to remember what it is like to be alive .
Shuffling and beating out a boy is a more time @-@ consuming way of getting healthy .
Give the body energy back slowly and cautiously .
If you are already on track from yesterday &apos;s overrun , it will certainly not be worth trying to pay a heavy fat .
To begin with , for example , with the new volume in which the treasure treasure bodies are quietly placed .
If health around the South is already suffering , one could try the wedding , for example .
And a little later , a little bit later .
No coffee was issued .
This dium will free its body from the last water .
As has already been said , water and volume have your friends .
Contribute to painkillers .
If you take a painkiller this evening in order to prevent poisoning , then you have to deal with not only alcohol but also paratsedium or ibuprophet , and thus lose performance .
So the rivals will pay even more , and in the future the boys will be even worse .
What is more , the pain will not remain in the bodies anyway for so long .
If you take a painkiller in the morning , then you are doing it with an empty thread - it annoys you about the already ravaged machine .
Or , if the partner is not taken with it , it can get through itself well .
It is something like walking , but there is no room for complacency in walking .
However , far too active a speed and exorbitant posture was avoided - the physical effort should be moderate at the time of the boy .
A joke .
There is a silver talk , easy fun and nail @-@ friendly talk with the friends of time and with others ( suffering ) .
A Nazis and a woman may not be hijacked , but they certainly make it easier to tolerate after the phenomenon .
Once again , the pocket is going through anyway !
Worker at the University of Northwester and Oxford will be sought as suspects of murder
According to the police , an employee at the University of Northwestern and the University of Oxford is being searched nationwide , who has become suspects following deadly March wounds to find the bodies of the male people in a luxury basket in Chicago .
According to the Cook County judicial documents , an arrest warrant was issued on Monday without any bail @-@ out for the arrest of a 42 @-@ year @-@ old Wyndham Lathemi and a 56 @-@ year @-@ old Andrew Warreni , accused of their alleged involvement in first instance , Trenton H. James Cornell @-@ Duranleu .
According to the documents , a 26 @-@ year @-@ old Cornell @-@ Duranéu died after repeated marriages .
According to the warning issued to the community by the police station in Chicago , the body was found to be dead on 27 July .
The police received a telephone call call and found a victim on arrival in the Grand Plaza Corterhouse whose body had several storms open .
The officials said that Cornell @-@ Duranleu was recognised to be dead and the investigators regarded the murder as murder , while the police actively seek two suspects .
Ms Lathem has worked as co @-@ professors of microbiology and immunology at the Northwester University since 2007 .
Cubbage , Vice @-@ President of the University of Public Relations , said in a statement sent as e @-@ mail that Lathem has now been temporarily removed from work and banned from entering the cities of the University of Northwester .
&quot; This is now a criminal act under investigation by the competent authorities , and the Northwester University is working with the investigators , &quot; said Cubbage .
Wretn is a senior assistant at the University of Oxford .
In a statement sent as an email to the University and Somerville College , he said , &apos; We have been in contact with the British police and ready to help the US investigation authorities in every possible way &apos; .
In addition , the statement stated that my colleagues at Warreni were shocked and willing to present themselves .
Anthony Guglielm , head of the communication department in Chicago &apos;s police department , is urging the authorities to be handed over by suspects .
&quot; The police have an idea of where they are , but we are working increasingly intensively to define the exact location , &quot; said Guglielm .
Guglielm says that the local , regional and national authorities are helping to search for suspects .
Guglielm said that the police got a telephone call from the Grand Plaza Corterhouse administrator , who had just received chryptic rain that something had happened in Corps No 1008 .
According to the police descriptions , this was a vivid view .
According to Guglielm , it is not clear whether the event itself took place on 27 July .
He said that the security cameras confirmed the presence of Lathemi and Warreni in the building .
&quot; We believe that Professor Lathamal and the victim had a relationship , &quot; added Guglielm .
The Grand Plaza leadership sent out a letter to the population : &apos; The police are currently working to find out about the orchronology of events and the background to the victim , and are exploring different motives , including the possibility of a family dispute &apos; .
Firms that help your company avoid becoming the next Ubby
Amy Errett wanted to measure workers &apos; satisfaction in his e @-@ commerce start @-@ ups , but the polls were futile .
The answers were often vague , useless or , worse , misleading .
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity , some workers did not trust this process .
&apos;The system was simply not consistent and objective , &apos; said Errett , who runs an e @-@ commerce company , Madison Reed , which sells hair @-@ care products in San Franciscos with 75 employees .
He therefore called for assistance from outside .
Start @-@ ups dealing with new types of human resources are emerging , helping companies to find out what their workers feel .
By developing and licensing software aimed at measuring the involvement of workers , they will enable companies to make app surveys , target specific teams and demographic groups , provide anonymity and a hot line of submission of complaints to workers , and in some cases allow them to bypass C @-@ level managers and address the Governing Board directly .
&quot; There are now tools such as Strava and Fitbi for health monitoring , but where is Fitbi for your company ? &quot; Said Jim Barnett , co @-@ founder and CEO Reding City start @-@ ups Glint , whose software analytical tool is used by companies to measure worker involvement .
According to an Erretti , in the three years he has used Glint , he has got a much better picture of what his staff think and feel .
In addition to opinion polls aimed at intrusive studies and certain teams , it provides a company &apos;s heat card , which gives an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest support , enabling them to identify the causes .
Companies have started to realise that they need to stay informed about their working culture so as not to become the next Ub , which has been revolted in scandals since the former employee published a blog mail describing a harassing environment in which those who dared to speak were punished .
For start @-@ ups like Glint , the desire to have an overview is a lucrative business opportunity .
The global area of governance , regulation and compliance may be worth more than USD 1187 billion by 2020 , according to the results of the FTT Statistics website Let &apos;s talk @-@ about bookings .
This year , against the background of the dubious reputation of Uber , a start @-@ up company operating in Colorado , which helps businesses to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour , observed an increase in interest and activity .
It has almost 600 customers , including Airbus , Microsoft and Tesla .
Uber recently registered himself as a client .
Like Glinki , the convergence cent allows companies to send customised bookings , collect real @-@ time confidential responses and look at problem areas of heat cards .
It also offers an anonymous model of message that enables workers to report inappropriate behaviour .
And when it comes to the CEO , complaints go to the Bureau directly .
&apos;Public opinion has been delivered by the regulatory authorities , &apos; said Customs centi &apos;s founder and CEO , Patrick Quinlan .
I will say that if a company finds that it mistreated its workers or behaves unethically , it could face serious consequences , such as consumer boycotts , the withdrawal of workers and court cases , even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene .
Ruby interoperability , a restaurant with more than 25,000 employees at 500 sites , has been using the convergence census for more than a year to ensure that workers are aware of the rules and procedures and provide an easy way to communicate with the corporation headquarters .
If an employee wanted to report a problem earlier , he had to find a telephone number or email address at the corporation headquarters , make an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously .
This was often a daunting and uncomfortable process , said Ruby Technical General Adviser James Vitrano , who said that there was no good way to monitor workers &apos; complaints .
However , now that the company uses convergence centi , problems such as discrimination , harassment or unfair pay practices , which did not previously lead to managers operating in offices located in other cities or states , can be identified and dealt with more quickly .
&quot; I can get closer to the holistic 360 degree experience of the workers , &quot; said Vitrano , who chairs the Ruby telecommunications risk management group .
&quot; And we will protect our shareholders from legal disputes with workers . &quot;
The Quinlan said that companies started to take ethical behaviour , values and workers &apos; involvement much more seriously in 2002 , after an auditor , Arthur Andersson , collapsed due to ethical irregularities in the Enron scandal .
However , only when &apos; social media became mature &apos; did companies realise that they could not prevent their black washing from being copied online in public .
&quot; Before using the technology to monitor ethical behaviour , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
Both the Great and the convergence cent offer their software as a service , charging companies periodically for using their products .
It is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors , who have supported both start @-@ ups .
The convergence was funded in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Customs Capital , thereby increasing the capital collected to USD 47 million .
In November , the Glinti invested USD 10 million in Bessemer Venture partners , increasing its total funding to USD 60 million .
Such investments will come as no surprise given the interconnectedness of businesses , culture and venture capital .
More and more research shows that today &apos;s workers expect more from the workplace than they have done in the past .
In competitive markets , such as Silicon Valley , high wages and interesting projects are merely contributions on the table .
The workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they are devoting their time to a company with a positive mission .
&apos;When people are happy at the company , they feel they are listened to and more satisfied with the work they are doing , &apos; said Nina McQueen , Vice @-@ President of the Department for General benefit and Workers &apos; Survey , LinkedInis , which uses not only convergence centi but also Glinti .
Investors earn money if the companies in their portfolio are doing well ; companies are doing well when workers are committed and involved .
If the third party &apos;s analytical tools allow for an increase in the commitment and involvement of workers , it is no wonder that they will receive support .
Having data on worker involvement is important , according to professionals .
However , this data will be useless if it is not followed up by company supervisors .
In fact , when a company asks for feedback from its employees , it may raise expectations that change is under way .
And if changes are not made quickly enough or not at all , they can cause disappointment and reduce workers &apos; involvement .
&apos;When you ask for 4 000 proposals , you have to be prepared for 4 000 conversations , &apos; said the President of the Consultative and Business Administration , Kotter International , Russell Raath , who has seen companies go wrong by relying too much on data collection .
&apos;If things are not brought to an end , the workers will think : &apos; Did you actually listen to me ?
Do you care ?
And if you do not care , why should I care ? &apos;
According to the Erretti , the Madison Rhine , which now organises six studies among workers , has been able to take action on the same day that the problem has been reported through Glint .
And , having received feedback from workers disappointed with the speed and the quality of the decision @-@ making process , he was able to reorganise a number of crews in the company and offer communication training to deal with the problems .
However , Ruby interoperability will collect new data on workers and it is hoped that , in the long term , this will result in a longer @-@ term commitment from the industry , known for its high turnover .
&apos;If you are not committed to transparency , you will lose people &apos; said Vitrano .
&apos;If you lose people , you lose customers .
And if you lose your customers , you lose companies &apos; .
Baltic Star for the euro area : Fast @-@ growing incomes
Although the 2008 crisis and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic , the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching Western European rich countries &apos; incomes , with reference to the European Central Bank &apos;s report , Bomberg writes .
The Central Bank says that since 1999 , total economic output per capita in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations .
Low indebtedness , fast @-@ improving institutions and business @-@ friendly and non @-@ market @-@ friendly policies are the key to success .
&quot; The Baltic States , together with Slovakia , are among the few countries in the euro area , where reactor @-@ GDP per capita purchasing power has significantly converged towards the EU average . &quot;
Although the objective is for the total economic output per capita to be equalised to a richer Western Europe , in 2015 the total output of the Baltic economies per capita amounted to only 2 / 3 of the national average of the 15 countries that were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round .
Low wages have led the Baltics to seek better wages from abroad .
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic countries in a positive light and the economy grows this year , the local people are not enthusiastic at all .
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey , only a quarter of people in Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies were doing very well or rather well .
In the Czech Republic and Poland a little less than half of those surveyed thought this about their national economies .
NCAA &apos;s decision to cancel trends twice a day makes Bruinsi long
It is almost 23 o &apos;clock that football lovers in the mafier UCLA are stopped for discussion on the fringes of a new outlet in the university town of a team .
Some of them have burdened their businesses with the first day of their training camp &apos;s efforts to uncover their plight .
For a large part of the team , these Christmas minutes offer a break from midday to midday .
The players taking part in the course of the course will return , after a three @-@ hour trend , to the learning of cohabitation for final examinations before returning for next morning &apos;s 6.30 meetings at the WSSman football escort .
&apos;The next three days will be a real challenge for them , &apos; said the Bruinsi trainer , Jim Mora , shortly before Monday became Tuesday .
The NCAA decision to cancel trends twice a day to reduce the burden of players has , in fact , overstretched their days - at least until we get to one side with final examinations on Friday .
For this reason , the first three training sessions of the UCLA were timed to start at 19.15 in order to fit into the already dense schedule of the players .
The transition from two to more days on a daily basis means more days on a trong : The start of the Bruinsi training camp has been increased almost a week ahead compared to the previous season and , for the first time , during the six Westward season , training sessions are taking place during summer courses .
They are planning until 20 August to 18 trends before formal preparations begin for the opening game in September against Texas A &amp; M .
According to Mora , he is in favour of a change of the NCAA rules , although it adds another item to the players &apos; tight schedules .
&apos;These have an enormous burden on three or four days and that is a serious challenge , &apos; Mora said .
&quot; And they are going through this challenge ; they are struggling , they are wonderful young people .
I believe that when it comes to Saturday and we have more time , it will be a real pleasure . &quot;
Once the camp is over , UCLA training will be closed down , which is no easy task , however , given the clear view of their remote parking poster and remote from the centre of Luskini , a high @-@ class hotel that has already emerged from the gate mail protection network with footballs .
Since this weekend , hotels are occupied by players in Bruinsi , but Mora acknowledged that problems could arise during the season with free tobacco .
&apos;Strengthening security measures &apos; said Mora .
&quot; This is a real cause for concern and it is hardly exaggerated to think that people can rent a mouse and filter from there .
If you have a record of a training , you can do quite a good deal .
But we have a security team there and at the 8th parking station .
We will do our best to use what we have .
I will try not to worry very much about this .
We have a plan in place . &quot;
An Election Union of Saduare @-@ Ivanova , born of the Central Party , an Election Union for Republican Natiina Orange , removed from the Reform Party and forced to leave the ECB for Maria Kaljds , to show at least as much as political parties involved in the local elections this year in TeTallinn , an electoral association of creative businessmen , seems to be in party politics .
However , horses will be counted in the autumn , and the key question will be whether they will have sufficiently disappointed voters .
Who will remain in Sastaarea ?
How small the support department of Edgar Sastaare has shrunk , one might expect events orchestrated to honour his electoral union .
One member of the National Assembly , some former and present @-@ day affiliations and many unknown faces : Will this be the composition of the electoral Union ?
And why , in Tallinn , some faithful sympathisers and sisters avoid standing as candidates , can one ask that the &apos; Sastaare list &apos; of originators , led by corruption and suspected of corruption , is becoming a reality ?
For a Russian @-@ speaking poem involving the parent of the city of Lasnap , which was boosted by the municipality , and for all purposes a primitive computer game in which Prime Minister Jüri Ratas , while travelling on a rug , must the central party avoid the voices of 16 and 17 @-@ year @-@ old voters who are admitted to the ballot boxes for the first time ?
We look forward to other parties &apos; perception of the youth campaign .
There are two options to accept that only ETV , ETV2 , ETV + , Tallinn &apos;s TV and English @-@ language France24 channels will henceforth be viewed as opposed to entertainment from the beginning of August : To accept that , in future , only 10 telecommunication operators will see the wheel2 , ETV2 , ETV + , Tallinn &apos;s TV and English @-@ language France24 channels or will be surrendered every month .
There are probably also those who initially openly rejoice in the non @-@ advertised television experience , but in the end - albeit reluctantly - pay for television broadcasts and advertisements .
Deafening music , laden nation and rubbish left on the streets are some unpleasant side of every major musical affair .
However , if one does not want to be part of the honey itself , it is worth going home to discover a homeland instead of painting its head , and leaving the sleeping room for the Coptic sum of the festivals .
Washington changes rules on Green Card
Media publishers quote President Donald Trumpi , who said that a new US immigration plan will change the rules of the Green Card .
The plan foresees a reduction in the number of legal immigrants for 50 000 people per year , stricter rules on obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visas .
The new rules have been proposed by the Republican and supported by the President .
The draft law will be discussed in two chambers of Congress .
&quot; This law reduces poverty , increases wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers &apos; money by changing the way the US handles green cards to citizens of other countries .
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme .
The new application process will give priority to candidates who speak English and have the funds to support themselves and the skills to benefit our economy , &quot; said Trump , the US media outlets .
The young people of Siberian seto move to the city , to pensioners , back to the land .
Juevseyev is continuing the tradition of famous seto gold miners along the Maana River in the past .
She works 140 kilometres away from her home in Maana &apos;s additional war at Kuvai in a gold @-@ on @-@ board car driver .
It is a tough job : Two months of work for 12 hours without rest days , and then only 10 days at home and again at home .
In the three @-@ year period in which the Artel worked , Anatoly has only once seen its gold .
&apos;That is a thorny regime there : When you go in , you are thoroughly checked to ensure that you do not lead , and when you make it clear that it does not lead to gold , Anatoly speaks . &apos;
Mare Piho is speaking to Haida in the village of Haida , a local seto Jaan , who has spoken to him a great deal about the memories of his family in Siberia .
The remaining archaic culture of Siberian compounds will also have an impact on the home @-@ meters , as it is simply so dramatic that it will think most deeply about the distant cooks investigated by Piho Mare .
His first trip to Siberia will be 30 years later this year .
During that time , he has been there fourteen times and lived there for one year .
How much went to Siberia at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century to get land here ?
This is an unresolved issue .
I would argue that 8 000 .
I took this out of the story of the men in Siberian seto , who have thought about it themselves .
It is very difficult to say , because up to 30 people could come to one group at the time , but only a man was given a passport .
The passport was given to only one , but it was children , sisters and other female .
Look at how large that territory was here !
It was several times greater than historical Setko .
After all , it needed to be nurtured , managed in some way .
Setry came here as peasants , but their lives changed , because here they got into areas not only linked to agriculture , but also to the river ( pale @-@ parking ) , gold mines , industry .
For example , in New Petseris , many seals later went to work in a classified city of Krasnosesk @-@ 45 ( where the Soviet authorities built a uranium @-@ enrichment plant - J. P. ) when it was formed .
Did the mixtures then represent the majority of the population in this region ?
Yes , they used to live in a Compact .
In addition , the tradition of married with one another and of multiculturalism maintained for a long time .
Seven to eight children in the family were commonplace .
How different does Siberian seroom culture differ from that of the mother country ?
They are different , even though what was brought here was once the same .
They brought a great many ideas of peace .
They also made their own distinctions ( ideas of the people ) at the time , but they always made a distinction between what had happened and what had been done here .
Climate change has seriously influenced the traditional clothes of seals , because it is colder here .
The proposed changes were made .
For example , Setomaal had a salt plate , but it was simply frozen here .
Where are the Siberian compound villages and what life will live there ? / graphics : Alari Paluends ?
The link with the mother country was spiritually strong , it was considered very important .
It seems to me that this country will now be giving back there ; it will influence them .
Those girls who have lived in families have listened to amazing stories .
Piho has in mind people from the Estonian seroom delegation who came to Haida Bay Day at the beginning of July and lived in homes for four days - J. P .
What is still here is staggering .
&apos;It is extremely easy to come and get off the roof , because the city has a wonderful location : A railway beer and a road crossing point &apos; , says Taps &apos;s operisolist from Reigo Tampere .
The city is no longer just a military capital ; we have a great deal of nature , sport and culture , and the carrot gets everywhere .
Tapa is a tip @-@ pop city !
There are a small island in which you are going through the white river through the city to keep the therapeutic shells .
&apos;This beautiful place on the train screen does not appear , &apos; Reigo is muddled .
Whoever is not afraid of cold water can swimming the river because the river is full of sources .
I have been to swimming there , you can do it !
The river &apos;s water can be held long and simply romantics : One can look at the flow of the river and think about life and think about it .
I , too , have been there with my bride .
Apart from anything else , Tampere , on a river stretch between the three bridges , has even got used to the scenes : &apos; Since this place is next to the city , no one may even have to come up as their stories tell me &apos; .
&quot; A wonderful view of Tapa is emerging from the toy hill , but there are also health professionals where you can drink , skie the winter and now , for example , discgolf playing - the golf course has been taken , the chains can lend from the sports centre , &quot; Reigo presides .
The old protagonists , of course , go there with their spring , but I have not yet played there .
Obviously my colleague , Rasmus Goll , must be invited to visit Tapale , because he has experienced a discernment of discernment , and he has a supermarket .
Perhaps he will lend me !
Reigo and Männikup were inextricably inseparable from the times of their childhood .
At least during the skiing hours .
There are many tears , many disappointments to this memory and you can be seen in my sporting life .
Not to mention burnt @-@ down clocks and ski mountains .
&quot; The city as a whole is now full of construction works , all this becomes unknown , &quot; Reigo praises .
However , an old and tired shelf building is a very attractive place where oral discoveries are played .
I am pleased that , in 2012 , the leader of R.A.A.A.M adopted my idea in Meos and had to make a permanent summer theatre with his theatre .
Although this year &apos;s theatre season &apos; Alexeyi Karenin &apos; has just come to an end , on 11 August , the railway station &apos; Elluding &apos; is on its way around the 1980s .
&quot; Between 11 and 13 August , Tapa will be the city of Tapa &apos;s Day , which has woken in an open house office building and which will host a series of cultural events , including a crowd of people , &quot; says Reigo , who is just calling for a visit to the city from 9 to 11 years .
In a poor three @-@ chamber bag on 1 May , a museum has already been in place since 1994 .
&apos;Building is a small house , but there is a great deal of information and a huge amount of information &apos; , it boasts Reigo of a place full of the history of the city of Tapa , most of which focuses on the railways and on warfare .
Reigo mudgates that , if Tapal goes through all the recommended sites , the stomach will be empty , but fortunately the small city will be full of cafés .
&apos;We have such good diets and sometimes get the feeling that you are abroad when you are sitting in cafés &apos; , he describes .
Well @-@ educated and youngsters who have come to Tapa spend a lot of time in pub cafés , the seams sitting there are rubbish feeling that you are in Estonia and in your home town , but the round is a multinational company of this kind together .
I think it would be very fascinating to listen to stories from the French or American side .
Wars , yes , we are moving a lot !
In Greece , two Bulgarians were arrested for making illegal tents
Television channel bTV quoted a foreign Ministry who reported that two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for having ordered illegally .
On the morning of 1 August , a group of illegally ordered persons were arrested by the police on the island of Sithonia , including two Bulgarians .
They were released on the same day , but an investigation is under way .
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the television channel that Bulgarians were later released .
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free tendering and are already imposing heavy penalties on all those who are caught in a holiday place that is not intended to do so .
Checks will continue throughout the season .
According to the Ministry , the court may impose a fine .
The armies that teach the bullets are breaking the sheep .
The farmers on the shelf have to give their wolf &apos; educational material &apos; again after a year - the wolves that have obviously taught spawns have already burned a lot of sheep .
This year wolves in the county of Hiiu have broken sheep three times , a total of 23 sheep and eight have been injured , writing the Hiiu site .
It was only three , or 124 years earlier .
In syndrome , the Environment Agency has also found out that wolf washing machines were not born on last year &apos;s Hipe land and that the sprawl Council of Hives said that two wolves were fixed on the island this year .
Against midnight on Monday , the wolves unleashed 15 sheep in the village of Kabuana and wounded 18 of the survivors .
In the early morning of Wednesday &apos;s morning , the wolf broke one lamb on the County of the Reheil village and severely injured another , who had to be subjected to an emergency killing .
The rules on the management of genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs has sent a round of coordination to the law on the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment ( GMOs VS ) and a draft law amending plant protection law .
The amendment of the law removes the creation of a separate collection of data both for GM ( GM ) crops and operators , using a future register of plant health .
In addition , the GM crop operator is changing the obligation to have a prior agreement on the radio to apiculture .
Although no GM crops are being cultivated in Estonia at present , we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of GM and non @-@ GM crops .
At least as long as it has not been decided to declare a GMO @-@ free in Estonia , Sigmar Suu Kyi , head of the plant health department at the Department of Rural Affairs , said .
&quot; At the same time , we need to take into account that the measures we have developed need to be targeted and proportionate , taking into account the costs and administrative burden for both the private and public sectors . &quot;
The draft act repeals the provisions relating to the collection and training of GM crop locations and handlers in VS , lays down requirements for the management of the GM crop and the opening up of economic activities .
As regards beekeeping , the GM crop farmer &apos;s current obligation to inform beekeepers about the cultivation of a GM crop with the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with beekeepers before starting cultivation .
The draft law has been sent for coordination between ministries .
All interested parties will have the opportunity to familiarise themselves with this in the information system and , if they so wish , present their views to the World Department .
The proposed changes will affect , in particular , those in the plant farming sector , beekeepers and the Agriculture Agency .
Only one GM crop - mon 810 - can be cultivated in the European Union , including Estonia .
As yet , no Estonian farmer has taken an interest in cultivating a GM crop .
The reason for this is that Estonia does not have a sweet charity , a European corn for which the maize line mon 810 is resistant .
The articles on this landline have also been slaughtered for the southern regions , and this May will not be appropriate for our climate conditions .
In 2015 and 2016 , the Department of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies to detect possible contamination of GM organisms in the seeds of various types of fattening , maize and soya grown in Estonia .
The analysis of the samples carried out showed that seeds were not present and that the study concluded that the seeds of increased rape , maize and soya in Estonia did not contain genetically modified organisms .
The previous one , in turn , suggests that there is no deliberate cultivation of GM crops in Estonia , nor was it confirmed that there was no random contamination .
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United colour in the form of Nemanja Maticu &quot; egenius &quot;
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United States has hijacked a &apos; genius &apos; in the form of Nemanja Maticu , after being challenged by a central player against Samotoria on Wednesday evening .
A player bought from Chelsea for GBP 40 million started in the last seasonal game in the Unites in Dublin prior to UEFA Super Cup &apos;s line in front of Madrid on Tuesday 2 @-@ 1 in initial rivalry , giving an impression of a defensive role , while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were able to travel freely during an attack trip .
However , leaving aside the pre @-@ seasonal Asian architecture , Matica sorely missed his mammoth and received only 45 minutes , something which , according to Mourinho , must be corrected before the Premier League season began .
&apos;He needs time , but he has experience , intelligence , gene thinking - he has football champions , &apos; said Mourinho .
&quot; We will help it achieve a form as soon as possible . &quot;
In the Aviva stadium , as in the public , other new recruited Victor Lindelof and Romeva lu Lukashenko started off and Mourinho slowly started to put in place one @-@ off men to start the season .
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted to recruit three football clubs , but he confirmed that the club had already done &quot; excellent work &quot; by concluding contracts with three of its four priority options .
&quot; I am grateful to the club for being able to realise three out of four , &quot; he added .
&apos;I will be even happier if they can deliver four out of four , but they have worked very hard for me &apos; .
On 1 August and this time in Mesus , another poet walked on GSM .
According to Mati Martinson , a poultry observer , who is living in abattoirs , the first baby became an embassy in Sperry , and this washing pond is already flying around , has left the washing ground and has joined the great collection of fodder in Mullutu @-@ Great Lakes .
This is because , after all , Sham is not fertile fields , the voice of the islands writes .
This Tuesday , relatively late in coming up with courses , the Embassy received yet another bull , on the island of Mpride .
Mr Martinson said that the installation of Embassies is in fact an international project run by Mr Leito and Mr Oj .
The soil was served by a puppet called Mati GSM accompanying Sperves Turkey .
&apos;They &apos;s activities are all online : The way he went to the winter in Spain , came back on the German @-@ Polish border for a long time and then to Saareland &apos; , Mr Martinson spoke .
British inventor to install a microchip in his own body to access a handful of houses and cars
A British inventor became the first person in a country to be fitted with a microchip in order to be able to open his / her seat , get into an office and even get a car up and running with a handful .
33 @-@ year @-@ old , Steven Northam , has had to install a small chip between his trodder and his desk , and is now also offering this service to businesses and private individuals through their own Biotheq company , who want to make life easier with technology .
He has joined forces with Dr Geoff Watson , a consultant @-@ anesthesiologist in the Royal hospital of Hampshire in Hants , to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards .
The technology resembles a microchip installed on cats and dogs and only takes 30 seconds to procedure .
The Northam company also substitutes the snow of houses and cars to be compatible with the ambulance by asking for GBP 300 per snow .
This father of one child in a marriage has stayed in the technology now , both at home and in his car BMW Z4 , which will get off the ground once he has his hand on the wheel .
Eponder of the White House cost taxpayers thousands
According to military documents disclosed to the magazine , the White House &apos;s decision to fly the navy helicopter last month for an attempt to celebrate American production has cost the southern taxpayer as much as USD 24 000 .
The green and white colour , Sikorsky VH @-@ 3D , termed Marine One under the President &apos;s presidency &apos;s presidency , was the centrepiece of an event presenting the American construction programmes in the White House on 17 July .
President Donald Trump , senior officials of Vice @-@ President Mike Pence and the White House announced industrial products in all 50 states during their tour .
The helicopter set up in Connecticutis was exhibiting with a hunt from repute , a Wisconist fire @-@ fighting car and a two @-@ stroke tablet manufactured in Missister .
The Helicopter &apos;s Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX @-@ 1 ) document , in charge of operating the Helicopter , showed that the White House &apos;s military cabinet &apos;s presence was clamouring for a helicopter presence , known as the FARGO @-@ ga , in a narrow picture of 36 hours before the helicopter buried for an extraordinary event in the southern horror .
&apos;I wanted you to be aware of this , because it is an unusually high @-@ profile event , &apos; said HMX @-@ 1 commander a day before the event , in an e @-@ mail , a desert of his superiority , a naval officer .
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive in the southern horror at around 7 p.m. on the morning of 17 July and remain there until the Christmas night between 18 and 21 is cleared .
What was added was the fact that , should there be a departure from the White House , a return flight will require a second brick flight due to the restrictions on working time .
The original flight team was at the helicopter during the event , and the security team stayed near the aircraft for all the time it was on the ground .
It was not possible to find out from the documents that were submitted to the magazine whether , in the end , a second brick boat was needed or not .
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using government property for political purposes .
The documents show that HMX @-@ 1 examined whether this action could breach this provision .
&apos;We wondered whether it was a violation of Hatch &apos;s law and we were told that it would not violate , &apos; wrote commander .
&apos;It seems that you have no choice , &apos; responded to the Deputy senior officer .
The White House declared the &apos; American @-@ made &apos; event an official event , and the Hatch law would not have covered it .
But even the official events have political undertones .
At the event , the President supported the efforts of the Health Reform in the Senate at the time and praised efforts to keep government regulations in check .
Using an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Task Force for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon .
They must be used by the Presidents to travel .
However , the requirement to use them purely as a photograph is unusual .
In February , a Trump drew attention to his first campaign event , Fool Melbourne , a president &apos;s plane on a water background , and he displays Twitter &apos;s account of the messages complaining about how his predecessor used the plane .
The White House is very pleased with the display &apos; made in America &apos; of products from all 50 states produced by American workers from American materials , &apos; said Lindsay Walters , spokesman of the White House .
HMX @-@ 1 crews often perform test flights around Washington and on a southern horror in order to get used to watering down a cent @-@ metre with the US President &apos;s White House .
When the Trump was at the beginning of July at the G20 in Germany , the HMX @-@ 1 White House was carrying out 58 tests .
According to the official , the &apos; American @-@ made &apos; flight flight crew was included as the standard for the monthly study flights .
Monday &apos;s helicopters floated 11 more hours on that day for &apos; non @-@ presidential support missions &apos; .
According to the White House , none of the other exhibitors of this event burden the taxpayers &apos; purse .
Mr Sikorsky &apos;s representative said that the company was not involved in carrying out expropriation at the southern horror of the helicopter .
HMX @-@ 1 will not maintain the budgetary documents for the President &apos;s flights and the precise costs of the event will be difficult to identify .
However , the Department of Defence &apos;s prices for the financial year 2017 indicate that the VH @-@ 3D reimbursement rate is USD 24 380 per hour per flight .
The Eskadar documents indicated a flight stretch by 30 minutes from Quantico Airport to Virginia , its main base .
The White House claims that the real cost of using the helicopter is well below that amount .
&quot; Calculating taxpayers &apos; costs on the basis of estimated compensation rates is very misleading , &quot; said Walters .
&apos;That &apos;s estimated compensation rates include many other irreversible costs for staff , maintenance and expenditure which will be taken into account in the annual appropriations &apos; .
According to the rand survey of 2015 , the Department of Defence &apos;s reimbursement rates do not include personnel costs , but they cover fuel , maintenance and contract costs .
The former spokesperson of the White House , Sean Spicer , defended the use of the helicopter at the time at the event .
&apos;That is about showing things made in America this week , &apos; said Spicer .
&quot; And I know that the State of Sikorsky and Connecticut is very proud to contribute to our national security and that there are expected to be hundreds , if not thousands , of people whose work depends on it .
And I believe that just like most Americans , we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment , which so many Americans have worked tirelessly on .
So of course it is right to highlight this . &quot;
Whether or not the Trump had to deal with the helicopter during the southern horror event was or not , he was lying behind the wheel in the fire @-@ fighting car .
In the White House , Trump Sikorsky &apos;s representatives appealed to them , throwing out a mockery of a company &apos;s products in his individual aircraft fleet .
&apos;I know Sikorská very well , &apos; said the President , &apos; I have three of their products &apos; .
Gri Šadeiko - Through tears brought peace and joy
Mil Daegh in 2011 hit Šadeikot in the last area , 800 m of beverages ran a stadium , and was taken away from the stadium with the launcher .
Shortly before that , he had received a zero degree of distance from his universitualist in China .
In 2012 , Helsinki was the victim of a cheap injury , but in London , he received 6013 points 23 from the debate .
However , this misfortune has continued .
After the inaugural day , the Moscow Moma of 2013 received a remote Flash injury from an Estonian record .
Two years later , he held 15 seats in Beijing &apos;s Mil and held the Olympic orchestra , but that too had wanted more frustration on the part of the athlete .
Only last night , Šadeiko did not receive a letter of result initially from the Amsterdam EMW .
I would just like to bring together one proper multi @-@ contest once or for all .
Once &apos; , Shadeiko sprayed .
Worse still to come : A month later , his Olympic competition in Rios broke the first hurdle as a result of a reignition .
The time had to be taken down - whether to continue with the seven competitions at all ?
Is it all worth the effort of two days ?
Neiu thought for a long time , but found peace .
I was able to think clean on my head .
It is quite difficult to describe this experience , but I have wondered that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen .
Thankfully , there was time to cure ourselves healthily and think twice .
&quot; I knew I would not put a bag on my desk yet , &quot; said Šadeiko of his self @-@ cleansing .
I was able to turn the page and move forward with a new momentum .
Treener Anne mäki said that it was very difficult to look at the suffering of the careless , but she realised that the athletes themselves , above all , had to make themselves clear .
He was , after all , whistleblowed down by everyone .
It was difficult to tolerate .
&apos;The Gál said , however , that he will not give up and he wants to prove himself what he is worth &apos; says a mountain .
There is now some sort of peace in it .
He is doing so to his delight .
The contest came back in May , when Šadeiko set 6280 points in a new Estonian record in a series of competitions between Gidel zis .
In a high @-@ level contest , she improved her personal high @-@ level bull mesh with almost a metre ( 13.89 ) and ran at a record near @-@ time barrier .
There was then a multi @-@ competitor who felt that this was not at all possible , but that only the initial starvation was extinguished .
A mountain who guided him for years says that Šadeiko is a black pupil .
She is an athletic ; she is a good teacher .
If something is wrong or wrong , he says it now .
He knows his own body and entrusts his own sense .
That is the starting point .
I cannot say exactly what to do and follow it up .
Šadeiko has also found a new approach .
&apos;I am not the one who makes the maximum of the trend &apos; , he talks and says that the most important thing is to get the feeling right , because it also ensures a good result .
Baby baby boomers are happy
The good emotion has also been offered the good luck of the people who are close .
Both his former training fellow Member , Maris mountain , and sister de Grete , have recently become parents and have received support from new weather citizens .
&apos;It has been quite interesting &apos; , says Šadeiko .
One alcohol whose drinking is tantamount to the brain &apos; training &apos; .
Livestrong writes that Dr Gordon Sheperd is even such a big wine fans that he believes that wine can train better than any other part of the world .
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University .
He says that this is not about alcohol or about how it affects our feelings and our ideas , but about the &apos; very active &apos; process of tapping wine .
By whistleblowing a glass , by stirring it up , enjoying it and discerning a aftertaste , we are putting our brains on the job of creating a taste for wine .
Sheperdi said that the bovine puppies do not actually contain a taste , but that the taste is generated by the way in which the wine stimulates the brain .
He makes a comparison between how the brain sees the colour .
&quot; Taste is not wine , taste creates a taste for wine , &quot; says Sheperd .
The things that still affect the taste of a wine are , for example , our age , our gender and even the amount of heart that a man produces .
Sheperd , of course , admire that wine is not so full of hair .
&apos;More must be done &apos; , he says .
If you get too fat , the system is over @-@ saturated .
Excessive drinking of wine can do harm instead of brains - according to a 2004 study , people who drink more than three glass with wine , memory loss , loss of balance and reduced mental capacity risk .
10 % of ICT sector workers in Estonia pay less than colleagues
Data from the personnel @-@ search company Fontes reveals that 10 % of workers in the Estonian ICT sector are paid less than colleagues .
The 10 % pay gap is between men and women , the Geenius portal writes .
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the Fund &apos;s ICT sector wage study .
A total of 8 577 posts were examined .
63 % of the posts were male .
&quot; While only 3 companies concluded that the pay gap is for men and that there is no pay gap for the rest of companies , in reality , compared to the reality , the monthly basic salary for men is on average 10 % higher than that for women and an average 8 % higher than for men &apos;s , &quot; said Fontes analysis Ilmar North .
Narcose 3 season advertising clip : Now that Pablo Escobar has gone , the Cali cartel takes centre stage in the Netflix Hittsdoctor
Even though the killer of Pablo Escobar was revealed in the second season of &apos; Narcos &apos; , the Netflix sari is far from over .
The third and fourth seasons have been confirmed by the streaming service , the first being a advertising clip designed to crack down on the horns with the new wrecks .
In the third season , the DEA will turn its attention to the world &apos;s richest drug business organisation , the Cali cartel .
They are acting under the chairmanship of four powerful crosses &apos; like Fortune 500 companies &apos; , simply with more bribery to the government and more violent acts .
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela ( Damian Alcazar ) is the head of the cartel , with Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela ( Francisco Denis ) its athev , Pacho Herrera ( Alberto Ammann ) leading links with Mexico and Chepe Santamentariz London ( Pepe Rapazote ) operating in New York .
The newly released advertising clip sees Pedro Pascali return to Javier Penana as a factor recruiting American and Colombian legal protection against drugs in the war .
Other new actors include Matias Varela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt Whelan , Miguel Angel Silvestre , Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro .
The third season of &apos; Narcos &apos; will open on 1 September .
According to the UN , Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
The head of the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that the elections can only represent the people if all members of society , including women , play a role in them .
Nicholas Haysom , the leader of the United Nations Assistance Mission , said that hundreds of women would stand for election in local Soviet elections , three women would stand as Vice @-@ President and more than 30 % of the newly registered voters would be women .
&quot; It is not possible to overstate the role of women by underlining it , &quot; he said in a statement made on Wednesday .
The elections can truly represent the people and can only be credible if women are fully involved and involved in all stages of the electoral process .
Elections and presidential elections in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April .
The Taliban , for their part , have threatened the electoral process , which coincides with a transition period in which the role of international military operations will become consultative .
This year &apos;s elections mark the first time that power has been transferred calmly from one democratically elected government to the next .
Malysom says that a strong role for women increases democracy success in Afghanistan .
According to the Afghanistan Independent electoral Commission , 1.2 million of the 3.6 million voters have registered with women .
The delight of division makes both large and small every thing more acute .
There is always too little time in common , but the trend is a good opportunity to combine meeting , play , closeness and burden .
And what a convenient solution - wherever you are in the summer , living accessories are always with you and impatiently remember with your little voter : &apos; Let us make a move now ! &apos;
With warm insulation , it is very good to have a normal game of gold or to slip through a coastline .
Which is the basic pillar of survival in the form of shoes and winds , so who would like to take the form of an sand code stunned by waves during the summer ?
It is wonderful to have children instead of cannabis !
Firstly , it is safe and comfortable , and the difficulty is gradually increasing at the same pace as the staff of the trainer .
Advanced energy can also be hunted with quite a large number of children .
The child is training the balance , reading the corps and feeling lax on the possibility of beating high and important .
Larger children can , at the same time , hunt for themselves .
The extent of the movement is in place with regard to land @-@ grabbing and tying .
Keep your fingers straight , the pale in the mini @-@ jungle properly .
The child can read the flats and feel like a trainer .
The planet is an enormous but hopelessly boring exercise for the child .
But it is easy to relax !
Game @-@ plank : Take a long planguoln from which to tear roughshod .
In fact , it is more difficult than usual , but much more amusing , to do than in the meantime , to hand over to a friend .
A plant , a tear market , can be maintained to add the burden and can also be walked around in this location .
A little bit more can be put on the winters of a smaller child , but the habit offers fun for all children .
While crabs in the sand strawberries become a rope , ash and air meat burden as contacted .
The child keeps on his feet in such a way that his or her body is evenly distributed in advance and behind .
A hand can be kept in check for tourism .
Sliver legs and stall straight up .
The sun can fly , relax , strike a balance and be difficult .
The life of a small engineer is an exhortation when he gets small things every time he arrives .
The additional burden will be to pre @-@ empt the bicycle .
Check that it remains in a neutral position .
The children themselves have a great deal of amusement to make in a couple and with a plate .
A cook with a pulse and a pulse .
This followed a child &apos;s safety , an agonising position , and kept a back in a neutral position .
Every child &apos;s favourite and great fun !
For a parent , however , the entire body trenn is truly effective .
Sport tools included Ott ( 10 ) , Säde ( 8 ) , happiness ( 4 ) .
Travelling from the Philippines to the heart of moefficient scans in the wider world - Applgkot
Timeline bags are a summer class which , in recent years , has become a fait accompli in one of the right skippers , which has to be hanged at the end of their hand and which has been used by merchants , regardless of their modest origin , to display an additional price label for hitic .
The sickening bag is probably one such thing that has existed once in life and which has not been aroused by much emotion .
It simply does exist and , if it does not exist , there is no overlap .
Now , on the other hand , beer bags are making a real race , and the scans have switched their sophisticated designer bags from simple beer bags for summer months .
That being the case , not only is it not a coastdog , but today it is also just as popular as a street chamber , and more courageous women are even walking into the office .
At this point , however , it is worth making it clear , before doing so , whether such an summer roaming is or whether it is worth having a wet and a laptop computer pushed a little into the official summer .
However , this diversity has made a genuine summer love of women from brewers .
The first thing to do , for example , when reading foreign moillogists , is to note that , on holiday , the moeoghurts are the first thing to do in the local market and acquire some beer bags , which are then the proverge of a full holiday and which go along with beach , the market and also , as a friend , with a woman on the city &apos;s doorstep .
Some bloggers are even so generous that they buy a larger wolf on the market and sell or give them away to their loyal readers .
It is also worth noting that there is so much demand among readers that women ( and men ! ) in the real world , apparently , go on to each other to become a lucky owner for some homes .
To some extent , this madness is also understandable , as rare times are when , in fashionable fashion , it is possible to buy things for a few decades .
It is true that rosy traders have also discovered easy money to make here , and so more sophisticated luxury brands also sell cocktails for a few hundred euros and a few thousand euros .
Obviously , in order to prevent richer customers from having to feel like simple mortality , who try around with some cheap dogs .
For example , Dolce &amp; Gabbana can buy a beating bag of over a thousand euros .
However , for the interpretation of the Chanel brewery , EUR 6 000 can be proposed in the circuit .
However , unlike most of the modelled buildings , the beer doesn &apos;t inherit at all from some of the great Cape Verde , but their story started far beyond .
Indeed , beer bags are said to originate far from the Philippines , where they have been worn off .
Flowing cows is primarily an export business there , and very often no business can be seen across the local community .
Reportedly , the flourishing technique dates back to the 14th century and is rather rife with the usual basket .
However , because the beer does not have to be red as much as the cork , it will become inhabited muscles and other materials that make the cocktail more personalised and , by extension , more progressive .
Recently , for example , trendy bags in particular , where paint strips or skins have been cooked in .
However , an actress &apos;s Jane Birkini can be sent first and foremost by translation bags , of which the largest red brush of beer fans had not been seen before .
Indeed , he even fitted the brewing bag to all sorts of clothing complexes and did not need to go so much to the Cannes Film Festival .
However , what does not play a smaller role today in the popularity of applicants , however , is that looking after them is a dawn and , unlike all the other summer products , they do not have to be cared for by these special funds , but water and martyr dirty are also doing it .
As always in the case of trendy robbery initiatives , other than the classical appearance , brands have come up with all sorts of interpretations .
For example , if you wish , you can acquire a bundled cloak from beer beer or a tiny treasure bag .
At the same time , it is worth remembering that a classical beer will never go from fashion to beer flu .
But what is the classical brewing , then ?
For centuries , this kind of straw of beer , reminiscent of its style , has been considered classical and has been opened on the spot and has been short , as well as on beer .

A missing man was found on the island land three days ago .
On Wednesday evening , you left your home in Kärla &apos;s Alevi unknown .
The telephone positioning was the last contact on the phone yesterday , Friday evening and the telephone positioning gave the man a seat on the west island , the village of Milles , from which he was searched with a helicopter to midnight and with dogs to his property .
He then became empty on his phone and his whereabouts were no longer possible .
The police continued their searches this morning .

GMB is concerned about investments at the McVitie plant in Glasgow
The trade union is expected from the leaders of a mature producer , McVitie , about long @-@ term production plans at the company &apos;s Glasgow plant .
According to GMB Scotland , the company has remained silent on the future of the investment site .
More than 500 people are employed when Hobnobsi and the rich know the cookies and other products are produced .
The owner of the McVitie company , Mr Pladis , said that he had invested more than GBP 5 million in the site over the last few years .
Workers and trade union chairmen were employed there &apos; are the first to hear &apos; as something changes in the operation of the plant &apos; .
In a letter to the CEO of the company , GMB Scottish company McVitie appealed &apos; for concerns that funding would not be used to modernise production lines &apos; .
The GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy said , &apos; The fact that we do not get clarity from the head of the object on the business needs of Customs and the future investment plan is a cause for deep concern among our Members .
Many generations of families have been employed here , and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and people around the Glasgow region , an essential pillar for ensuring proper employment in a region with high unemployment and social exclusion .
Thus the East of Glasgow needs a thriving manufacturing company in McVitie in terms of jobs , wages and well @-@ being , and Brex , in view of the rise in living costs and the chronic fall in production . &quot;
The planned representative said : &apos; The head of the customs broadcasting site received a letter from GMB Scotter only yesterday , and the company will reply to him directly because we value active contact with workers and trade union representatives .
Two months ago , a regular meeting was held between workers and representatives of the GMB in Customs and openly discussed a number of issues .
We then discussed with the workers that , like all other companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate , we are reviewing what we are doing in an ongoing way - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - in order to ensure that we are competitive .
He added : &apos; In recent years , we have invested more than GBP 5 million in the customs transfer site , most of it having gone into production lines and improving operations .
We fully understand customs interoperability as an object of production and , should there be any change in its activities , workers and trade unionists will be the first to hear about it . &quot;
Did the PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about taking an approach to Neymarii ?
With la la it may regret its interest in Marco Verratt
The Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not give up efforts to attract Neymar to his ranks by making an offer of GBP 189 million to buy him out , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of this record seizure trip ?
This thorny approach has opened the summer &apos;s transition window , and the Ligue 1 club is ready to shake up more than twice the current world record of overpurchasing set by Paul Pogba &apos;s return to Manchester Unites for GBP 89 million last season .
Once the transition has been completed , Neyra will become the most expensive player in the world as well as the most highly paid professional athlete in the world who , after taxes , will be paid over GBP 500 000 a week .
Barcelona is also , of course , angry because of both the approach and the break @-@ up of Neymari , although the source close to Catalansi &apos;s governing board confirms that the club has always looked after the best since its arrival in Santo 2013 .
But did the PSG President warn the world of the football world of such an opportunity three years ago ?
When Manchester City showed an interest in the conclusion of the Blaise Matued Agreement in 2014 , Nasser Al @-@ Khelaif strongly warned all the clubs thinking about recruiting some of the best PSG players .
&apos;I am not concerned because they know that , when they concern some of our players , we stand up to them and make contact with their players , &apos; said Al @-@ Khelaif .
&quot; We respect all clubs .
But when they try to enter into an agreement with some of our players , they will have to face the consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have gone beyond this limit , as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed an interest in Marco Verratti , the PSG central player .
The PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could suffer a setback as a result of this interest by removing one of its precious assets in the form of Neymari .
Prime Minister : Ireland wants to build bridges , not borders , after Brexitit .
&quot; Brex is seriously threatened with a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland , Great Britain and Ireland , &quot; warned Varadkar on his first visit to Northern Ireland after he took office in June .
&quot; I cannot imagine who would benefit from it , &quot; he added .
Cross @-@ border infrastructure projects made the current free movement of people and goods possible , said Varadkar .
&quot; This is our vision for the future : Building bridges , not borders , &quot; he stressed .
He said earlier that he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union , and because that cannot happen , he will remain part of the European single market .
This would maintain the current free trade between the Irish Republic and the United Kingdom .
Another way to make Britain &apos;s departure smoother would be to set up a European Union @-@ United Kingdom Customs Union , explaining to the Irish Prime Minister .
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey , Varadkar said , &apos; We could certainly have this with Britain &apos; .
The alternative to this would be a return to customs points that would declare historical divisions and political failure .
&apos;Let &apos;s bring about trade , prosperity and peace &apos; said the Irish Prime Minister .
She mentioned Brex &apos;s &apos; challenge for our generation &apos; and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland &apos;s daily lives .
Irish Prime Minister Belfast met with leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland .
Avand , through her first half @-@ long triathlon , everyone will be able to get through Ironman .

A collection of 70.3 miles consisted of 1.9 km of swimming , 90 km of cycling and 21.1 km cycling .
Among others , the first triathlon of his life has also been triumphed off by Mrs Avand .
&quot; I thought it would be difficult and , in the end , difficult , &quot; said Avand finish .
Despite the difficulty , Mrs Avand , in fact , the triumph is manageable for almost everyone .
&quot; Not the dance kills , but the pace kills , &quot; he said , suggesting that , at an appropriate rate , everyone would reach the finishing line .
Except for Ott Sepp , &apos; If you like it is fine , you cannot swimming &apos; .
Avand had already been doing a good job since February .
Initially 4 @-@ 5 hours a week , and later ten hours a week .

Although Avand lost both Raio Piiro ( time 04 : 59 : 53 ) and Jürgen Ligi ( time 05 : 06 : 37 ) , she won other so @-@ called &apos; prominent classes &apos; competing .
Last year , Tanel Padar , who was a &quot; good example for individuals &quot; , lost to Avan in seven minutes ( time of 05 : 41 : 54 ) , journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes ( time 05 : 50 : 23 ) , Kalev Krnew and Raivo E. Tampere in about an hour ( times 06 : 31 : 53 and 06 : 45 : 18 ) .
The overall winner of the &apos; Otepää &apos; cycle of men , part of the Ironman series , was a German , Johannes Moldan , with 3 : 58 : 27 ; Estonians with Ivo &apos;s best : 14 : 09 .
