Four Cape Verde group members were detained in Estonia and Spain
According to postal law, in Spain, the head of the so-called Cape Verde group, Sval Gulevich, a leader of the Estonian Union, is detained by the police, known as' Cape Verde ', in the criminal world.
Gulevich detained in Spain was arrested on trial permission.
Yesterday, the Court also arrested three suspects in Estonia.
The suspicion is that members of the so-called Cape Verde criminal association are aged between 27 and 57, who are mainly responsible for drug crimes.
In the province of Mala in Spain, the alleged leader of the criminal organisation was detained.
In Estonia, three men were arrested as suspects, one of whom is, according to data, one of the leading figures of the criminal organisation, and two are members of the criminal organisation.
The data collected indicates that there was a clear division of tasks and roles within the criminal community.
The purpose of the criminal community's activities was to commit drug crimes and thus generate criminal profits, "commented the head of the pre-trial criminal proceedings, the public Prosecutor VasilVerte.
"We do not exclude an increasing circle of suspected criminals in this case," added the Prosecutor.
These are people who have been in the interest of law enforcement authorities in the past, and some have been punished for drug crimes.
Verte stressed that cooperation with my Spanish colleagues has been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us and this week's operation shows the success of this cooperation," said Public Prosecutor Verte.
The head of the Central Criminal Police Department, ago Leis, said that detention was preceded by an investigation going on for nearly one and a half years.
"In the first half of the week, we realised long-standing work while suspected of committing crimes in Estonia and Spain," he said.
It added that central police officers were instrumental in detention in Spain.
For years now, we have had good contacts and understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard.
These arrests are yet another message to the criminals that we can get them out of another European end, "said Leis.
The information gathered up to now clearly indicates that, in freedom, suspected men can continue to commit new crimes, which is why the prosecution service requested and approved by the Court of Justice.
A man arrested in Spain is waiting for his surrender to Estonia.
Under this criminal case, property, vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure confiscation.
The criminal case before the trial is organised by the Central Criminal Police Office for organised crime and is managed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The Tallinn City Court sentenced Mr Gulevich in 2005 to blackmail and punished him with five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevitch was considered the second most important man in the criminal world of Estonia following the then alliances of Nicolai Tarankov.
Cape Verde, Mr Gulevich, came to the head of Estonia in the early 1990s, when he started to engage in blackmail in Tallinn.
Admittedly, he taxed taxes taxis and prostitution for various hotels and claimed monthly roofing fees for businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscation of criminal assets and entry into force of judgments confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest judgments, eight defendants of the so-called Dikyev criminal community who were confiscated EUR 80 000 in criminal assets, or nine individuals who had been sentenced to the effect that Igor Aleynikov set up a criminal association in 2006 aimed at the illegal trade in, and the crime of, smuggling and trafficking in, cigarettes in Eastern and Southern Estonia.
The seizures of criminal assets amount to nearly EUR 71 500.
In these criminal matters, it has ensured success that police officers exchange information and evidence every day with their counterparts abroad and, if necessary, carry out joint activities in any country of the European Union.
Civil rights group warns Missourisse about travelling
The National Association for the People of Colored People (NAACP) has warned Missourisse-travelling black people against discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the State.
The statement of the group reads: 'The NAACP travel mark for the State of Missouri, which runs until 28 August 2017, calls on all African American passengers, visitors and Commons to be particularly attentive and extremely cautious as they move around the State, given the dubious racial events which have taken place recently across the State and which have been pointed out here'.
According to NALN, both the recent Missouri law making it harder to win cases of discrimination and the fact that minorities are the targets of state law enforcement to an uneven extent.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They are taken as a result of their skin colour, beaten or killed, 'said Ro Chapel, President of the NAACP Missouri branch, to The Kansas City Star.
'We have never received such close complaints before '.
This is the first such warning that an organisation has issued against a US state.
The group's expression refers to events such as racist insults against black students at Missouri University and the death of the 28-year-old black story Sandersi, Tennessee.
Sanders died at the beginning of this year in dubious circumstances, after having been through petrol in transit through the state and under arrest without charge of a crime by the Missouri police.
In addition, the comment refers to a recent report by the Chief Prosecutor of Missouri, which shows that the cars of black drivers are likely to be stopped by 75% higher than those of the white men in the state.
'The comment is intended to make people aware and warn their families, friends and working partners about what can happen in Missouris' said Chapel.
'People must be ready, whether it means taking on bail-in money or informing relatives that they are going through the State '.
According to the latest information from the FBI Programme on hate crime, a hundred hate crime was recorded in Missouris in 2015, placing the State in its sixteenth place, in terms of the number of similar offences.
A travel warning is also a response to a new law by Missouri, which makes it difficult to appeal to the company's courts for discrimination in search of housing or work.
The American Civil Society Union (American Civil Society Union) had previously issued travel notes for Texas and Arizona, following the adoption of immigration laws by these states, which obliged the local authorities to arrest people for immigration offences because, according to the ACLU, this increases racial profiling.
Normally, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issues travel warnings about other countries, but recently interest groups have started to use this measure as a reaction to certain US laws and trends.
Hepatitis: What would anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or liver combustion, may be caused by five different hepatitis A, B, C, D and E.
All these viruses provoke a liver-torn combustion.
However, the unhealthy cost is chronic hepatitis B and C, which can continue to be a liver circus, or a liver horse and liver cancer.
Kuwar, an epidemiological Adviser of the Health Agency, states that the phenomenon of acute hepatitis disease is the same for all types of liver-burning: Fever, fatigue, plundering, birth, poppy, dirty pain, grey exodus, we end up with horse mackerel, meat and class pain, and snam and hythollahs.
The crowded name of liver-burning also comes from the last hour of disease.
Children can experience hepatitis without disease.
It is only possible to determine the various types of arsenal based on laboratory research data.
Over-hepatitis can become chronic hepatitis and go on without disease for decades, which means that you may not know anything about your harmful liver disease.
Mr Kuwar points out the various forms of hepatitis and describes their evolution in greater detail.
Hepatitis viruses the disease from man to person and infects us when eating contaminated food or drinking water, by breadth, by beans and from a few foodstuffs, soils, objects, meals and drug consumption.
A hepatitis infection is caused by family members and carers at risk of disease, people suffering from chronic liver diseases, people who are infected by sex, men who are sex with men, drug addicts, passengers who visit countries with high hepatitis A.
Infection can be prevented by vaccination, in particular, by recommending vaccination for people who travel a lot and who are at risk of hepatitis A.
Furthermore, it is important to comply with daily hygiene requirements: To wash or disinfect hands, before being used for food, to wash all fruit and vegetables.
B. Hepatitis viruses ill to come into contact with the blood of the human being, injection of drugs, pathogens, honour treatment, blood-contaminated fometers (dentists, means of pregnancy), donor blood, hepatitis, sex and hepatitis disease from animals / newborn babies.
Synant drug users at risk of hepatitis infection, sex partners of the infected person, sex men with men, newborn mothers of the infected mother, sick family members and carers, blood and other body liquids are exposed to health care, rescue workers and police, and passengers visiting countries with high hepatitis B.
In order to prevent hepatitis, it is possible to vaccinate people; in particular, it is recommended that people from the at-risk group be vaccinated, as well as those suffering from chronic liver diseases, HIV infections, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
B) The other preventive measures against hepatitis are: Prevention of the use of alien hygiene and manicyms, other sharp tools and needles, reparation and honour, and use of condoms in the event of a dangerous mixture of infection or the prevention of sexual risk behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis b is part of the national immunisation scheme and is free of charge for children in Estonia.
Hepatitis C viruses ill to come into contact with human blood, injection of drugs, pathogens, honour treatment, blood-contaminated foetal use, donor blood, hepatitis-infected sex sex and hepatitis-ill foetuses / infants.
Syndrove drug users at risk of hepatitis C infection, infected people's sex partners, sex men with men, newborn mothers of infected mother, sick family members and carers, blood and other body liquids are exposed to health care, rescue workers and police officers, HIV infections, and passengers visiting countries with hepatitis.
Hepatitis C is a preventive measure: Prevention of the use of alien hygiene and manure devices, other sharp tools and needles, refinement and honour-relief, and use of condoms in the event of a dangerous mixture of infection.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D causes hepatitis, which is rife in the presence of hepatitis B.
As a result, hepatitis D suffers from infection with hepatitis B or from chronic hepatitis B as a form of super-infection.
D hepatitis viruses exposure to blood and other body liquids, contaminated needles, sexually and rarely infected foetuses.
Hepatitis hepatitis is a chronic hepatitis B virus and non-human immune to hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination against hepatitis B, which also protects people from infection with hepatitis D.
Hepatitis viruses feeble drinking water and food, including little heat-treated beef, fish and marine shellfish, donor blood, collective needles and infected animals from a mother.
Passengers may be infected by hepatitis in high morbidity countries.
Hygiene requirements are in place for hepatitis prevention measures: Washing or disinfecting hands after beating, before cooking and eating, after sick care.
Fruits and vegetables pre-consumption, prevent the feeding of little heat-treated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug consumption.
Although competitors attempted to printing off the four-year Olympic winners on the last round, the 34-year-old Farah has found power in the final straight and won over 26.49.51.
Farah did not mean long enough to take the husband Tania and the children with him after the finch.
This was a special moment for me.
I very much love my family.
It was wonderful to be on their path, "said Farah to the journalists.
Farah aims at the fifth title competition in London, which is running from 5 000 to 10 000 metres of gold.
Everything is possible when there is a belief in it.
In spite of the title, Anne-Marie O'Conimii's' Daam gold ', a wonderful story of Gustamer Climate's masterpiece, Adel Bloch-Baueri's tree's special story, goes far beyond the birth of a artistic act in the late 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century in Vienna.
But even more deeply in history.
A more narrow subject would have been allowed to have a greater impact on the extraordinary foam allowed in the title.
At the moment, the story of Atel Bloch-Baueri, which was portrayed by a Good Climate and his painting in Daam gold, and a much larger and more comprehensive newspaper from esteemed Jewish families and German occupation, with its implications in Austria, would be like some of them.
The first third of the book leads, in the middle of a wedding Vienna cultural life, and who was himself in the Austrian capital, can hardly imagine how life went around Ringstrass more than a hundred years ago or how the Central coffee all turned their heads when the climate came in.
The concentration of cultural figures in one of Europe's richest cities was a high and well-known name, seeing itself as if it were more like a grams of culture.
However, the fact, for example, that Sigmund Freud acted in a city where proliferation of untreated arson and Europe was the highest level of suicide, creates a development story like nothing more.
Or perhaps, however, every single batch of beauty will add colour to the culture of Vienna at the beginning of the 20th century.
Dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
In the last few decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews had exploded in Vienna, turning into the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
Almost one in ten Viin inhabitants had an exchange of views.
Avana, too, were newcomers in Vienna, but by the time the helplessness of Arad was twice opening up with the Czech sugar magnaad Ferdinand Bloch and climate for his famous paintings, his father had already received the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But the whole glamorous life he belonged to was not taken.
If you look at the 'Daami gold', it is hard to believe that, in the end of life, it was infected by a great Lady socialism and dreamt of travelling from the Soviet Union.
By 1933, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his husband's portfolio from Climate, the hot-day painting officer in Vienna was the last minute.
The client ordered at that time cost 4 000 kroons, a quarter of the price of a well-established rural house.
The fact that, in some of the tree, the champion's armire was suspected of having been modelled, the sugar magnate was not intimidated.
As far as Afias is concerned, the only sure fact is that the close relationship between the modelli and the artist that has emerged during the work has continued throughout life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "Daam gold."
Mr Bloch-Baueri's special story of Gustamt Climate Cup, "Varrak 2016, which translated Aldo Randlands from English.
Just before the start of the work with Adelee, the Climate was visited by Ravenna San Vitale, and the investigators think that the brilliant mosaic mosams that we have just seen there, from Imodora, gave the artist the idea of making a golden tree of Adeletion a colour as a mosaic.
The client was presented in Vienna in 1968 in his "Daami gold" and around the same time (1907-1908) another golden land was born in the "novel" area.
The artistic historians did not fail to notice the similarity of the two women.
How is Hitler about nature?
"I think I owe him to remember my friend Climate to make his way to the public ', Atel Bloch-Bauer wrote to the Director of the Belvedere Museum a few years after he left the artist (Climate died in February 1918) to go to the Museum of the Belvedere Museum and wanted their family's Climate collections to go to the museum.
Six years before the death penalty, the customer had completed another tree of Adeletion.
In his willness (in February 1925), he also asked her husband to leave her two porters and four Good Climate Museum to Austrian Galer.
She inherited her beloved words to Maria and Luil.
One year after the Climate had finished the 'Austrian Mona Annex', an attempt had been made to get into the Akademine of the Kathmandaries of Vienna, a 17-year-old Adolf Hitler, but failed in the drawing room.
Although, at times, Hitler's later anti-Semitism is considered to have not been accepted by Jewish professors as a result of the anti-Semitism, none of his excavators was actually Jews.
In any case, the role of the Austrian Galer, which was referred to in Maria wilment, had changed considerably by 1939, and it was important to find pleasing works for the Nazis in Vienna from the rich Jewish arts.
Hitler's personal artistic wealth was matched by some work at home, but not by those of the climate.
Sixty years after the March of the Nazis, a 10-year dispute between the Austrian Government and the heirs of Bloch-Baumers began.
It should only be noted here that, if the 'novel' can be seen in the Belvedere Castle in Vienna, Adel Bloch-Bauer's depiction of the 'Daami gold' is to be viewed from New York to Neue Galer.
And before Vienna, to read through the aforementioned book.
Even if you do not plan to look at the work of the Climate, because my emotions at least revolved around Nazi and Jewish issues more after the book was closed than the 135 million dollar-sold sweet Adel Bloch-Bauer.
So it is not so much a married tree, rather than a tribal embassy - and it is a very moving story.
The orientation of events at the beginning of the book has greatly facilitated the relatives of the Bautes.
17-year old swimming in Canada was very close to the Estonian record
In living life, the gold used to be 200 m of insecticide very close to the personal record of 16.62.
The Tippmark dates from a 17-year-old festival a week ago, when the Canadian football Championship won 2.16.58, Priit Aavik's Ujum blog.
Gold ended up perhaps in ten final zones A-finals.
In the final hall, he went through the distance of 2.15.76 and achieved a good seventh place with a new powerful March of excellence.
The Estonian record of Alina Kendzior (2.15.13) left the Golden for just over half a second.
Gold has risen third in an all-time ranking in Estonia, and its fresh personal peak is the fifth result ever in Estonia.
A young hope for the future is still starting at Canada's adult Championship with 100 m, 200 m and 400 m in whistleblowing, and 200 mm and 400 m in bundling.
Last week in Toronto, we had the Canadian football Championship, and the gold started off there as well.
He won 200 m in whistleblowing for silver medals during 2.03.22.
It was so quickly swamped as an act of distance last year by 2008.
The Golden season is one that only Estonia's record, Elina Partarka, has distanced itself from.
Another winner in the Canadian patronage is the brong medal in a wonderful personal record, with a new Estonian March of peak of 56.66.
For example, the year-old Kertu ly Alnek of her year-old Kertu has moved away by just one century faster.
He reached a further 100 m in the field of swimming in the theatre in an open exchange of information at 1.03.69.
At a longer distance, it only gained its seventh seat when it drove in the final seat at 2.17.31.
Gold is currently in charge of four different rankings of the Estonian season.
President Trump goes on holiday, critics fuel toothms
The time for holidays is now - that also means a relaxation for the US President Donald Trups.
However, since Trump has so far been the President who has taken the most holiday days, critics are already sparking teeth.
According to the US hub CNN, 17-day leave is planned by the President at the unspent traditional golf club Bedminster in New Jersey.
Although the President's holiday began yesterday, anti-Trup leave has been spoken about for a week.
They are giving the Olympic Games a clean-up all too often.
Indeed, the President has an unspent week exchange time in his Florida, Virginia and New Jersey cotton.
Incidentally, Trump has no longer had the clearest president in his 196 terms of office.
For example, George W. Bush had already reached 67 days on holiday with Barack Obama less than half the Trump, but 21 days.
However, the Olympic Games tend to forget things quickly.
A few days after becoming President, Trump's programme called '60 minutes' said that there would be no time for long holidays for his proposer, because there is a great deal of work to be done.
He also objected to Barack Obama's holiday three years ago.
The current President wrote on Twitter at the time: 'While Obama is on holiday, golf, solemn and junior groups are playing on their solemn lines, in Italy journalists are pulling their heads out.'
The 17-day golf club visit does not, according to the officials of the White House, have any relaxation at all.
Instead, it is officially called 'work holidays', during which the Olympic Games have no time to read or to engage in any other kind of activity.
In addition, leave had to be for another reason.
That is, the western system of the White House is being replaced by a special structure, which is why all the staff had to leave it.
The West wing is also based on Ovalry's office and other presidential premises.
"I do not think any of you would like to be in the West in August if there were 38 degrees and no office pension for the White House," said Lindsay Walters, the spokesperson for the White House, who stressed that the President would continue to work during his holiday.
Where President Trump will spend 17 days next, you will get some idea of the video.
Blocking critics on Facebook: Do not apply for national office unless you tolerate voters' criticism
Our father knew a lot about unfavourable media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers did not go long to start bullying him for everything from internal politics to political principles.
He was, of course, upset by the criticism.
However, he did not force his critics to remain silent.
Because in 1783 Washington said that 'freedom of expression can be taken away from us, and in darkness and silence we can be led like sheep on slaughterhouses'.
This brings me to Maryland's Governor, Larry Hogan, who has to work hard to be more Washington-like.
The housekeeping has blocked and deleted the possessions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And later this week, he was therefore taken to court by the American Civil Liberties Union (Civil Liberties Union).
The governor's office picked up the action empty and web commentators were riddled with counter-reactions in the style of 'who is interested?'
'That is just Facebook, 'many said.
But that matters.
And that is particularly important when it comes to a man like Hogan.
It is an amazing popular Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state.
His discharge percentage is the second highest among the 50 governors in the country.
It is not an unthinkable whistleblower.
He has been leading the state firmly and firmly rooted in his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook as the main tool for communicating with his constituents quite deliberately, for example, by putting his head off his stone for the first time after a chemical waste.
Thus, the Governor's website in interoperability is a public forum with official marking, managed by blocking the personnel paid by taxpayers on dollars' wages for people visiting property, which is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview given to The Washington Posselt, the spokesperson of the Hogan press, defended the behaviour of the Governor, claiming that blocking comments was nothing more than moderate.
But it is all too easy to paint a picture of online check-ups, spammers or people full of anger.
The post had discussions with a number of quite people whose Hogan was blocked.
That is exactly what they are about, in contact with their chosen leaders: The teacher, the company's owner and passport holder, not Internet controls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, considered and not rosy at all.
Pastor quoted the Bible in his post, oppressing the Hogan Catholic movement.
A lawyer from Bowie, Lakshm Sarma Raman, did not incite hatred, but rather hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I am disappointed because he has not responded to hate crime or other recent news," he wrote in the heading of the news story of The mail.
"Nor do I like the idea that when many people comment on the same subject, some call it an indifference to a collective effort rather than admit that they are a great many concerned citizens."
What the Governor's officials called 'targeted spam attack' would probably invite others' to 'public support'.
The Facebook era can easily reconcile messages by simply blocking criticism or deleting negative comments.
It is much cleaner than in the past when, in order to do the same, the workers had to be expelled so that they could gather and burn the newspapers with critical editorial letters, or arrest the protestors and make them remain silent.
But that is exactly what is happening now, purely digital.
The Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for making Facebook and other social media toothless.
President Trumpi has taken Twitter users to court and has been blocked from Twitter's stream.
One of the first landmark judgments on this subject was given last week in Virginia.
In Alexandria, the US District Judge James C. Cacheris decided that the Chairwoman of the County Board of supervisors of Loudouni broke the first amendment of the constitution when he blocked the constituent from his Facebook page.
In Kenntuckys, for example, the use of ACLU Facebook and Twitter, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also visited.
It should not be so difficult.
During Washington, affordable postal costs had the same effect as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers and anonymous writers damned in his way of leadership.
Even then, Washington had to deal with anonymous controls.
People wrote letters to newspapers in pseudo-onyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making up for Washington's decisions.
In accordance with the historical documents collected under the project to collect letters from George Washington on-line George Washington, he burned his cabinet under petitions criticising his views on the friendship, Trade and shipping agreements with Britain.
However, he did not force them to remain silent.
Freedom of expression, dissent and debate are the foundations of our country.
And proper management means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes the comfort of the territory of Renaissance Clois
The former European Chairperson Ronan Rafferty hopes home territory for convenience in the next three days when the East Lothiani Renaissance Club's golf courses are held at 25.
The Northern Irishman, who was in the vicinity of Archerfield Links last year on the road ahead of the last round before Paul Ealousting, is attached to the new scene and is playing the role of Ambassador of the club founder and CEO, Jerry Soledi, rather than his seat.
"I saw the Renaissance Club being built, and now we see a club stunning in full soul of this event," said Rafferty.
"Players see the path as best at their best, it is in a state of excellence.
Jerry has done an excellent job in building this place.
He is a keen supporter of the golf game and proud of what he has achieved here.
This will allow an excellent presentation of the path. "
An Englishman ever awaits with interest to be able to defend the title for the first time, even though the man has won both European Toubon and the European challenge Toul during his 32-year career.
"This is a very special feeling," said the beating player in Southport.
"I could not defend my Extremadura Open title as it was taken off the competition calendar one year after my victory.
It is bizarre to come back to it.
This is an excellent place to play at golf.
I remember last year's memories, for me and for my wife Sharon, were a special victory for last year.
It was a very special time that we will always have in our hearts. "
Gary Orr will also return to the competition on home soil, who joined the European model of the geniuses at the beginning of this year when he received 50.
This is his first event in Scotland since the participation of Aberdeen asset Management Scottish Openil in 2013.
"It is always a little more meaningful to play at home," said Helensburgh's man Orr.
"They are good for the horns, but they are also very much more known.
I have enjoyed playing again enormously and I have shown quite a proper golf game.
I am satisfied with the progress that has been made. "
Trio will be joined by ian Woosnam, former MasterCard's market writer, and Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, mark James and mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder carika Captain Sam Torom are two out of six Scottish contests, the rest being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, bill Longmuir and ross Drumond.
Entry is free of charge, and car parking costs a passenger GBP 5 and a car with two or more passengers GBP 10.
All revenues will go to the Prostate Caner UK, a charity.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's gold-rich land
When Mr Degei's dinner is produced, he will not use lead.
He even rarely uses a boy.
In a house house in the capital of Papua Paniai Paniac province of Papua Paniac, Indonesia's tar will place a bar called the housewife in the local language directly in place of fire.
In half an hour's time, a breath will be taken from the fire in a daring sludge and stole with unscathless hands.
The Degei is sitting on a beautiful floor, it does not have interoperability and, at the same time, it is doing its daily household work there, for example, washing the washing with the water of nearby gender havoc.
The role of the baby is played by the uncovered room.
As she is a notary of four women of her husband, she has not been condemned to care for any generation.
Polygaamia is commonplace here on May.
However, the majority of men in the village may be at risk of being unemployed and many run heavily, plus soldiers.
'nobody dares to go around after 5 o'clock in the village 'says.
This is a rare cloud in Papua mäki, a former Dutch colony that was added to Indonesia in 1969 after the referendum that caused controversy, during which only 1 026 old people were forced to vote by taking their hands in front of their eyes.
The movement from the upper hand of the Dutch people towards their outrage against the Yakarta Government, which continues to keep the region under strong control, keeping away foreign journalists and human rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into a Pope and a Western Pope, so that independent Papua New Guinea remained in the east of the island.
To arrive here, 90 minutes from the capital of the province of Jayapurl must be flying within Nabin and then pass a five-hour journey to navel the rental car.
There is no public transport.
A city with around 19 000 inhabitants is made up of tree houses surrounded by breadcrumbs and covers ruminant iron roofs, which have been turned into a different tone into yellow lignite.
Very few indicators have taken the route here, not to mention the journalists, and almost no foreigners have been here either.
Prior to the arrival of Christian tanks, Mee Pago's pawns marched God by name ga Tamee.
Other changes also took place.
'We were not used to wearing such clothes, 'says Degei, referring to the coded turf of our paint voucher, the dark plumber and the private digestive.
'prior to that, we were wearing only plant cows in the body '.
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28% of people live below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy statistics are among the worst in Asia.
However, it is also a gold-rich country in Indonesia.
Just 100 km from Paniao, a mountain province of around 153 000 inhabitants in New Jersey, is the largest and most cost-effective gold mine in the world, Grasberg, a company based in Phoenix, Freport McMoran.
In 2015 alone, FFriday exports from here extracted around USD 3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can be proud of the supply of consumer timber with an estimated value of USD 78 billion.
However, these riches are the source of the suffering of the boats, as they cause the suffocating presence of a powerful Indonesia's army.
The New York Times study in 2005 showed that between 1998 and 2004, FFriday's report paid approximately USD 20 million to local military and military units, including up to USD 150 000 to one of the officers.
Pope's efforts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden hall and are handled ruthlessly.
According to human rights activists, more than 500 000 boats have been killed since 1969 and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesia army.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass killing of genocide in the 1970s in Papua tribal mountains was a measure of genocide.
Last year alone, more than 3 900 peaceful protestors were arrested by the Indonesia police in the area.
The 2016 Bishops' report 'We are all losing' contains testimony to the atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extra-judicial executions, torture (another report states that rape and electric shock are particularly common) and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims because such incidents occur every week," says the Indonesia researcher, Andreas Harson, of Human Rights Watch.
They have been closed down even more strongly, as Papua natural resources have led to the influx of new settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83% of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians, but demographics are changing because of the Muslim economic migrants coming from the islands of Jaava, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawes in Indonesia.
Direct peasants are selling gado-gado-gado with balcony and mixed vegetables, which are served along with peanuts.
The local authorities cannot compete with them.
"Migrants started selling chickens and vegetables more cheaply than local boats on the traditional market," explain the 24-year-old Lynne born in Paniai, who moved to Jayapuri, the province's capital for work.
"Black scars of indigenous people in Papua mama-mama [women] connect to lose their market share."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, who is known to be among the people as Jokow, pledged in his 2014 election campaign to address these inequalities and human rights violations in Pope.
The former pump won 27 constituencies, including Paniai, on his way to the presidential Palace of Jakarta in Papua 29.
But the Pope has changed very little and the local people feel deceived.
"Our hearts have been broken because, in 2014, we voted in favour of Jokow in the expectation that he would fulfil our hopes of restoring justice, 'Yes says.
In fact, only two months after Jokow took office in October, Paniai was in a low state.
On 7 December 2014, 11 children in the majority of the world staged on Christmas when two Indonesia soldiers appeared on a motorcycle out of darkness.
The intercepted children told them that they should include the front lights.
According to what the local pastori Yavedt Tusk said, one of the soldiers insulted their tone and returned afterwards with four soldiers.
According to the victims and spectators, soldiers under the influence of drink hunt hunted children and beaten them with their guns.
One of the soldiers then shot among the children.
One child, Yulianus Yeimo, aged 16, was beaten so courageously that he fell into the Chamber.
A few hours later, the nearby electoral Commission building was set on fire and things went on even further the next day.
Around 1 000 young men, women and children gathered in order to demand justice in front of the local police station and military control centre.
They carried breastous hunters and presented Papua mee pago tribe of waita-tanker, during which a round was drink-and-buried song.
Some protesters started to roll on the police and the military.
In the wake of the outcry of anger, an order was sent to the soldiers via a stadium: 'When the mass of the population is more than three times resisting, let them down,' was stated in an official document, which has been seen by the magazine on time but has not been issued to local media publications.
In the city of Kego Koto, the oldest Yeremias Kayam (56), the city of the majority city felt threatened danger and called for peace to be maintained by asking for the population to go home.
Nobody wanted to listen.
'When I was suddenly shot in the left, 'said to the magazine in his private colour on the verge of the tree.
We still do not know who the firmer was, but say that the month came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered.
'There was a lot of people, there were plenty of lasts in the industry, 'he adds.
Alfius Youw, a local man, has seen his shooting on three occasions, according to a needle.
"I would come to him and look through his body to make sure it is with him," said the magazine at length in Yohanes, who, like many economists, use only one name.
'I saw that he has died... I saw him '.
Papua police chief inspector Yotje Maks told reporters that he only guaranteed the security of his department because it was attacked.
"We need to protect ourselves when we are threatened with killing," said Pudjo Sulistiyo, Commissioner for Police Sulistiyo in 2015.
'This is a matter of life and death '.
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protestors were killed and there were many injured.
The news of the killings only reached Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokow Jayapura made a passionate speech expressing sympathy to the families of the victims and promising to deal with abuses in Pope.
"I want to resolve this case immediately so that it never happens again in the future," he said.
Mr Wiranto, Minister for Security, said in October 2016 that he would put in place an alternative mechanism for resolving crimes against human rights.
But the excuses almost immediately followed.
"Most crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to resolving these crimes, but we have to follow certain processes, 'he said.
Speaking at the time on 5 June in Jakartas, Wiranto, however, took his words back, saying that he had no intention of creating a Pope mechanism to deal with complaints.
Instead, he said, 'everything is done according to the law'.
Wiranto, accused by the UN of crimes against human rights, of deaths of more than 1 000 people in East Timor during the bloody referendum in 1999, said that 11 crimes against human rights had already been resolved in Pope, including in Paniai.
The families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with gloomy mistrust.
"I have been interrogated four times over the last three years, but there has been no progress," said Yohanes.
'I am tired '.
He says that years later, he still lives in fear.
'I am afraid, 'he says.
'I am afraid the army is arresting me, I am afraid I am being shot '.
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view that the Paniai people are afraid of smelting this incident.
He said that he had got a head from the army after helping to bury four victims.
'Even after burying the bodies, the army had to seek me, 'he says.
The arrests have not stopped.
On Tuesday in Deiyais, the people of Indonesia's village district of Paniai were shot by the police.
One person was killed and 17 injured, including children, when it went to war between the head of the village population and the head of the construction company, who refused to transport an unconscious man to hospital.
This man's people, the 24-year-old Rikuanus Douw, who drowned into a nearby river when trying to fish, died on his way to hospital.
The blind village people protested at the construction site at the office of the company.
According to the police, village people stoned policemen, the latter responded with warning bells.
However, according to local claims, mobile Britons (police deployed in Indonesia) started firing at the people, killing one person.
'We were in great panic, we are afraid of retaliation, 'said the 29-year-old Domingge Badii, who lives near hospital and saw the intake of the injured.
'I have beaten myself in my own house for two days'.
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the police involved to be held accountable and for the police to be withdrawn from the region by the mobile brigade.
Lead has always been a problem for the Government of Indonesia.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the dissatisfaction of the honey, mone, South and Sudanese tribes living in Papua halibut medium-mountainous lands.
Many of them have joined the Federative army of free Papua (VPL) rebels, which, according to its own words, protects the rights of boats by appalling attacks and kidnappings on the part of the Indonesia soldiers.
Some VPL leaders come from Paniao, including Tadius Yog and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, in recent years, under the pretext of 'defending state sovereignty', the army has been arresting in Paniai and arbitrarily arresting thousands of people.
Some of them will never appear again.
Paniades are known as' a tragic forgotten place 'among Papua people.
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
The low rice that is sold in the majority of the wheel is too expensive for local purchase.
I find the same unattainable.
People themselves grow their entire food online mainly on the basis of breadcrumbs, as well as some fruit and vegetables.
Farming is a job for women, each of whom can care for four or five baseline fields.
They usually keep most of the harvest in the family, the rest being sold on the local market.
Ten bates cost only 10 000 Indonesia's premises (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has been exacerbated between the indigenous boats and the new migrants, who have come a great deal since the opening of new routes at Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist are going to better educated and richer migrants.
The Pope himself often lacks the capital or the necessary skills to conduct a competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, President of the Paniai tribe Council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from the Pope.
In addition, strict restrictions remain on foreign media.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Pope because 'they did not follow relevant practices', even though they had been granted a rare film authorisation.
According to Pordm Kine, Deputy head of the Department of Asia for Human Rights Watch, the election promises made by Jokow have not been carried out to lift the restrictions on reports to promote transparency and development.
'In Indonesia, journalists trying to report in Papua most Eastern provinces and Western Pope, are threatened by new threats to the rejection of the interoperability visa and the listing of the black list, 'he said in his statement.
The lack of a look at the press means that international pressure on the government of Indonesia is largely limited to Papua ao's immediate neighbours.
In March, six of the Pacific States encouraged them to examine the 'United Nations Human Rights Council in Ukraine on a wide range of scale crimes', including the shooting of Paniao, along with Nauru, Belau, Tupain, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands.
These same countries have also historically supported VPL.
Arrmanatha Nasir, spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, dismissed the group's accusations, saying to the press in Jakartas: 'Democratic order still exists in Indonesia and freedom of the press, so that evidence of cases of human rights would be hard to bury'.
The local people want more foreign governments to be noted.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the country's human rights Envoy, Mr Van Bar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, the local people interrupted their silence, according to the source that they wanted to be anonymous, urging: 'We want freedom'.
In Indonesia, new presidential elections will take place in 2019, but boats do not believe they will vote for Jokow again.
Jokow is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in shooting at Paniai, says Hobai, President of the tribal Council.
He wants to tell Jokow not only that the people of Paniai live under the threat of a constantly predatory army, but they are struggling with misery due to poor education and health services.
According to Gobai, the people of Paniai, like other boats, regard their vote to Jokow as their debt to be paid.
'They do not need money, they want justice, 'he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai bombing managed to cope with the last symbolic revolt in front of the victim's body of police stations and the military bases responded to the land in question.
Knowing that justice may never be put on its feet, they will at least not allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
'One of our family members was killed, 'says the head of Yacobus who was felled.
'What else can we do? '
Come under the clouds of Dubai Torch for the second time!
On Friday, hundreds of inhabitants were forced to flee from this 337 meters desert and 79 tidal buildings through one of the world's highest residential towers in Dubai.
This is the second fire that has ravaged the High Representative for just two years, which happens to be called Turin, or Trusvikup.
No direct fire was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no direct fire was caused.
"We sleep and wake up to fires and people shouting.
We would be travelling down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor, 'said Reuters a resident who called himself George.
According to Dubai civil protection officials, fire-fighters also deleted the site at around 4 a.m. in the morning at local time (00.00 GMT) and refrained the building.
The government said that it was working to provide shelter to the victims.
This incident may once again raise questions about the safety of high-calibre materials used across the world.
An investigation carried out in the wake of the 2015 Tuch Management Board found that the most damage was caused by the façades of façades, the decorative panels and isolation of external soil.
The British police have said that they believe that the isolation of the London Grener Tower and the façade could contribute to the rapid spread of the fire that occurred there in June, killing around 80 people.
See: These phones are expected to become sales sites in the autumn
Complex and autumn is the time for technical Afghans to display their new models of excellence.
In the spring, Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia Premium came for sale, and in the autumn too, new hitt-phones are expected for boys.
"Thanks to the television 2 marketing and sale Director, CSjan Semother, this year's flagships are characterised by an innovative design, an eye-hall, a screen with 4K resolution on the server-servani, and a super-fast process manager.
In the technological world, Samsung Galaxy S8 has created a great deal of excitement, which has also reached the top of the sale table for smart phones in Estonia.
The autumn will allow even more tired recharging, more resilient battery, better quality cameras and greater water and pollination for smart citizens.
He added that the rumours were already able to speculate and predict four top-level models that will probably conquer the streets.
These four top models for smartphones will still be reached by the boxes in the autumn of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach the boys as early as mid-September.
There is a lot of growth in the rumours that the new Apple model looks at and what it can do.
While the iPhone 7 did not bring about significant differences along with the iPhone 6s, on the occasion of Apple's 10th birthday, it is expected that the new model will be completely different from previous ones.
Four paints have been mentioned: Black, white, rosé gold and chromium.
One of the elements of the new design is probably the screen, which covers the entire telephone headway, has lost the dog and the fingerprint readers have been built on the screen.
JonyIve, the head of design of Apple, is demanding that the new iPhone model look like a glass.
There has also been talk of an iPhone Ceramic version.
In addition to the horizon, the unmanageable recharge and a much higher quality camera can be expected to be faster than A11 processes.
Surely this is one year's most anticipated smartphones.
The outsourcing of the brand new model Galaxy rou8 begins on 23 August.
There have been many rumours about what the new Galaxy rou8 will look like.
I am hearing that even more business users have been targeted, and the S pen provides even greater functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one being a laissez-jerk and the other being television object with a narrower view.
No one knows yet what the two taboos can be, but in any case this is Samsung's first test, which is certainly comparable in terms of quality to that of iPhone 8.
However, we are looking forward to 23 August.
Although Nokia has brought three smart phones to sale this year, headed by Nokia 6, there is still a shortage of their flagships, Nokia 8, which are already to be presented on 16 August.
We expect a screen stretching from Nokian to 5.3 p.m. and an extremely rapid Qualcomm Skardragon 835 procedural processes and more durable battery.
Nokia also talks about aluminium corps and about a significant level of water and pollination in IP68.
Like Samsungi, the new model of Nokia has two taboos, an optimist produced by Zeiss.
If the flag vessel of Sony has been XZ Premium so far, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smart phones with even more innovative functions will soon be included.
We are waiting for a smartphone that is slightly more modest than XZ Premium, but at least just as good or better as a camera.
Regarding the new model of the Sony, there has been speculation that the screen is at least hot.
What reality will bring us to see very soon, as Sony has traditionally unveiled its autumn flag ship at IFA, the International Technology Fair, which is due to take place this year from 1 to 6 September.
Trump Mexico was pressurised for paying for the border wall, according to transcricers leaked telephone calls.
The Washington post unveiled transcriptions of telephone calls between US President Donald Trumpi and Mexican and Australian heads of state.
On 27 January, Trump's telephone call addressed to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop proclaiming that he did not intend to pay for the proposed border wall.
He was crushed by the American President for publicly condemning the Wall, saying: 'You must not say this to the press'.
Trump raised his presidential campaign's promise of building a long border wall and an age-old wall in the United States to make Mexico pay for this project.
It also published transcriptions of his first speech with the Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, which reveal an intense exchange of views.
Trump told Turn that the agreement by the United States of America to take in refugees to Australia was' ridiculous', 'nervous' and 'stupid'; he said that the agreement reached under the Obama Government would give him the impression of a 'guide', as he has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States.
The Trump concluded by informing the Turner that 'it was the day's most unpleasant speech'.
The state court did not prosecute the city of Liines, the city of OC MRP, for having rejected their offer for the procurement of bus services between July 2019 and 2029.
It is a letter of order rejecting the offer made by the city of Liines to the city of OC MRP at the Tartu bus service because the offer did not meet the requirements, An4 Aputin, President of the Tartu City Law Service, explained.
It is a procurement of public bus services within the city of Tartu for a period of 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
The city of Liines of MRP has taken a ruling before the Supreme Court of Justice of Tartu.
It was not prosecuted by the national court.
Although many in the social media complain that their night is disturbed by the Weekend festival and that the whole city is full of drunk brakes, there are also many who do not have any bad words about the ongoing festival on the floor.
I am even positively surprised that the supermarket had such a courtesy!
I did not see any misgivings or miscourtesy.
Even left, I saw a resounding wave.
"It's all very well to have come, to be and to be happy with the Persian Eagle, which is like the wagons of winter," he is happy to add.
The sleaning wave of rubbish does not bother.
While he still heard in a central town that music would be played on the beach, music has not yet reached his home intentional level.
"But I hope I hear, he says cheerfully.
The discussion in Agnes also shows that the Grand Festival is rather good for Persian, because it contributes greatly to the turnover of local merchants.
In addition, he welcomes the fact that the village has come to such an extent.
The woman of family meals has no difficulty.
Although I am no longer on the floor, it is nice that the beach has revived.
And it is good that the people are moving, and that has been the case three times now ', a woman says.
I think the first time was perhaps a little worse.
'Well, maybe there were complaints', he is wondering.
However, he said that what is happening on the beach was normal for the summer capital cities.
'This Weekend is a very good promo for our small city ', speaks of Harr on board.
Neither has Mhoever and möll spared his life.
But for you?
We should all make savings.
Think about how this inter-ethnic communication would be better.
The man of music is not daring.
It does not work, although I live near it.
'Good people can make savings and there is no misfortune ', he speaks.
Visitors who have arrived in Persian are polite, as he said.
"With bottles they have, of course, overtaken them a little, but young people are young and young God - give you a hand, but be people and do it! 'He says.
The coastal population has travelled somewhere by then, whether to relatives or acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival has a positive impact on life - people like this meal," Tiina, who speaks to children with Pernus.
His family's und festival is not bothered either, although last year it was even more so than this one.
Last summer there was another stage, then we heard more.
We live out of the city itself that it actually runs quite well off the coast of the Persian River. "
Pearson cuts another 3 000 jobs and reduces dividends to revitalise business
The British education company Pearson said on Friday that it would cut another 3 000 jobs and reduce its intermediate dividends by 72%, thereby launching another restructuring programme to deal with the threat to business.
The jobs to be protected, as John Fallon, the CEO said, will most likely be concentrated at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, will be added to the 4 000 posts lost during the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced plans in May to cut costs by another GBP 300 million (USD 394 million) under the third expenditure reduction programme in order to try to revive a business that has been hit by the transition to rapid digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell last month on its partner company Penguin Random House, Bertelsmann, said that their expectation of a year has not changed since a 1% increase in sales profits was announced in the first half of the year to GBP 2.05 billion.

Kabul: A suicide attack killed a NATO soldier
The suicide bomber, according to the officials, attacked military convoys in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and wounding several others.
The NATO statement said that five soldiers and interpreters were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were killed in an incident in the town's Qarabaghi square.
This bombing is the last of the acts of violence that have struck Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in the Herat mosque attack.
On Monday, two people were killed by a suicide bomber in Kabul, near the Iraqi Embassy.
The statement by NATO said that there was an explosion on Thursday evening when joint patrols with the Afghan army were attacked 'with a man-made explosive body'.
The statement states that everything is in a stable position and that it will be treated in a US military hospital on Bagram airport.
According to reports, the ever-growing forces in Qarabaghi, the Taliban and group known as the so-called Islamic State in Bagrai, are a source of serious concern to NATO forces in Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians have died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of whom nearly 20% in the capital city.
At the end of July, the car bomb in Kabul killed at least 30 people, mainly in the Shi'ite line.
According to the Taliban, they were behind the attack.
On 31 May, a major bomb attack killed more than 150 people in the centre of the city - the most deadly military attack in the country since the US-led forces rejected the Taliban in 2001.
This violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, while the President of the United States Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops helping the country's army and police.
According to reports from reports, suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public crisis of confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, its President, Ashraf Ghan.
The EPA subsequently annulled the decision to postpone the summer regulation.
The United States Environment Protection Agency (United States Environmental Protection Agency) annulled its decision to delay the introduction of a Obama regulation obliging states to limit emissions from the summer, one day after 15 states were brought to court due to this move.
The EPA announced the decision to proceed '2015 with procedures to determine the content of ozone' late on Wednesday, saying that it shows the Agency's commitment to cooperating with the states.
"We believe that we need to engage in dialogue and listen to our state partners," said Scott Pruitt, the head of the EPA.
Pruit was announced in June by the EPA's intention to postpone the ozone content levels in interoperability in order to measure pollution in various parts of the country in order to determine where this level should be reduced by one year until 2018 in order to meet the highest air quality standard.
The 15 main democratic states, together with the Colombian community, brought an action on Tuesday, saying that this decision was illegal.
President Donald Trumpi's government has tried to pull back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, which, according to the rumpire, are part of a more comprehensive plan for reviving economic growth.
However, these efforts have provoked reactions among the democrats and natural conservation groups who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health.
The EPA website states that breathing an air with ozone can 'reduce lung working capacity and increase the risk of respiratory diseases', for example asthma.
German pigs may come from a pipe.
German pigs and cattle may be caught because heavy rain jeopardises the catch of the second largest wheat producer in the European Union, Bisberg writes.
This year, it can be the case that weeks before harvest can mean that fruit intended for bread can only eat animals.
"The quality of the content is far worse than the soil and worse than in 2015," said the Agravis Raiffeisen analysts, Mr Raphard Sea.
This year, up to 40% of German wheat for animal feed, which is from food to normal, was forecast in Agrav.
German farmers, like their European colleagues, have come across all sorts of weather this year.
First of all, the winter was too dry.
Then came the spring, which was replaced by heatwave in June.
In July, Germany hit the German sails, which have continued in August.
Many eyes are on Northern Germany, where the rain hinders harvesting.
So far, only five per cent of wheat has been repeated.
Most of the region has not even reached the MSY level, announced by the buyer of the local harvest in Ceravis.
'That is quite a difficult day ', said Frank Deckert Rendsburg, a senior trader in Ceravis.
Consistency in everything, in other words, the sober rocks of internal design for Finns
In Kaunia, nature plays its part in the Internet nights, because through large windows the equated views of the Saimaa fishermen reach many of the rooms (life).
Every step in the face of the aspiration of our northern neighbours to create both strong and perfect (energy-saving) homes.
The ability to use the timber of Finns as construction and processing materials, furniture and beauty are also worthy of compliance.
Virtual techniques and smart solutions can be found in chambers, both in the construction and in the (home) designer.
It is clear there that the composition of black, white and grey chains, if they are supplemented by wood labels and food plants, can be very desperate.
There are still some good ideas open for a week to come, as the Fair will last until 13 August.
Suppliers and herbs suggest that this kitchen is often copied.
Today's drawing line is down to Weekend Festival Baltica and Martin Garriga has done his utmost to remember the latter as the last speaker.
The people were really turning around when Mr Garriga was present - the song, the song, the air, the dancing force.
When Garriga x ended, a single mass of Persian beach was spread over the city.
Let us bring you to the gallery, where you have all the pictures that tried on Weekl our photographer for three days together.
Certainly, you are also a few of them, you are looking for yourself!
Mainy Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mainy Garcia, who should be on the collision course to face up to the most attractive boxing category of boxing in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in Lomachenkot, at the office of the ESPN, in LOS Angeles, as long as Garcia, the unwon World Bodiplomatic Council's lightweights, walked to the other end of the corridor to welcome Lomachenkot, the World Bomainzationi sulgynch.
After the unanimous decision of Garcia, both combatants are at the forefront of the weighty table five following the victory of the former four-time world champions, Adrien Broner.
Ms Garcia extended her better hand and said, 'How does you go, champion?
I wish you every success. "
Lomachenko protects his belts against Miguel Marries on Saturday evening at 19 ESPN.
When a couple of photos were available, the Mayor of Lomachenko, Egis Climate, stated that there would be a 'perfect measurement' of the confrontation between the fighters.
"I am a former consultant," recalled by Garcia.
"I rise for Bronger [to 63.5 kg], but I am not so large.
I am small for 63.5 kg.
I want to move below the weight of relief.
And it must move up the weight of [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
Fans have asked for this.
Let us then offer them it. '
Lomachenko agreed.
'The boxing world needs this fight '.
(Es) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the climate raised the question of whether it should be cost-effective, as part of his strategy of allowing Lomachenkol to debate at the end of this year a class of 61.2 kg to make it possible for next summer to meet with Garcia (37-0, 30 noses), who also has an interest in combating Jorge Linarese and Luke Campbell's winner after their lightweight title in Forul on 23 September.
"Looking at this fight could be cost-effective, as fans have asked for this confrontation," said Garcia later, saying that he was open to fighting any channel that offers the best financial package.
"We are the main actors.
No other name can attract so much attention.
Whenever they are prepared... '
Garcia said that he considered Lomachenkot to be a 'powerful fighter' and could go on to see his match from Saturday to Saturday.
Lomachenko, however, was modest in praising Garcia when he said that he thought that the champion of the three divisuals from Riverside was' very slow; sorry, Mainy... you wanted this novels'.
According to Garcia, the aim was to show strength and then to pocket.
Both confirmed that they felt the increased tension between them in order to try to get there.
"This is a fight that we need to make a reality.
No other confrontation arouses so much attention and attention.
I am more than willing to work towards this, 'said Garcia.
Lomachenko said: 'I have been waiting for the best fighters, and Mainy has just been.
This will be a good fight. "
Which world corners are moving to Estonia?
Last year, the Police and Border Guard (PPA) granted a record number of over 13 000 residence permits to third-country nationals who have largely travelled to Estonia for work, study or family.
When, for example, a fixed-term residence permit was decided on last year for 6702 foreigners, this figure was 4928.
The services cannot tell how many immigrants will eventually remain permanently in Estonia, but such an analysis will be prepared in the Ministry of the Interior.
While nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia ten years ago, in recent years, the figure is close to 2 000.
The number of applicants for residence permits increased dramatically during the Ukrainian crisis, with 1087 fixed-term residence permits in 2014, up from 675 in 2014.
According to statistical data, the largest number of Ukrainian citizens is growing in Estonia, with 850 Ukrainian citizens arriving in Estonia last night more than leaving.
"The Ukrainian community has always been big in Estonia and, due to difficult circumstances, it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many families are already facing it," said Kristin Rammus, spokesman of the Ministry of Interior.
In total, the number of Ukrainians granted a fixed-term residence permit was higher than the number of Russian citizens, even though in 10 years, it is the latter who have had the most fixed-term residence permits issued.
When Ukrainians largely come to work here, Russian citizens for family migration.
'Given the historical Russian community here, they are also most likely to have the greatest family ties with people living in Russia ', said Helina Meing, an internal migratory theatre.
'If you look at where Russian citizens who have been granted a residence permit in Estonia have moved to, after Hartland, Eastern Viruony ', he added and pointed out that around 40% of them had married with a European Union citizen.
The soil received a fixed-term residence permit of 1696 Russian citizens, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wanted to extend their residence permit decreased.
"Compensation is the result of a new residence permit permanently intended for Estonia instead of extending its residence permit," said Rammus, spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior, who said that the interest of Russian citizens in Estonia's residence permit has remained stable for years.
The new residence permit for Estonia will allow foreigners who have lived here for at least three years to apply for it since last year.
Its aim is to encourage the sincere saving of people who have adapted.
However, a long-term resident permit requires, for example, five years.
The extension of the old residence permit has obviously also decreased because of the new residence permit.
Last night, for example, such residence permits were granted to Ukrainians, who have been working here for at least three years.
The Ukrainians can now change their jobs, and the Estonian state is no longer pointing the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met.
This residence permit became a lever - last year's applicants were holders of a grey passport (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Romanians (36).
In total, 1968 people were granted a residence permit to live in Estonia, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and as many Chinese, for example.
This first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
For 10 years, Nigeria has become, surprisingly, one of the most active citizens of the Estonian residence permit.
When three residence permits were issued to young people in 2007, the soil was 200.
Nigeria comes to learn from universities here.
Higher education institutions in Estonia are also popular with Georgians, Chinese and Turks, for example.
The number of citizens from India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen largely thanks to learning games.
For them, too, the rule is that where the community has arisen, there will be more easily to others, "Rammus added.
For 10 years, two people have also moved to Estonia from, for example, North Korea, just as much from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If around 6 000 third-country nationals receive a residence permit per year, that is about 0.46% of the total population.
Even if we add to the citizens of the European Union, migration remains about a percentage, "said Meuse that, in fact, the numbers were small.
In total, 14 822 people travelled to Estonia according to the statistical office, out of which 13 792.
This means that immigration has overtaken another year's emigration.
Most of those who are out and moving are Estonian citizens, but there are more of them leaving.
As a result, Estonian citizens' migratory bubble with 2 000 people was in decline.
Estonians, in particular, travel between Finland and Estonia.
The Prince of Mong Couture tricks with sats, chickens and sweet slope
In the Gulf of Northern ideas, however, there is a history for Maria Tampere - an old set of paintings and defendants: 'For hours, I can dream somewhere in a museum and admire old-age thieves and crats.
If you take a hard line, you will study it and learn it every day.
That is a joy of discovery!
The Mong Couture glamorous world may seem like a life-alien, but the designer does not think so.
You yourselves decide how much you have in your life!
As a friend, I have a whole saun full of my sharks of couture.
Because it is not his fault that he does not live in Hollywood and does not go to the red horse every day; he also wants to wear those most beautiful brothers, and that is what he is suffering!
You yourself can live your life special!
The Moeartist does not recognise the gap between shining events and bad day.
It was this reasoning that led to the rolling-out of the plan to bring the high-profile in Estonia between rural areas, forests and fields, to people who often do not reach.
For example, a collection of melong collections was presented in comparison, Jair and Perka moealleel, where the Royal decfiles with 45 models filled the entire street.
In Tallinn, you are often taken in in the shop, nodding with dignity, but elsewhere there are more emotions: Shouting bBravo, rising up; you want to thank you with compassion.
A large proportion of the audience had to be news just like that, but now they are the Mong Couture fans.
If you live up to the expectations of the people, they are overjoyed!
And I like the feeling that I am with my fashion at the summer recess.
Pernus had a 50-metre red carpet, full of rubbish along the street, seemed not to have come to an end!
Maria also does not recognise the motive that creation must be presented by a superstall; she will be happy to bring about ordinary women.
I often invite my own customers - they have always been happy.
This is the lax of experience, you have found the stage on a wonderful note!
I am so sorry that I myself have never seen my play; after all, I am always behind the shelf in order to give things the last button as a hopeless actionist.
My nerve would not allow a peaceful eye to be held on the floor.
Maria is the artist of this kind, who not only wants to play a representative role, but also to be present in everything.
I have my mesh machine on the radio, most of the collections being carried out myself.
I like the whole process where you played with details, find out.
I am never far removed from my nature and I am not afraid of work.
It is not a matter of isolation, nor is it a matter of style, logistics, organisation, organisation, organisation - it is all about the day of a woman who is wearing one of his or her corps.
For these hours of work, the fanatics are still doing a huge amount.
I cannot say when my working day will end, but for me it is simply a day of joy!
I am still very lucky - it is like an unceasing happy happy circle: I do something beautiful, man gets something beautiful and, in turn, compliments.
Several times, it has been said that my brothers have a natural treasure: They make themselves feel like a princess.
The generous, disgusting crucifixes that made Maria talent inaudible overnight have stayed until now in the form of Couture signals.
Martin Myrsep of U18 boys: The weapon of the Estonians' alagropium was now turned against us.
It is a shame, a fairy tale, that ran out.
The first thing that came to light was that we were not able to get our song on our desks.
And when there is such a big difference to be made on the table, "Estonia commented on U18 corvpallians 61: 75 abstentions for Britain's only Korvpallor, BC Kalev / Cramo abitreener Martin Myrsep.
Opponents took 28 balls out of the attack and, as a result, received so many more attacks.
Nor were we prepared for their aggressive defence or attack; it created it.
Many English attacks ended in three to five seconds; we were unable to build up protection.
However, in defence, they were able to keep their hands there, we could not combine them.
It got the team down its feet.
The homework of the opponents was better done.
The Myrsepa estimates that Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to take the opponent out in the bud.
In the last quarter, we had a zero error, but the opponents have already received several quick times.
Admirability and intense insistence, which was an alagroturf's weapon, have now turned against us all.
Today we did not have the strength to resist their aggressiveness.
Myrsep remained satisfied with his negligence in Kalevis, Matthias Tassi.
In general, tourism can say good words about the whole team; until now, there has been a single shock.
It is a pity that such an aggressive response had not been met before.
He has always been self-confident and played out today, but he seemed to have been tired - he has carried a great deal of burden.
But he made some quite beautiful moves, which I have seen in trends in the past, 'added the mentor.
Horrendous numbers: The Corvpallier of the kidneys in EM turf searched less than 10 points with three quarters...
In the U18 age classes, not only do the Corvpalliturniir of emi B-divisjon, in Tallinn, where she started in Dublin the day before yesterday.
And Estonia's game with Poland, unfortunately, was bitter in the area of antiquescorts.
Estonia lost 25: 65, but after a third quarter, the state of play was 9: 49, in other words, only in the last 10 minutes, opponents took their feet from the gas peat, with a delay of 16: 16.
In both the first and the second quarter, Estonia outlined 4, 1 points (3)...
In doing so, the Estonians initially caught two pieces of the first four of them in two minutes, and then two of them in 25 pieces of the game, then one in the troika and then another 21 visually...
Perhaps, for almost half an hour, one of the 47 stands was taboo.
In addition, 2 points came from four free tones.
The losses at that time were a reasonable figure of 12.
At the end of the game, Poland's hit hit 33% and Estonia had 13% (68 / 9).
Estonia has started to lose two, and Portugal's 83: 56 best had to be recognised on the opening day.
NATO vessels came to Tallinn to replenish stocks
Today, NATO's 1 permanent anti-personnel group arrived in Tallinn for the weekend on a planned port visit to improve ship stocks and prepare for the forthcoming exercise.
During the visit, vessels are preparing for a return to the sea, while allowing crew members to take pairant leave.
Following the visit, NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters to carry out a number of exercises and to be ready for future historical explosive operations.
"The participation of Lithuanians in NATO and the co-training they carry out in local waters is a good illustration of our integration with our allied forces," said the Commander of the Operation and Planning chain, the Commander of the navy fleet.
Since 29 June, NATO is leading the Latvian navy captain Gvido Laudups, who took over the tasks of the Commander at a ceremony in Riga from the Estonian navy officer Johan-Elias.
The group's flagship ship is set at LVNS Virsaitis, a Latvian naval support ship which also operates at the top of the group's star.
During this semester, the Estonian naval soldier, Mr Sakharov, will be part of the international unit.
As one of the four groups of vessels subject to NATO naval management, NATO is the 1 permanent anti-personnel group, which is part of the primary rapid reaction unit, which can be sent within five days to different parts of the world by the Alliance.
4. - Over 13 August, the ancient ruins of Pirita's monastery will once again become the place where Maestro Eri Kestival, called by Birgitta Festival 13 years ago, is being held down.
This year, Birgitta Festival, the artistic leader of Tallinn Film Film Joosti (36), says that it will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented.
At the risk of Joost: Cuba will find in the class of 'Travieta' and 'Tosca', balletilaresponses from the snomagic 'Bolerost' relay 'Karlssonin', and neither will there be a lack of self-sufficiency of the plan, this time by the wonderful orathy of Joseph Haydni's' Aastatime ', by the same international creative team that brought Pirilata Haydni even up a masterpiece of work' in 2015.
Birgitta Festival has much more than just concerts and theatres.
It is greater than any musical theatre in its normal form.
It is a festival whose snow is taking hold and is never going to be completely destroyed again.
Because the experience the listeners receive in this superior and mysterious environment makes human souls more generous and touches on human models in a way that cannot be described.
At risk, you are the first year of the art leader of Birgitta Festival.
Did the Maestro Eri Kans not feel like a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klaus, it has helped a lot.
She went to me throughout my student career and also supported me at the beginning of a dirigisme career.
Perhaps it is thanks to this that it will be easier for me to continue his work.
The team of Birgitta Festival has been sparked up so much in prosperity in various Klas and, of course, it will be passed on to me as well.
It was excellent to join the team, who knows exactly how things are going.
It was the great heart of Eri Klass that also gave me the strength to press ahead with the Festival in Tallinn's film harmony.
And here I am and I can!
What could the audience do at this year's festival, what are you offering in particular?
We have the first ballet written to Mrs Lindgren's story, from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, by the way, as a surprise.
It is' Karlsson flying '.
And there is a criminal nuance about the fact that the ballover author is the Latvian composer, Juris Karlson, who himself expressed a wish to write it into the works.
Obviously, she has had the Carlsson carater, who has lived with her breath since her child.
At the risk, how can you stick to all of this?
Thanks to my supporting partner, I am sure.
Such a job requires a support system and a lot of love, and fortunately I have a lot of love.
And I have noticed that my personal emotions do not depend on so many other people as I am perhaps going to oppose every new day.
And this awareness of tone, of maintaining positive tone and, in fact, of smiling in the mirror in the morning, has greatly increased my happy percentage.
Especially now this week, when there are the most important tests, I have been particularly keen on this and it is working.
To laugh itself is an accentuation of the brain and an increase in tone.
That is not just fine words.
I think that people do not yet know half the things about their own body that the universe offers them, but let everyone find them little by little.
Now is an important moment.
Do you also have some ritual before taking the dirigend wedding?
There are still clothing that has to be replaced with more convenient ones.
This is a small moment for itself.
But, overall, yes, I do not have the opportunity to pump or make a small flash before there is a lot of time.
In fact, I even like to engage actively with people, even before the dirigene is taken.
But come to Birgitta Festivalle, what can be discovered here, too, is not a particularly large opera and ballet friend!
Watch a video of mind with the risk to Yoostin!
New results of the age assessment tests for Swedish asylum seekers were published
In Sweden, asylum seekers were nominated for assessing their age-old medical approach, and the latest results of the test show that more than 80% of their constitutions were judged to be older than 18%, but not all believe in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute for Forensic medicine (Runtssatriinalverket) started with tests earlier this year.
The tests were set up to assess age more precisely during the application for asylum, after the Swedish Office for Migration (Migration) was criticised for failing to properly determine the age of a number of admittedly underage refugees.
To date, 6880 cases have been sent by Migration to the trial and the results of a total of 2481 tests have been published by the Institute of Justice between mid-March 2017 and 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) was estimated at the age of 18 or over, and in 25 other cases, the Institute of Forensic medicine estimated that the test was' perhaps 18 years old or older '.
In 432 cases, it was concluded that a person is' perhaps younger than 18 '.
Tests will only be used if people's age is in question.
According to Johan GöFrancson, who is working in the Institute of Justice, the results are consistent compared to those of the previous months.
"We do not see much difference from previous months' statistics; the figures are quite consistent," said The Local newspaper.
The fact that a large number of cases were judged to be older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied to their age.
In May, the Institute issued the 581 test results and said that, in 442 cases, 'there are indications that the person under investigation is 18 or more.'
However, when the results of these 581 tests were examined by Mrs Svensson Dagblaed, it turned out that in 243 cases the person had directly claimed that she would receive 18 this year.
This medical age assessment method, by carrying out smart X-ray pictures and by field classes MRT, has been criticised in some quarters, after which they are allowed to be analysed by dentists and radiologists.
One of the sceptics is Claude Marcus, the Institute of Karolinska's endochrinologist, whose tasks include assessing people's biodiversity maturity in order to determine whether they went through the public's normal audience sooner or later.
"I have had reason to think about this and I do not think that the measurement we are currently using should be used.
Setting biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we cannot say clearly, then we should not pretend to get, 'he said to Forest ro in his newspaper.
But Johan GöFrancson from the Institute of Forensic medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: 'Generally speaking, there is little risk of a child being left inaccurate.
The highest risk, at around 10%, is in the event of a person being slightly under 18. "

Mrs Maria Orel, a 20-year-old master, gave the London Mil a nice pot of debate by getting a good 18 with 67.37pm.
He then stated that MM's noorium was a female disposable, and a joyful woman confirmed that she hopes to fight for medals in the future.
The competition was successful and I had good experience.
I immediately took away my average result with the first test (64.80), the second (62.80) risk too much, and the third (67.37) was able to keep it clear "said Orel after the competition.
I was looking for my emissions and I am very pleased that I found them.
Mrs Oreli MM's debate ended with a good 18 places.
Vihmasadu Orelit was not confused because he is on strike through the LTTE stadium.
'I am afraid ', he said a little mute.
The London Olympic stadium had almost a full house of the people, did Orel regain people around it or were they able to turn off?
I have Mr Tajani, but in a positive sense.
Everyone says it adds - that is how it is!
If you compete on your own, you can experience it.
He then confirmed that he was satisfied with the debate on MM and that he had many other good competitions: 'I came here with the 32nd, the last result, I ended in 18th place.
This is a very good result.
I am 20 years old and I am a man - that is the only thing that matters.
I take away a good experience and, in some days, I want to compete on behalf of medals.
Western Virgina Governor announced party change
The Western Virginia Democrat governor, Jim Justice, announced at Thursday evening's meeting with President Trumpire that he would change political parties.
"Be that or not, the democrats walked away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today, I say to you, having said a lot of praises and thinking... today, I am telling you, the Western peasants, that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor."
There were rejoications at the gathering.
"So I will be Republican tomorrow," added Justice.
"As a engineer, I would say to you that it is time to play a different game."
A Trump had previously promised a major announcement at the meeting of Western Virginia.
Trump won the West Virginias with 42 points, and Justice did not support the Democrat candidate, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which is the only billionaire in the state, according to Forbesi, was elected in 2016.
In Forbe, it is owned by coal mines in five states and by the coal business in its own right.
It is worth around USD 1.59 billion.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee (RNC) issued an announcement on Thursday evening that 'the party change of Governor Justice is another blow to the democratic party that would prevent the country from improving again rather than working towards it'.
"Only 15 Governor Justice's announcement of the lowest number of states and control over his history is simply the most recent wake-up call to a party that is from the bottom to the bottom and cannot find a positive and united message," said RNC Chairwoman Ronna McMcDaniel's statement to CS Newsi.

Coe congratulated the Russians on their honest apology for the Doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, the international rhint of the Lighgean, said that he had 'Russia's four-day honest apology' for the Doping scandal, repeated that now is not the time to allow the country to reclaim sport.
At the eve of the lightweight World Cup, the Russian light Force, Dmitry Shylithtin, said at the Congress of IAAF, that the ban on competition imposed on his country was right and has a clear objective to combat doping.
He apologised 'to all the athletes who had been spared the golden and silver medals during the competition'.
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban on state-sponsored doping in Russia in November 2015, following the WADA report.
"I think that today was a very honest response, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to journalists.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian League itself acknowledged that they have had quite challenging times and that they would do everything they could to restructure the Union."
In addition, Coe said that he was delighted that Russia accepted the criteria for its own return.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is being made, but Congress supports the group's proposal that this is not the right time to withdraw Russia," said Coe.
"We must do everything we can in the next few months to normalise the situation.
We have always been guided by the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from a system that has been broken, "he added.
Eighteen Russian athletes who meet the strict criteria for IAAF will compete as neutral athletes at the World Cup in London starting on Friday.
The chair of the IAAF Group, Rune Andersson, said on Monday that Russia does not yet meet a number of sustainability criteria.
Following a presentation by the IAAF Council, he told the press in London that doping control was still inadequate and that the banned trainers were still operating freely.
The electric car revolution is dramatically changing the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Not only does the electric car revolution change everything from the fuel market to the infrastructure, it will also create new winners and losers on the metal market.
Although mining giants like Glencore can say that they will win from one place and lose out on the other, it will not help the smaller mining firms.
At present, Glencore coal and oil are serving, but future demand for cocats, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel is growing in the age of electric cars.
This year, governments in the UK, France and Norway have made contributions to the spread of electric cars, allowing the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be banned in the coming decades.
So Volvo has already been aware that they are planning to abandon the internal combustion engine, and Tesla is bringing cheaper staple 3 electric cars onto the market.
Bomberg New Energy Finance forecasts that over two decades now electric cars will be sold more than oil-fired cars.
"For some metals this will change everything," said the Capital Economics raw materials analyst Simona Gambranini Bisberg.
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as cocaine and lithium, the demand for which has been growing for years.
Electric cars have about three times more answers than the conventional car, according to Glencore.
More answers are needed at recharging stations, so Exane BNP Paris estimates that it will increase copper demand by around 5% by 2025.
An increase in demand for electric vehicle batteries means an additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphit and manganese.
The Glencore will generate revenues from the growing trend for electric cars from the copper price rises and from the fact that it is the world's largest producer of coscopes, the forecast for Jeffcoordinate Group.
This broker company estimates that FFriday report-McMoRan and First Quanma Minerals will be the winners of the electric car race.
The market is reacting to a changing trend.
This year, 70% of the London metal code has been burnt.
The rise in soil prices was 37%.
The left has also been spending 14% this year, mainly because of economic growth.
Glencore excise duty increased by 20% in London after exceeding the price level to rival Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo telecom.
On the side of the losers, lead companies such as Recyclex and Campine have to adapt to the new era.
The main end-use use of the gas is the batteries supplying the starch starters with the petrol and diesel engine.
Electric cars use lithium batteries.
"This is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found for other purposes to overcome the fall in demand," Michael Widmer, President of the American Merrill Lynch metal market, said.
The effect of the open-flow trend has not yet been noticed in the form of price movements.
Plii has risen by 17% this year, and this is the best metal in London, among the main industrial metals.
Investors will see problems for the metal only in the long term.
"I am not sure that lead will be so bad because cheap oil keeps ordinary cars competitive," said Herwig Schmidt, the venturer of Triland Metals.
If lead demand falls, it will be slow.
This may be the case in about ten years' time.
In the meantime, however, stricter emission standards mean an increase in demand for hybrid hybrid cars, which are dependent on the frequent introduction of engines from advanced lead-based batteries, will be assessed by the international lead and zoning research organisation.
Kergmetals such as aluminium replace steel, as a lighter car can drive further away with less electricity.
This can already explain an additional minimum demand of 1.6 million tonnes up to 2013-2016.
This represents 2.7% of the world's production of aluminium.
This trend is likely to increase, Mr Widmer said.
Aluminium has risen by 13% this year, as growing demand from car manufacturers has led to a market deficit.
Steel producers will not.
Ak Sway holding works with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce wonderful car chains.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Europe are also trying to develop a lighter meltdown from steel in order to counter the lower minimum.
'A strong steel should be the answer to this development ', said Exane BNP Paris analysis by Sylvain Brunet.
There is some progress in Europe.
The end of the oil era can also bring suffering to the plate.
The soil took around half of this precious diesel engine as catalysts for cars, announced by the metal refiner Johnson Matthey.
"Many raw materials with a high demand today, such as oil and poster, may not face a high demand in the future," said Bernard Dahdah, the Natix raw materials analyst.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important, but their importance will change over 15 years.
The plan manufacturers believe in continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Marc Grynberg, leader of Uncore, said that in 2025 more hybrid cars will continue to be sold as hybrid cars.
In the 10-year perspective, the great hope among the planned producers is of the hydrogen-based cars developed by Toyota Motors and Hyire Motos, which depend on the platinum to produce power from hydrogen.
So far, however, this technology has not yet commercial justified itself.
"Dialogue seems to be a clear losers on the road to electric cars," said Exane BNP from Paris to Brunet.
German car manufacturers suffered a major setback in July, as the court in Stuttgart banned diesel in the home town of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How do the financial rules for football affect Neymari's transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the unbridled spending of European football clubs do not prevent the record transfer of the Neyra World Expo from Spain to the French club Paris-Saint Germain from going to Barcelona.
Any consequences for UEFA, the governing body that dominates the European game and is in a position to prevent teams from participating in the prestigious League of Ministers' turf, await the Paris Paris Saint-GerMain.
The financial rules for fair play introduced by UEFA in 2011 (FFFP) mean that PSG will have to demonstrate at some point that the Neymar transition was financed without huge losses.
Barcelona was paid EUR 222 million (USD 262 million) for the sole purpose of buying out its treaty and Neymari's salary will reach tens of millions of dollars per year.
There are some financial aspects of Neymar's transfer to the French club.
PSG will no doubt be able to come up with such money to recruit Neyra and put its stars on the map, given that the team will be funded by the family governing the Katar Energy bill.
Clubs are allowed to spend a great deal of money in recruiting players, but they have to balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to get out of football.
The FFFP was set up by Michel Platini after his election as President of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs in search of success are actually engaging in fraud and risking ruin if banks or owners were to give up subsidies.
From 2011, rather than debt for FFP clubs, the focus will be on monitoring these losses.
This change means that the business model used by Roman Abramovich first in 2003 in Chelsea - to buy a club with potential and then to spend a great deal in order to improve the team and create a global brand - is more difficult to implement.
During the current three-year evaluation period for the FFFP, which runs until 2018, clubs can bear losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And even though Platini was shamelessly excluded from the presidential office in 2015, his successor, Alexander Ceferin, remains committed to preventing excessive spending.
"FFP is certainly not dead and we will no doubt continue to strengthen these rules," said The associated Prinle Andrea Traverso last week, UEFA-s FFFP's watchdog.
Although PSG pay for the Neymar over-purchase clause as a single full payout, they will be able to distribute this amount for accounting purposes throughout the period of validity of the agreement.
Neymar concluded a five-year agreement, which makes it possible to demonstrate a transitional fee of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years.
On the occasion of the first wave of sanctions for the FFFP in 2014, PSG, together with Manchester Cityi, a member of Abu Dhabi, suffered the most severe penalties.
A fine of EUR 60 million (currently EUR 82 million) was imposed on the PSG, which was later reduced to EUR 20 million, and a club was called on to limit the League of Meisters' team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season instead of normal 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to cross-select financial regulators by inflating their incomes through companies associated with the owners of the club.
Although a company of Qatar may sponsor PSG, if the value of sponsorship were considered to be above standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be taken into account as an official income.
This was the case in 2014 when UEFA decided that Qatar Tourism Authority (PSG) value was inflated.
It has been said that certain parts of the Neymari PSG service may come from contributions to Qatar by the 20-22 World Cup Management Committee.
However, PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neyra could become a member of the World Cup and claim that UEFA's regulatory authorities can easily uncover such a manoeuvre.
The penalties previously imposed on the PSG mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant in any attempt to circumvent the rules.
People who were familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed the transition proactively with PSG Neymari.
They talked to The associated Congress, provided that their anonymity is guaranteed, as they are not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest reports show that the PSG will make profits of more than €10 million over the 2015-2016 season at around €542.4 million.
Data from the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that the arrival of Neyra will have a positive impact on sponsorship transactions, commercialisation and brand sales.
The club is looking forward to an increase of at least 30% in relation to the conclusion of the contract.
Spain too, clearly annoyed by the departure of one of the largest football stars, tried to prevent the Neymari transition by claiming that the PSG was in breach of FFP.
This is a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and state, 'said to the Spanish newspaper, Javier Tebas, with President La Tebas, indicating that PSG is mainly owned by Qatar.
Arsenal mountain junger ArconneWenger, who belongs to an American sporting magnet, shares with La li the attitude of state funding for the club.
"This is a consequence of property rights and has changed the entire football landscape completely over the past 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"When a club belongs to a state, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play, as the country can have other ways or other interests to make such a big player represent the country. "
The Norwegian low-cost airline interoperability has a nice tradition of putting on aircraft aircraft the pictures of those who have moved borders in their own area and have been an inspiration to others, writes trip.ee.
Along with the expansion of the scope of interoperability, the circle of people who earned their place on aircraft has also expanded.

Today 50 years ago: An unrivalled storm in Estonia, which ripped off houses with roofs and windows.
The storm-renamed hurricane that raged on 6 and 7 August caused serious damage, particularly to the Baltic States, Hartland and Raplamas.
In north-west Estonia, during these days, the wind was over 30 m / s.
My old metal ran from one card tree to another and covered with orders to support them.
All was blind and depressing, like a world lesson.
The mother has already flying from the house roofs, in 2002 the old Mrs Linda Kurova Haapcus reminiscent of a magazine in an interview with the Estonian natural world.
The husband of Linda saw the treasure he planted collapsed.
But what sort of rubbish do you have your hands on, where are you going against such a storm?
The sea came under the window, from windows priced in water ', Mrs Linda tona, who was on the streets of Haapsalus Kalda, spoke.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and the roof of the railway station had flown 20-30 metres away saw Linda most of the weddings as they did just next morning.
According to local authorities, behind Paralepa, trees were lying behind the foam, some are absolutely long, some are boys.
Everyone saw a very depressing storm, a storm raging through hundreds of old trees and pragmatism like war.
Western Virulands were not particularly hard hit by August 1967 compared to Western Estonia, but the losses were also huge there, the Official Journal of Viruony in 2007.
The Haapsalu Lfossil park and the Padise Park were swept from the ground, but our monks were also severely affected.
In Tallinn, the wind was measured at a speed of up to 35 metres per second, that is to say, approximately 130 km per hour.
In Tallinn, Meriel, on the evening of 6.August, one of the tears of lead had shouted: 'Mother, mother!
The chickens are in the air and can no longer be signed! ', the Official Journal of ViruCountry has written.
The generation's term building in Viljanore was destroyed so much by the storm that it was decided to be dismantled at a later date.
The design of Tür's ski mountains did not stand up to the August storm, which was later not restored.
On 12 August 1967, the newspaper Red Taet wrote that the urbanisation of towns and settlements from landlocked trees and their oxygen is progressing slowly, and that the population could be involved in cleaning work.
Fruit fields were also severely affected by the storm, and the newspaper stated that 'party-to-party organisations must be an incentive and direction for both cleaning and fertile harvests'.
They can be discussed in cases where average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m / s.
The net wind record in Estonia will remain in place from 2 November 1969, when Ruhent measured the wind as a matter of urgency at 48 m / s.
The Vonly story on the island broke the sword, so the high speed of the wind measured there could not be accurately recorded.
Secret of old bathing areas: Night-to-night cleaning and poor coastal weather
Cold summer bells also mean less duplication in the ski areas of Tallinn.
'If it is not, people are on the beach and, if not, there are no people ', it is the corder who says the floor.
In the Stroom beach of Northern Tallinn, shales are preoccupied.
They are offered by a tractor running at low turnaround turns of mechanical competition, which is plundering the platitudes.
In fact, the latter saves seven centimetres deep through the sand, clearing off marine litter and the risk left out of it by people: Bottles, cigarette factories and so on.
People still come to rank, regardless of whether the water is warm or not.
If it is beautiful, people are on the beach and, if not, there are no people, 'the management of the company Haaber says Alexander r Usov, head of the maintenance work on the floor.
At 6.30 p.m., there is bitter cleaning on the beach, because at 8 p.m. the poster must be in order for the people.
The job is already on track at four o'clock.
Apart from Stroom, he is still keeping an eye on Pirita, Lake Harvel, Kakup and Paleriaare Pikakari.
Landfills have been reduced.
Years ago, it was much more.
People now know how to assess what is being done for them ', Usov, who has picked the shoes for 15 years, speaks.
It was previously the case that, when something new was put on the table, it was broken next day.
Now what the beach is kept on.
Price of clean beach
One of the biggest jobs on Estonian shores is the clearing of marine rubbish, known as adru, on the shore.
For example, on the surface of Pirita, it must be transported to 400 000 tonnes during the coastal season.
'This is an unbelievable amount, 'notes Usov.
The second large category is municipal rubbish, or everything that people leave behind themselves.
At a one and a half kilometres on the Stroom coast, there are eight large waste-seine units which need to be emptied three times a week.
That is how much rubbish is generated.
However, the cold summer weather has meant that the waste is one fifth less than otherwise.
The third species is deserted objects.
These are mostly cargo journeys.
This time, Usov has pulled out of the sand inside ten metres of the sludge.
They will wait for the owners to beset the timber route.
'normally more people come out of them, but that is a normal harvest ', which already knows that it will soon find them back in the sand.
Children come to beach and take toys to plant them in the sand again.
Prüm is being torn up
Erika Scholler, the representative of the administrative services, admits that the tractor's screening work is disrupting local communities.
Noise, which runs from night to night, interferes with the adjacent population.
However, that work is impossible on a day-to-day basis.
In one month, you get a war twice over.
'If we do not, we will be fined by the city section ', Scholler will note.
However, like Pirita, Pikkar and Persian, the aim is to get Stroom rand down to the international Seal quality mark.
"There is much more work in Estonia to ensure that beaches are maintained than in Europe," says Scholler.
We have more adolescence and stone and it is more difficult to drive in the sand.
What we have on our beaches is less rubbish than elsewhere in Europe.
When you hear that a beach talks about rubbish, Martin is moving around uncompulsorily near Stroom beach's interviews, highlighting the current weaknesses on the floor.
Homo is a picture everywhere in the gallery.
The problem is birds and net slaves, who have pulled rubbish bags in the first place, "Martin declares.
Although it is difficult to assume that people can change their behaviour to date, Martin hopes that the urban government will do something about the waste bin chains and impose on them, for example, the cameras, in order to prevent them, at least on the birds, from finding themselves in the news there.
In general, however, Martin's beach is satisfied with the development.
We can see that the city is taking care of this.
It has become more pleasant with children's squares, enlightened and fresh asphoned roads.
It used to be the case that you could only travel one way on a case-by-case basis, "says Martin.
Aardetote bread in Stroom: Coins, only coins
A 40-year-old Dimitri, who, as a treasure village, is cutting off the coastline with a metal-engine, has had to be used for a tomorrow's measurement period.
He does not believe that, today or in the future, he will find anything precious.
Marine God is not generous enough.
'I have been working on this for a year and have so far found nothing valuable ', says Dmitry.
As a reservoir, the Dmitry Treasure Dmitry is a few euro coins, pumps and also a dangerous pound that will subsequently be thrown in the bin.
It is usually the coins.
'Well, the finger and so on are usually not ', they are a treasure village.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain at their level, as weak growth and the easing of inflation have softened speculation about the increase.
Bank of England has warned that growth will remain sluggish because households' hard-pressed incomes have put interest rates on hold.
Policy makers in the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted for a 6: 2% retention and fewer members will be demanding an increase this month, as slow economic growth has weakened support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and 2018 to 1.6% and warned that the pressure on household incomes would persist, as inflation is still expected to rise close to 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the Bank also signalled that the increase in rates will be necessary to contain inflation over the next few years due to Brex, and the financial markets may require an expected increase in credit costs.
The Members also voted a year ago in favour of a partial withdrawal of the mammoth package, which was introduced as a result of Brex.
In February, the Bank will terminate the fixed-term financing scheme, which provides cheap funding to the banks, even though it said that it is now expected to make an increase of GBP 15 billion under this scheme, which is GBP 115 billion.
In the minutes of the decision on the rate, the Bank says: 'Gross domestic product (GDP) will remain powerless in the near future as the difficult situation of real household incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption'.
As regards rates, it was reiterated that, in order to mitigate inflation, 'fiscal policy making a little effort' was needed, to a 'somewhat higher degree' than was expected on the markets.
Mr Böge is now forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second one in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any hype is gradual and limited.
The Bank's reduced growth projections for this year and next year are comparable to 1.9% and 1.7% in May.
The forecast of 1.8% growth in 2018 remained unchanged.
After that news, the pound went down against the dollar and the euro.
Nael fell by 0.5% to 1.31 dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euro.
The decision not to make any changes is due to recent disappointing growth figures, which have dampened the growing hopes of a rise in intellectual GDP in the second quarter, at 0.2% in the previous three months, to 0.3%.
The Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will pick up slightly by the end of the year.
The Bank's latest inflation report gave little reason to rejoice with rising inflation and miserable households suffering from wage increases by saying that the situation will get even worse before improving.
It was added that the monetary policy cannot prevent an income blow in the next few years, but a marked recovery in wages is expected towards the end of a three-year forecast.
Due to the nail pound, the economy is also stimulated by the growing demand for British produce, which is partly rewarding lower costs for consumers.
The decision comes one year after the rates were taken last August at 0.25% after the shocking EU referendum, which caused the pound to collapse.
The Bank estimates that it is likely to take four years to breathe full life into prices and the economy.
Before the Bank's final decision, the growing demand for raising the rate was felt, as inflation had increased the pressure on hard-pressed households; in July, three policy makers called for an increase of 0.5%.
Inflation fell by 2.6% last month, compared to 2.9% in June, although the bank said it was expected to rise again in the coming months.
The Bank said that excessive growth compared to the 2% target was entirely due to the weak pound.
The head of Coreco mortgage brokers, Andrew Montlake, said: 'In the light of the recent downturn in exchange rates, it seems that the mortgage market will become increasingly competitive again, as creditors will want to work and look forward to concluding the year positively.
Eurostars seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are coming to an end, since refinancing, often without earning and at low rates, has become increasingly popular. "
NHS written 10 000 HIV drugs for controversial people
Since September, patients have had access to 'transformative' HIV-preventive treatment after a battle waged in a Supreme Court over whether the NHS should finance the medicine.
NHS England has announced that public health care is now estimated to make available to 10 000 people in the initial three-year clinical trial before the exposure to prophylactic (PrEP) - a tablet that is manned before mid-term and which has shown a reduction in the risk of infection for high-risk people by around 86%.
The NHS agreed to fund a clinical attempt after the Court of appeal supported last year's Supreme Court ruling that the NHS would be able to pay for PrEP, despite the institution's own claims that the medicine should be financed by local authorities.
Simon Stecrates, CEO of the NHS England, welcomed the launch unveiled on Thursday as' new far-reaching intervention ', while the National AIDS Fund (NAT) described it as a' landmark moment '.
Sexual health clinics in London, Bright ton, Manchester, Liverpol and Sheffield are among the first to register people, and in October there will be more clinics before the programme is put in place everywhere in England by April 2018.
Cinderella prophylactic (PrEP) is a display of HIV drugs before the recess to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Clinical trials show that the PrEP significantly reduces transmission of HIV to people at risk of infection.
The introduction of the PrEP before the recess means that there are enough medicines in the body of the human being that prevent HIV from being infected.
Such medicines can be taken every day, or at the latest two hours before the recess.
Among the successful candidates are lesbian or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and cannot be treated.
Clinics are identified by suitable people willing to participate in clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV-related partner cannot receive antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there can also register their wish to participate in the local sexual health clinics participating in the programme.
The programme costs GBP 10 million and NHS England signed an agreement to obtain medicines this week following an international procurement procedure.
The purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the real potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence of who the medicine is intended for and how it is consumed and implemented in a large picture.
Stecrates said: 'This new massive intervention should complement and intensify the wide-ranging and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of fighting one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity. "
Deborah gold, CEO of NAT, said, 'This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
The PrEP, if it is properly targeted at those who need it and are at risk, will offer an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people with high risk of HIV in England, through this clinical trial funded by the NHS, have had access to a powerful new tool that is individually managed and does not depend on negotiations with the partner, thereby improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. "
Ian Green, the CEO of the Terrence Higgins Fund, said: 'Now it is a priority to ensure that the clinical trial is carried out quickly across the country and that no member of the HIV risk group is left behind.
Now that the PrEP clinical trial has been obtained, we are on the way to protecting more than 10 000 people who are at risk of being infected with HIV.
The Minister for Public Health, Sharon Hodgson, said: 'The start of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and long overdue following months of delay and government tearing its feet.
Evidence shows how much change this medicine can make to HIV prevention and to stop the spread of this life-changing infection.
This clinical test takes us one step closer to a full understanding of the PrEP's advantages.
Now it is important that the clinical trial is taken over as soon as possible to protect people who have contact with HIV and to bring us one step closer to halting the spread of HIV in society. "
Electricity prices have risen by 12% in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
In July, the difference in electricity stock exchange between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania next day decreased to EUR 1.94, compared to EUR 7.71 in June this year, announced Elering.
The main cause of the price difference is the richness of the Lithuanian-Swedish Community.
In Estonia, the average price for electricity exchanges last month was EUR 34.33 per hour, and the price rose by 12% compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by 5% to EUR 36.27 per megaphone hour.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34.17 and the system price of the electricity stock exchange north was EUR 26.37 per megaphone hour.
Prices rose by 12 and 7% respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, electricity moved 75% of last month's hours towards Estonia and 16% of hours from Estonia to Finland.
The remaining nine% of hours between the two countries did not carry out the next day's transactions.
Estonia and Latvia moved 99% of the time from Estonia to Latvia and 73% of the hours used the full transmission capacity.
On the Nasdaq OMX market, which took place on the last trading day in July, the price of the electricity stock exchange can be around EUR 34 and EUR 37 per hour in September.
Carbon prices affecting the electricity production price increased last month and transactions took place at a price of between EUR 5.04 and EUR 5.47 per tonne.
High life - half-decrees and smart designers have made it home to a small Earls Court room
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate property innovator, changed his great home of Knightsbridge to the Earls Court flat in 2014.
It is on the first floor of Queen Anne Terinteroperability, and the fact that Joanne has not packed her bags and sold it over is a tribute to the new design.
"Before that, I lived on much larger soil with my former life partner in Knightsbridge," said Joanne.
"I looked for something that would be the equivalent of the price I offered.
I was told that Earls Court flat and had the same high warehouses.
I loved it and made an offer the same day. "
Since its first visit, this 93-square metre flat has gone through a complete innovator.
At the beginning, it was a sleeping room and a complicated flat: In order to get a sleep, you had to walk through a kitchen, and Joanne wanted to include savings and half order in order to exploit high-quality discoveries.
"I wanted high-profile, big windows, a lot of light.
These were my demands, 'he said.
He asked Erfan Azadi Notting from the architectural and designer radio Duck & D to take advantage of the 3.8 m desert and create a home, which would be not just a development object, but a place where Joanne could live.
It was not high enough to add two areas to each other, so the architectural challenge was to create half-order where you could stand.
Mr fan had to take a creative approach.
"Construction is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to restructure the rooms so that they were on each other without having to bow down.
It was not just about building a platform, but about using steel construction to make it right for the upper and lower margins to be built. "
This positioning made it possible for Mr Erfano to create two beans in the room with full height with a lot of dramatic elements.
The penal age is opening up with the new light from the Retrouvius window to glamorous housing under the guise.
A golden furniture, silver details and retrospective Serge Mouille's light highlight space style.
The use of mirrors plays a role in the inclusion of theatre, space and lighting.
Mirrors have been added to both sides of the short corridor to appear longer.
In the night I am giving the impression of a second window with mirror.
During their introduction, a mirror retention site will be available to all garments and glass requirements of Joanne.
The possibility of closing down vegetables if it is not used adds to housing, creating a more glamorous space.
According kitchen cures are nothing new.
However, what is unique in this kitchen is the fact that it is a sort of uprising in the garage.
'It took a bit of design work in this regard 'explains the case of the MDF, which has been spoiled with a steel strengthening.
'This has a counterweight and therefore unites very simply to reject it '.
Thanks to the smart use of space and savings buildings, Joanne now has 16 extra metres, an additional bedroom and a better flax plan.
"After all, flooring is what you sell - or what gives value to property - 'says Erfan'.
'The anchor's rock takes an outdated ashes and makes calculations based on the underground area '.
Here they have been able to increase the floor floor, using high-quality materials to add luxury to space.
"Materials are what you are dealing with and thus help to bring about an emotional link with your homes," says Erfan.
'You do not love electricity cable in the wall.
It is important, but it does not call heart languages. "
This shows that good design and increased area are helping to make something quite amazing about the usual corps.
In fact, they may even give rise to a desire not to leave, as happened with Joanne.
Chief figure, Sir Jensen, is a keystone running in Chicago's cloud-based village, which is in competition with a colleague for professional resentment.
There is no other than the amount of money that is earned, with which any ethics is forgotten.
A man of her wife and her three children can only see her husband in a thief and late night.
In the first half of the film, I deem myself thinking that this is the 'House of Commons' version of the business world - even Kevin Spacks and Gerard Butler's speech maneer are similar.
However, the more film goes on, the less hardware element remains, and the moralising intention of film-makers is becoming increasingly apparent.
Life-changing experience will mean that the main figure will be cancer in the boy.
The choice now has to be made between work and family life.
The despicable son makes the father think in his walking visits to Chicago's major buildings about things that are really important, such as religion, prosperity, love..., without even touching on the disaster of the twin sectors.
After the third poem, where the son opens his eyes, there is a feeling that the film-makers have been guided by the aim of being able to lecture the audience, because even the visitor of the most basic conscience is unable to hold back tears in view of the suffering of a lovely cancer-sick boy.
When the son falls into the bag and his situation looks almost hopeless, the father understands once and for all the morals of his work and compares his work to the old man seeking charity.
Now I am taking a layer with myself: If a film has a link, I will reward my insight after a film's coffee, if I am wrong, I may be commended for at least one surprise.
For a moment, there is a suspicion that a baby will be deprived of a seat, when the husband will call a hospital and the man will rush to the neck of a corridor in slow motion.
The boy has, after all, been miraculously healthy, and even though his father has just lost his job, it is also proving to be positive, because now is the time to deal with the family.
I, too, feel comfortable - I can already predict the end of the American drama quite well!
In truth, the film is well designed; all the elements are there.
You can take the button, you can laugh, the actors are a good, moral beauty: Money is not the most important thing in life.
I am surprised that the film is coming in well.
The new staff Commander intends to limit the President's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Perhaps Mr Kelly will actually manage it.
He would then be the first one.
Politico writes that the new staff commander of the White House intends to limit President Trumpin's flow of information, including news, in the hope that this will keep the excess in excess of water.
Here is a full report from Josh Dawseyt:
'When the new head of staff of the White House, John F. Kelly, met with high officials on his first day of his work, he pointed out the key problem facing President Donald Trumpi in the White House, which he plans to resolve through the transfer of disinformation into the President's hands.
Kelly told officials that the information must go through him, whether on paper or in meetings, because the President would take better decisions if he were given good information. "
Kelly's diagnosis seems perfectly logical, but others have tried it too, and they have failed to monitor Trup's media consumption.
President Trup's relationship with television goes back decades and, even now that he is in the White House, his television watching habits have gone nowhere.
'If the candidate, Mr Trump, was annoyed to show him that he had been fairly reflected in the prestigious publications' said the former campaigner, Sam Nunberg, in February, to Politico.
Politico fence Palmer wrote at the time that 'six former campaigners say that Trumpi Twitter driving is key to ensuring that his own private media consumption includes a stable song of praise'.
Very well.
But the idea that Trumpi Twitter's used habits have ever been 'controlled' is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaigners know something that the rest of us do not know about the costs of interoperability Trumpire would have been even more heartening without their interventions.
We will probably never know about the charges that were not passed on by Trump.
When his helpless managed to save him even a few times the trouble, his efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to prevent Trumpire from continually stirring up controversy.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which is made up of competing clicks, people are trying, without exception, to promote their own interests by transferring material to the Olympic Games that supports their views on the world stage but may not always be credible.
Politico, which reflects the whole development of the story, wrote strategically questionable information from the advisers' leanings to the President of feed in May.
One example, described by Mrs Goldmacher, is the following:
"The present and former Trumpers are saying that Trump can react to a negative press, particularly with damaging effects on leaflets, exploding the idea of finding their source of origin.
This was also the case at the end of February, when someone happily gave a copy of an Internet provocator printed by the President, Charles C. The Johnson website of GotNews.Net, a deputising depuder of staff, Katie Walshi, accused of being the 'source of several leaks' in the White House.
It does not matter that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of mocking, or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he has made false accusations and withdrawn them in the past.
The Trump read the article and started asking about Wales, who was subject to it. "
Goldmacher added that Rob Porter, the then head of staff officer Reince Priebus and head of the White House office, had tried to put in place a system to manage and document documents reaching Trumpin. "
How did it work?
Mr Kelly is trying to do exactly the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader, but Trump will still be an impulse and will continue to compete for influence.
These unchanging factors make the Kelly mission very difficult.
Street musicians who come from abroad will not get permission to speak.
In the centre of Tallinn, there is a lot of foreigners taking place.
Those with whom the conspiracy had spoken acknowledged that it was playing in the old town without the permission of the city's administration.
The first were three street musicians who had taken the same number with them from the virtual gates.
It was clear that musicians with rhythms and fractured riches were behind-the-scenes, to whom one shoch would be spent.
Despite the violence, the only woman in the company played a ruthless rhythm in acordion, while one man, next to her three balls, called the furniture closer.
The third man was sitting next to a house in absentia and smoked a warmer self-prepared agglomerations.
Their three chambers did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the passing people.
Bob, who played with Acordion, spoke with Noemi and Palace, about being patronising in the streets for both fun and money.
The purpose of the exercise was to collect ticket charges for a ship travelling to Finland the same day in the evening.
The question as to whether they were asking for permission in the old city in order to muscle was shaking Noemi and Bob's head.
Firstly, we did not know.
Secondly, we will never stand in one city for more than a day or a few, and most of them will be granted permits for a month or something like that.
There is no point paying for this, 'explained Bob.
When we got back to the Viru gates about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women are at musicians and are driving them away.
The exhibition with the bailouts and the dogs of the Viru Centre came to the test of happiness.
There were also three Polish young men on the Viru street, one of whom played sign, the other was chlaring, and the third had even carried an electronic glass.
"We are here to give people a feeling of entertainment to spread music and joy and to earn money for fuel and living," explained the trio from the pipe Mivosh.
According to Mivoshi, they are aware that the city authorities must be allowed to speak.
'We do not have it of course ', he said so joking.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there will be no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we go elsewhere but have to try ', he added.
In July, the Estonian Central Bank purchased EUR 149 million in bonds under a public asset buying programme of central banks in the euro area, and the Central Bank bond portfolio increased to a total of EUR 4.36 billion.
The Central Bank does not publish more detailed information on purchases.
Hardo Hansson, President of the Bank of Estonia, has previously explained, in response to a request from members of the National Assembly, that the plan for the assets of the central banks of the Eurosystem includes three different purchasing programmes: Covered bonds (interoperability), asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public bonds (PSPP).
The Central Bank is buying up bonds on the market in order to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere.
Purchases have an impact on lower-risk asset productivity and encourage investors to take bigger risks.
As a rule, in the framework of the public bond purchasing programme, each central bank buys its government bonds, while other government bonds are not purchased.
As the Estonian State has not issued bonds, the Estonian bank will make so-called substitutes within the allocated volume.
Central banks are also buying up in those countries where the offer of the bonds corresponding to the purchase scheme is limited.
According to Mr Hansson, the Bank of Estonia generally buys bonds from the European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and European Investment Bank bonds.
As of March 2015, the Bank of Estonia will purchase bonds under its asset buying programme.
Elering bonds were also obtained in the meantime, but in June 2016 the Estonian bank will no longer buy Elecircuit bonds.
On behalf of the central banks of the euro area, both Elering and the Central Bank of Finland will buy energy bonds from June onwards.
Migrants ignore degrees and return to the 'millionset of millions of businesses'
Some of the most affluent owners of the West Midlands have once again found themselves in a fierce confrontation with determined travellers, who have ignored the cradle dumped by the Council in order to win back from their cotton.
Migrants have flown their 20 trailer fences on the streets of a prosperous "one million business lines" crossed by the Someat ull.
They have returned with the army of horses, children and lorries after they were thrown out there only in May, without being thrown away by the bureaucracy dumped to prevent their invasion by the Council.
The group found a weak position in the protective limits, turning its vehicles from the unblocked part left through which it was left to football.
Mhardened residents have flew to the Someat Council by saying that the Council is' useless in dealing with the problem '.
A anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday evening after they were expelled from Bentley Heathist, where they stoned furniture.
The Council must be ashamed to take action because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The migrants were there in May, they were forced to go and now they are back again.
There were more of them yesterday evening, probably more today. "
He added: 'Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such matters by obtaining long barriers to protect its parks.
I live on the street, and I am not satisfied that I have to continue to pay the Governing Board if the Council cannot even block such a thing. "
A local resident who also wanted to remain anonymous said: 'It is ridiculous; we have just seen how the latter left these travellers, and a new offensive is already under way.
This time the number has risen and the horse has even ruined in the grassland. "
The representative of the Someat Council said: 'We are aware that the land near the street ethsbrook road is an unacceptable camp plate and we are working with the Someat ull police; we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible.
It is very helpful to gather evidence when as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police, calling the number 101.
This will help to create a picture of the situation for the Court when we present the case. "
The Weekend festival will be visited by Minister for Culture Indrek Saar, among others, who is pleased that it has been possible to bring real top names to Estonia.
The question as to why it is so important for Estonians on the Weekend festival is that it should be asked by all those who enjoy the full stories of the festival for three days.
He says, however, that real players have arrived in Persia.
'When you look at the level of artists that has been brought to Estonia, the absolute top names of this musical junior - which often does not happen in our body - are brought home by the Minister of Culture. '
Which artists in the festival, however, are speaking most about Saart itself?
I consider myself to be a relatively old and, for people like me, one of the most experienced doctors, Armin van Büren, who stood up yesterday evening.
After all, at some point, all of us, all of us, with his platitudes, have got their feet on their feet. "
He does, however, highlight a number of other names, such as Chainsolidarity, Deadmau5, Knifedin.
Of course, our own Estonian players too: Starting with NOMOP, they can be read in a whole series.

Car manufacturers are being driven by up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the midst of criticism of car manufacturers
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW said it would offer software coverage to more than 350 000 vehicles.
According to the Chairman of BMW, the company believes that 'there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions', referring to European cities, including the home town of BMW, Munich, which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that he will renew 3 million Mercedes's vehicles in Europe to reduce emissions from diesel engines.
They were not described by any company as a form of revocation.
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions.
Nitrogen oxide emitted from diesel engines, however, is considered to be carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of equipment intended to counteract diesel emissions by the automobile industry is increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While German car manufacturers are under thorough investigation, the Federal Chancellor, Angela Merkel, is accused of lecturing the powerful car manufacturers and of ignoring the signs referring to the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, who remained silent about the use of so-called 'scam devices', which made it possible to adapt the gas guides to the regulations at the time of testing a car, but have withdrawn in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been indicted in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the Audi engine Development unit was arrested in Germany.
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may be prosecuted in the United States.
Earlier this year, the Audi was drawn into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany, where the authorities accused the Audit System of being installed in order to circumvent the requirements for European emissions, thereby extending the investigation, which had previously been focused on the United States.
The inclusion of the prize in the investigation may be a major blow to the Volkswagen Agency by a manufacturer of connected luxury cars generating a disproportionate share of the Volkswagen profits.
Estonian schools are acquiring the flags of the European Union for EUR 20 000.
The Ministry of Education intends to buy the flags of the European Union to mark the Presidency by 1 September.
In total, the European Union flag of 570 educational institutions will be measured by 105x158 centimetres.
They are intended to be exhibiting in indoor spaces and must also be carried out in high-quality printed material indoors with an attestation, an ERR newsportal.
The simple label reads: 'Authorisation for Estonian schools to mention the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
The estimated cost of 570 flags is €20 000 at the Ministry of Education price, or one flag costs €35.
Journalist murder highlights growing danger in Mexico
Weekly Riodoce workers usually gather on Wednesday to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the Blue State, sown by organised crime, corrupt officials and unceasing drugs wars.
But today, under the cover of a personal tragedy, they have gathered to discuss their own security.
They are told that it is important to change their ruins.
Two senior writers are discussing which seems safer: Either to bring children with them into an office that was the target of a grandiose attack in 2009, or to leave them home.
Security experts have written three words to the will in charge of the space: 'Enemies', 'neutral', 'allies'.
They ask the reporters to give each veil's names no need, it is sufficient impressions and inner feelings.
In being on the payroll of the government or cartels, the list of drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists is suspected of being evil people who make it dangerous to reflect the chaos in Mexico.
The violence is not a breath of breath and the more dead across the country, the greater the proportion of which journalists make up, according to the Committee for the Protection of Scockers, since President Enrique Pena Lento was erected in December 2012, will be at least 25: 589 journalists will be subject to state protection after attacks and threats, and this year at least seven journalists will still have died in seven states.
The latest deaths include their editor and source of inspiration, co-founder of Riodoce, Javier Valdez Carden.
'The greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist 'wrote Valdez in one of its many books on drug violence.
His absence is deeply felt, even though his presence may be felt throughout the morning of the construction of the telecom Riodoce building, a big picture of the finger-pointing Valdez with the letter of 'fairness', and two of the 30 reports, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry T-shirts showing a face or a panopamic barrel that characterises him.
Reporters discuss common trauma, their nightmare, dreams, paranoia.
Although a separate national prosecution service was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists' cases, only two cases have been brought before the Committee on the Protection of journalists.
As in the case of most annual murders involving drug trafficking and organised crime, the number of which amounts to thousands, journalists' killers rarely come to justice.
The action of Riodoce will continue to reflect the violence in Sinalos, even though their hearts have been broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without murderers' data and justice, the meeting on security, Ibarra, says, will be of little use.
'It is very nice to waste your time in this meeting, 'he says.
'As long as the cause is unknown, you will trust everyone '.
Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan, State capital, on the morning of 15 May.
He was able to travel only a few quarters before two men stopped red Toyota Corolla; he was forced to leave the car and was shot 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper, which translates as' the twelfth river '.
An armed man went to the car in Valdez and made an accident close to it.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She and two adult children were left behind.
The rumours spread freely in Culiacan.
However, there is basically only silence on the Valdez issue.
Since the arrest of Guzman last year and the extradition to the United States in January, Blue authorisation has been one of the country's most bloody battlefields, as rival clicks are fighting to fill a power vacuum.
It does not matter that, on the streets of the blue licence, a person or even several people are shot down every day or that the dead are riddled with the double-hulls sorely decreed, which are greater than many homes living.
Let us forget for a moment that the time for peace indicates just one cartel running at sea with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers of its work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and President of Riodoce, feels deeply innocent that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes that two errors contributed to this killing.
The first was the publication in February of an interview with Guzman's sons, who were competing with and who were in war with Guzman's sons, the rhinametre Damaso Lopez.
This piece of correspondence may have been alluded to by the ruling members who are suspected of being present to buy all copies of publication as soon as they reached the shelves of the newspaper.
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country in the name of his own security after the crackdown took place in another newspaper delivery that reflected the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had lived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would be there forever.
He worked as a veteranreporter at Noroes in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling 50-dollar parts.
Bojorquez said that in Sinalo 'it was impossible to deal with the press without being affected by the drug problem'.
The newspaper ran out of touch with its courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters were keen to express strong studies without the fear of censorship and readers in a fascinating publication from which they could read stories that no one else dared to report.
Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, the newspaper won a prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for her Latin American reports.
In the same year, the Committee for the Protection of journalists (AKK) won the International Press Freedom Prize for its courage to follow the Mexican drug story wherever it leads.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said when he received the AKK prize.
Last October, he told the television channel Rompeviento in an interview that drug trafficking was a way of life in Shoaloa.
"To embrace the challenge that journalists' office has to face now is to play around.
I do not want to be asked what I did or why I did not say what is going on in the face of so many deaths. "
The Riodoce collegiate long for a teacher of Valdez, a joke who rocked like a madness, a friend who kindly shared embryos and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They supported his routine.
He was always wearing his barrel.
He moved from office to El Guatemyabo bar and was always on the same song.
Now they are asking whether his routine love became fatal to him.
His death has also led them to doubt how best to do their work and stay alive.
"They do not like the rigidity of their women, their children, their legitimate businesses, with their secret landing plates used to transport drugs."
'These things should not be touched, 'said Bojorquez.
The result, even in the best times, will be strong self-censorship and self-confidence.
Trust in your instincts.
If it smears suspiciously, it doesn't.
The problem, according to the editor-in-chief of Riodoce, Andres Villarrez, is that 'the fragrance can be decepted... and that is how it happened with Jany.'
He and others say that the old rules no longer apply in Malos, just as they do not apply in Tamaulipasis, Veracruz, Guerreros or other states, which are home to the toxic composition of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt state officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the space where Riodoce workers met for security training, mobile phones were suddenly no longer permitted; a few days before that, it was revealed that only a button sold to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two police officers sought relief from a 40 degree bullet under the guise of a tree.
They have been appointed by the government to the office of the State odoce, located in a four-point building in the centre of the Culiacan neighbourhood.
Some reporters wondered, half-joking, whether these police officers are among the 50% police officers that the Governor himself has discredited.
Several months have passed since reports have moved to mountainous areas where control is de facto in the hands of drug gangs.
This week's report by Mr Riodoce covered three main axes.
One of them was the murder in Sinaloa of former boxing legend Julio Lamberar Chavez brona.
Moreover, they had a revealing story of the spending of government funds on the town of the Governor's home town.
And people were kidnapped by one of the most expensive restaurants, from Culiacan to Culiacan, from office to quarter.
There was no official announcement of who was kidnapped or how this happened, so caution had to be exercised when it came to writing what all cities knew as a place for drug traffickers and authorities alike.
The report found out from the public documents that the restaurant has been registered as a politician who belongs to the ruling institution, the Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of policy for almost the whole last century.
Recently, several IRP Governor has been accused of corruption in court cases with wide coverage.
In Villarreal, the report asked the reporter to write previous incidents in the same place, including how the son of Guzman, who is wearing the name El Chapo, escaped a military record.
Only a few months earlier, readers would have been looking to Valdez's cocktail to obtain information on kidnapping from the best sources.
'In the past, we would have already known what happened, 'said a 46-year-old Villarline whose broker's body construction deserves a shouting name for him, El Flaco.
"Now all channels of communication have broken down with our sources."
The Valdez office has become savings on labels and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists, and the editorial staff have become something they could never have expected in the name of the press.
Next morning, Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few eyes and moved to the cabinet of the local public Prosecutor for yet another journalist's sake.
Mr Salvador Abad in the western state of Michoacan three days after the killing of Valdez.
A dead body has been found and, according to the officials, it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests.
Journalists across the country have become more vocal and highlight the words' SOS press' as an organised protest against the thugs and buildings.
On that day, the President, Bojorquez, is in Washington, trying to gather international support in the Valdez case to get justice right.
The day after the death of Valdez in meetings with the Governor of Smitry, the Ramirez authorities accused journalists of crying and killing them of telling the truth.
After that, he asked that he be diverted from government activity, worrying that he had an influence on objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were 'restricted' by organised crime, complicit state officials and an indifferent society.
In his recent book 'Drug press', he wrote that reporters not only kill drugs gangs, but also, at the behest of politicians and security forces, who are in contact with organised crime.
Articulo 19, the media monitoring group, assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and state officials last year.
"In Mexico you connect because you want to keep quiet," said Ramirez.
Murder obviously has a bloody effect.
Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipasis six years ago.
His body was found together with a letter which I think was signed by the cartel LOS Zetas: 'I am here for my reports'.
Next to his landlorinated head, computer glass and headphones were found.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, for example, in the northern border state of El Norte, Chihuahua, after the killing by March of their correspondent, Mrs Borgh.
Others are dragging on as they did after the murder of their President in 2004 in El Manana de Nuevo Laredo.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke in public about the front page of the drug cartel 'What do you want of us?'
Some journalists have fled from home states or even from the country.
This is a nervous decision.
Axony is hard to find work, and they still have to hang onto the streets in order to avoid dangers.
And sometimes they are being hunted behind, as is probably the case with photographic Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 in a Mexico corridor with four women, three months after Veracruz had fled.
Those who remain in place and continue to work must dance around risky decisions on a daily basis.
Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, recognises that reporting drugs trafficking scares him.
"Mexico is on its way to hell, and that is why I am going to report," he said.
In a recent midnight on Friday, when the latest number had already gone down, the editorial staff of Riodoce sat on a thorn in front of the office and looted a beer when it suddenly began to calibrate all the phones.
In Mazatlani, a rival city of rival gangs and security forces had claimed 19 deaths.
The war continued to estualise, as did many of the messages left by the cartels found in the region.
On the basis of the same hard line, reporters picked up the news on the Riodoce website using a mobile phone.
It was necessary to change the front of next day.
The ramifications humbled through this new exchange of fire in the region.
Bojorquez paved towards on-call police officers to see whether they are vigilant.
If they feared it, they did not at least show it.
Under the massive tree of the descendant's footwear, where his average finger can be seen in the whole of his blue room, the Riodoce workers were delivered in his footsteps.
'How can one think of closing down at all 'said Bojorquez,' whereas on the very day Javier killed, a trainee asked me to report back to the streets? '
Dinosa pressure used defence colours to prevent enemies
At first sight, it looks like a form, albeit rather frightening.
Scientists have now made public the first findings regarding the unbelievable assumption of the rallotry size discovered by the Canadian miner, which has so well preserved that the experts have described it as' a Lisat of the dindepartments Mona. '
It has survived so well that it was even possible to establish that the skin covered by his soya was a colour of the red-box Brown, and his past had been somewhat 'complicated'.
The present Biology report described the status quo as' the best preserved piece of gender pressure that has ever been found 'and' one of the best dinniture worldwide '.
Fossil is a new type of nodosaic pressure lived in the middle of the cricket era, 110-112 million years ago.
The incredibly good maintenance of this was provided by theatres describing it as' truly remarkable '.
This herbal feed covered by soya is the best preserved type of phosphorus ever found, according to National Geobroadcasting.
It was found on 21 March 2011 when he extracted the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He struck something that did not remember the thread around him and decided to look into it in greater detail.
The detected phosphorus was sent to the Paleontology Museum of Royal Tyrrell.
For the next six years, the animal was working to extract 2 500 women (1 100 kilometres) from the land area.
After all this hard work, the end result is now finally ready to be made public.
'If a bit of a bridge is torn up, one can almost believe that he is sleep, 'said the leader, Caleb Brown, a scientist, in the museum of the Royal Tyrrell, where the present is exponential.
'This will go down in scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved members of the dinosa, Mona Lisana. '
In his investigation into leather, he found that this animal feed, although covered by soya and reminiscent of a walking tank, was likely to be significantly threatened by feed pressure.
This curfew socks used a red and white defence colour to hide from predators and applied shelters technology, which is called shelter and is also used by many today's animals.
This allowed, according to experts, the dinosaur to become better integrated around and to avoid enemies, since the major dinnous pressure was likely to hunt him.
This 110 million-year-old family of nodomains first entered the news in May and is now visiting Royal Tyrrell's Paleontology Museum.
The researchers have now studied being and given it the name of Borealopelta Marmithelli, according to mark Mitchell, the museum of Borealopelta, a famous team that spent more than 7 000 hours trying to reveal it in a difficult way.
Thanks to the amazing preservation of the father's father, Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists have been able to document the shape and size of the socks on the body.
They found a shadow - a common method of protection in the country of animal origin, which means that the tip of existence was the port as the bottom of the sea.
Although the shelter is rife, the findings come as a surprise, since Borealopelta is much larger than today live with overshadowed animals.
It suggests that the dinosaur hunts were sufficiently active in other muscle feed surgery that the evolution preferred to be overshadowed instead of opposing the survival tactic.
However, most of the animals that use today's shelters - for example, fears, pig beans or scars - are much smaller and more vulnerable as an island, which suggests that the nosaic pressure had to make a real effort to survive.
'A vigorous hunt-up of the enormous and abundance of heat-covered dinshare shows just how dangerous predators may have been from the ghosts of the cricket era, 'Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds of Soomers also revealed that the dinshare pressure skin was a red box.
Scientists will continue to investigate this life, including the content of this warmongering style, in order to find out what the animal is going to eat in their last wave.
They believe that the dinosaur has plunged the river to death, thus ending up in a sea in which he has turned his back in front of the ocean bed.
At that time, Albertas was as warm as it is today in Southern Florence, and rivers and oceans are likely to extend far beyond the internal area as they are today.
"This nodosaic pressure is truly significant as it is fully covered by soya-like skin, while remaining three dimensions, preserving the original shape of the animal," said Brown.
"As a result, today's animal looks almost the same as in the boiling age.
There is not a great deal of imagination to be used to reconstruct it - it is enough simply to tear our eyes on our eyes and it seems as if he is sleeping. '
The crisis era was the time when vast two legs of meat feed surfers - heterogeneous shops - were stunned on the land.
Although King Tyrannosaurus rex of all of them lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, some of his formidable predecessors could have been hunted down by this suicidal dinshare.
These include Acrocanthol, 38 legs (11.5 metres) in a long and six-tonne monster.
Scientists whose recent findings are published in today's Biology magazine believe that Borealopelta was drowned into the sea after death and this mumified.
On 21 March 2011, Shawn Funk, when mining in Millenium, Fort McMurray near Northern Alberta, found its existence in Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved part of the world, including skin and soya, and it is a complete concentration up to insecticide.
These were on average 18 legs (five metres) long and canvassed at up to GBP 3 000 (1300 kg).
Two 20 customs terms invaded Pandora's length on its shoulders.
Scientists believe that this piece of flora and fauna covered by soya battered through the present Western Canada until the open water of the flooded river.
However, the undersea place of the dinpart pressure helped to preserve its contents in an excellent detail.
The remnants of this particular father's stone have survived so well that the titles of the mygarchies of soomers are still covered by skin remnants.
As Michael Greshko's magazine National Geointeroperability wrote: 'Such a survival rate is as rare as a lottery.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
The burnt-out skin residues continue to cover the mysterious soomers on the yellow of the animal.
A better front beats her side and the five thieves have been pulled upwards.
I will be able to read the socks that he has on winter. "
How did one activist find an answer to the question 'whose thanks?'
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was completely shocked.
Just one day after the trip to New York, it was father: StLouis resident, through his rented room, on a phone Facebook page.
He got on to the post of his former fellow countryman.
It reads: 'The police have just killed an 18-year-old youth, and he is still lying on the street'.
He was confused why no one else had posted this information on his stream, which is why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
Pidega @ TheePhaah user's postal services have been distributed several times along his timeline.
St. Shell, from the Louis region, conveyed in real time a shining book about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black young man who was killed by a white police officer in Fergusoni Missouris.
He posted a picture of the life of Brown in a body that was found on the street, leaving it for four hours.
'That is crazy, 'said Ferrell's brothers.
But death was nothing new for him or for his community.
He put his phone off, but later this evening he resaw the spark announced that people had gathered in Canfield Drive.
Photos of police and shellfish people and a man who claimed to be the father of Brown and kept the label 'the Ferguson police killed my unarmed son'.
He looked in real time at the stream where the police officer stood before a group of protesters with a grave dog.
In the second video, another police officer, he said, 'I kill you all... animals'.
Ferrell is reminded of how he caught himself from the idea of 'that is unusual'.
'This is not the kind of murder to which we are accustomed and which we could describe as typical '.
I felt frightened at that point.
I was angry and crying '.
He booked a return flight and travelled home the next day.
Having buried at 23 o'clock, he went to his father for his six-year-old daughter and decided that they would be travelling to the twofold Ferguson next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years will be the focus of a new documentary 'Whose street?' (Whom do you thank?), which will be presented in cinemas on 11 August.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and defeat, of strength and resilience from the point of view of those people who live in this community and who, by demanding answers, took to the streets.
When the Ferrell, along with a daughter - who had a flower broker on his back and had a good knuckles on it - went to Ferguson, they talked again about the experience and living conditions of the black men, which had been discussed many times before this morning.
'Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights? 'It reminds itself of asking.
'We are currently travelling to Ferguson because an 18-year-old boy was killed by the police, and that is not right '.
'I could not take him along, 'said Ferrell later.
'What is happening now is... the culmination of past events.
It must know and see this and grow in the middle of it.
He must learn about the organisation and organisation of an activist, while also knowing the different layers of experience and living conditions for the black people, and what we have to do in order to be free and free.
Even if I manage to bring him up in such a way that he does not experience blatant racism in person, he is no different from some other black girls.
I feel I would be doing him a disservice if I were to protect him from this world. "
The first suspension they made at the time of the Ferguson was on the way to South Florissanti, a place beyond the police force that had become a kind of camp site where activists were waiting for news about the police officer, Darren Wilson, who was not charged at the end of the day.
On that occasion, Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with local businessmen who made southern skies.
They put together food bags and helped to distribute them to protesters.
For Ferrell, a new type of activist has slowly begun to take shape.
'My activist changed completely after 9 August ', he said, stating that when he was a student at Missouri-St. Louis University, he was the President of the Association of National students of cancer and focused on food justice and health inequalities within Muslim communities.
"I had no organisation experience.
It all just broke out. '
A week later, Mrs Folayani, a film co-director, met during the Ferrell evening demonstration.
Mr Folayan said that he and the film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar simply wanted to document what is happening.
In the face of Ferrell, the question arises as to 'are you going to try to document what is happening or to find a story that can be exploited?'
Such scepticism was due to countless cases where people - often white - come into the community and try to profit from its protein and resilience.
The Folayan explained in a recent interview: 'We have heard that the voice of people born in Ferguson and growing up in Ferguson will not be heard and we wanted to do so otherwise'.
Folayan had already raised its hands with Damon Davis, the regional artist known for his activist in relation to sentenced prisoners.
His involvement made the project attractive for Ferrell and another six local communities, followed for years by the Whose street? 'Team following the shooting of Brown.
"In this documentary no one speaks for us, no one speaks for us, no one speaks to us, but for us, 'said Davis.
'It was important to me how these people were portrayed, because that is how I am depicted '.
Although the aim was not to focus on the experience of Ferrell - it was intended to show that the movement was not 'a head of salvation but a community coming together', as Mr Folayan said - he made a film the most open.
As a result, the 'Whose street?' Document surprisingly personal aspects of the life of Ferrell, such as mercy and marriage with his wife.
'I felt as if I was naked, 'said Ferrell, smiling over the first time that he had seen a piece of urban work.
"But I understood that there had to be a certain vulnerability to do this work and to humanise the black people."
Moreover, the Ferrell story underlines and puts the role of the black homosexual woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement at the centre again.
Two of the three initiators of the movement who thought in the social media after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 are homosexual: # BlackLivesMatter.
"In leading roles, black, homosexual women have generally maintained the movement," said Ferrell, "precisely because we have to fight continually on several fronts.
Roma homosexual women must bear the full burden. "
The Folayan agreed, stating that 'the movement is indeed kept alive by black women and many of them are black, homosexual women'.
At the same time, he says that 'this is not a kind of matter of equal opportunities' - Ferrell was not the focus of the film chosen for his identity.
'He was a man from whom the right energy was leaned 'he said.
"But it is no coincidence that she was directly situated on the front line, because there is much at stake as a black homosexual woman living in such hubs.
His energy can be perceived on the screen. "
At the same time, the news cameras Ferguson have long disappeared, but racial ties between the community and the police are still fragile.
The conditional sentences imposed on the Ferrell during the demonstration for blocking the road route will last for another 2.5 years.
He describes the socio-political atmosphere in the region he calls home as simply a 'huge free threat'.
Nevertheless, it still attaches great importance to the mantra it has eaten since it first took to the streets of Ferguson as long as three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains. "
7 To find out after the Weekent's pile of poppy
Some of the more stubborn meters find help after their meagre pipe, even though they are suffering from it.
Or from the saying 'avoid pocholli, break the pyramid'.
But this is just the inevitable postponement and proper resonance to health.
What can you do to make sure that, after today's and tomorrow's Weekend trale - or other pipe - you feel better and get out of the pot as painlessly as possible this morning?
Joo Water.
Alcohol was cut down and down, after a lot of pipe in the morning... or, if possible, not even alcohol.
As the body loses a lot of liquids when it consumes alcohol, it must somehow be recovered.
Together with water, minerals are also stunned out of the body, and the compound is a good hair's mineral water.
Since the machine is often irritated after drying, it is particularly good that it is soil-free or has only been taken lightly.
Go and walk.
Surely it would not be worth going to the grandmother with pocholl to burst trees - it could be a fatal wrong decision.
But an easy process will help the body to remember again what it is like to be alive.
Shuffling and beating out a boy is a more time-consuming way of getting a healthy diet.
Give the body energy back slowly and cautiously.
If you are already on track from yesterday's overrun, it is certainly not worth trying to pay a heavy fat.
To begin with, for example, with the new volume of fruit containing tresses to quietly prop up their bodies.
If health on the south is already suffering, one could try to get a wedding bear, for example.
And a little later on, a little bit more.
No coffee was issued.
This diuretics is releasing your body of the last water.
As has already been said, water and volume have your friends.
Contribute to analgesics.
If you take a painkiller this evening to prevent poisoning, then you have to deal not only with alcohol but also with a on-board tablet or ibuprophet, and thus lose performance.
So the rivals will pay even more, and in the future the boys will be even worse.
Moreover, the pain will not remain in the bodies of the former for too long.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, you are doing it with an empty thread - it irritates you with an already ravaged machine.
Or if a partner is not taken with it, then it can get through itself well.
It is about the same thing as walking, but there is no room for complacency in walking.
However, too active a speed and exorbitant shops were avoided - the physical effort should be moderate at the time of the pot.
A joke.
There is a silly talk, easy fun and nail-friendly talk with the friends of time and with others (suffering).
A Nazis and a woman may not be driven away, but they certainly make it easier to tolerate after the phenomenon.
Once upon a time, the pocket is going through anyway!
A worker at the University of Northwester and Oxford is being sought as suspects in murder
According to the police, an employee at the University of Northwestern and at the University of Oxford is being sought nationwide and has become suspects after deadly March wounds of rubbish finding the bodies of a male people in a luxury corps in Chicago.
According to the Cook County's documents, an arrest warrant was issued on Monday without any bail-out for the arrest of a 42-year-old Wyndham Lathemi and a 56-year-old Andrew Warreni, accused of being murdered by their alleged involvement in the first instance, Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleu.
According to the documents, a 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleu died after repeated marriages.
According to the warning issued by the police station in Chicago to the community, the body was discovered to be dead on 27 July.
The police received a telephone call call and found a victim on arrival in the Grand Plaza Korterhouse with several stormy plans on his body.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranleu was recognised to be dead and investigators regard ambush as murder, while the police actively seek two suspects.
Ms Lathem has been working as co-professor of microbiology and immunology since 2007 at the University of Northwester.
In a statement sent by Vice-President Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President for Public Relations of the University, Lathem has now been temporarily removed from work and banned from entering the cities of the University of Northwester.
"This is now a criminal act being investigated by the competent authorities, and the Northwester University is working with the investigators," said Cubbage.
Wretn is a senior assistant at the University of Oxford.
In a statement sent as an email to the University and Somerville College, "we have been in contact with the British police and ready to help the US investigation authorities in every possible way."
In addition, the statement stated that my colleagues at Warreni were shocked and willing to present themselves.
Anthony Guglielm, head of the communication department in Chicago's police department, is urging suspects to be handed over to the authorities on suspicion.
"The police have an idea where they are, but we are working on the exact location increasingly intensively," said Guglielm.
Guglielm says that the local, regional and national authorities are helping to search for suspects.
Guglielm said that the police got a telephone call from the Grand Plaza House administrator, who had just received chryptic rain that something had happened in apartment 1008.
According to the police descriptions, this was a vivid view.
According to Guglielm, it is not clear whether the event itself took place on 27 July.
He said that the safety cameras confirmed the presence of Lathemi and Warreni in the building.
"We believe that Professor Lathamal and the victim had a relationship," added Guglielm.
The Grand Plaza leadership sent a letter to the population: 'The police are currently working to find out about the orchronology of events and the background to the victim, and are looking at different motives, including the possibility of a family dispute'.
Firms that help your company avoid becoming the next Ubby
Amy Errett wanted to measure workers' satisfaction in his e-commerce start-ups, but the polls were futile.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse still, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some workers did not trust this process.
'The system was simply not consistent and objective 'said Errett, who runs an e-commerce company, Madison Reed, which sells Jewish care products in San Francisco with 75 employees.
He has therefore called on external actors to help.
Start-ups dealing with new types of human resources are emerging, helping companies to find out what their workers feel.
By developing and licensing software aimed at measuring the involvement of workers, they allow companies to make app surveys, to target specific teams and demographic groups, to offer anonymity and a hot line of complaints to workers, and in some cases to allow them to bypass C-level managers and to address the Governing Board directly.
"There are now tools such as Strava and Fitbi for health monitoring, but where is Fitbi for your company?" Said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO Reding City start-ups Glint, whose software analytical tool is used by companies to measure worker involvement.
He has got a much better picture of what his staff think and feel over the three years he has used in Glint.
In addition to opinion polls aimed at intrusive studies and certain teams, it provides a company's thermal card, which gives an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest level of support, enabling them to identify the causes.
Companies have started to realise that they need to stay informed about their working culture in order not to change to the next Ub, which has been revolted in scandals since the former employee published bloggers describing a harassing environment in which those who dared to speak were punished.
For start-ups such as Glint, the desire to have an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global area of governance, regulation and compliance may be worth more than USD 1187 billion by 2020, according to the website of financial statistics, Let's talk-about payments.
This year, against the background of the dubious reputation of Uber, a start-up company operating in Colorado, which helps businesses to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour, observed an increase in interest and activity.
The Code has almost 600 customers, including Airbus, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered himself as a customer.
Like Glinki, the convergence cent allows companies to send adapted impulses, collect real-time confidential responses and look at problem areas of heat cards.
It also provides an anonymous model of message that enables workers to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when it comes to the executive director, complaints go directly to the Bureau.
"Public opinion has been delivered by regulators," said Customs centi founder and CEO Patrick Quinlan.
I am going to say that if a company finds that it mistreated its workers or behaves unethically, it could face serious consequences, such as consumer boycotts, the withdrawal of workers and court cases, even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene.
Heading T, a restaurant with more than 25 000 employees at 500 sites, has used the convergence census for more than a year to ensure workers' awareness of the rules and procedures and to provide an easy way to communicate with the Corporate headquarters.
When a worker wanted to report a problem earlier, he had to find a telephone number or email address at the corporation headquarters, make a formal appeal and hope that it would be taken seriously.
This was often a daunting and uncomfortable process, said Ruby Prime Counsellor James Vitrano, who said that there was no good way to monitor workers' complaints.
However, now that the company is operating on convergence centi, problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair pay practices, which did not previously lead to managers operating in offices located in other cities or states, can be identified and dealt with more quickly.
"I can get closer to the holistic 360 degree experience of the workers," said Vitrano, who chairs the Ruby telecommunications risk management group.
"And we will protect our shareholders from legal disputes with workers."
I was saying that companies started to take ethical behaviour, values and workers' involvement much more seriously in 2002, after an auditor, Arthur Andersson, collapsed due to ethical irregularities in relation to the Enron scandal.
However, only when 'social media became mature' did companies realise that they could not prevent their black washing from being publicly beaten online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both the city and the convergence cent offer their software as a service, taking a periodic fee from companies for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors, who have supported both start-ups.
The convergence was funded in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and the then Capital, thereby increasing the capital collected to USD 47 million.
In November, the Glinti invested USD 10 million in Bessemer Venture partners, increasing the company's total funding to USD 60 million.
Such investments will come as no surprise, given the interconnectedness of companies, culture and venture capital.
More and more studies show that today's workers expect more from the workplace than they have done in the past.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are merely contributions on the table.
The workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they are devoting their time to a company with a positive mission.
'When people are happy at the company, they feel they are listened to and more satisfied with the work they do, 'said Nina McQueen, Vice-President of the Department for General benefit and Workers' Survey, LinkedInis, which uses both convergence centi and Glinti.
Investors will earn money if companies in their portfolio do well; companies will do well if workers are committed and involved.
If third party analytical tools allow for an increase in the commitment and involvement of workers, then it is no wonder that they will receive support.
Having data on worker involvement is important, according to professionals.
However, this data will be useless if it is not followed up by company supervisors.
In fact, when a company asks for feedback from its employees, it may raise expectations that change is ahead of us.
And if change is not made quickly enough or not at all, it may cause disappointment and reduce workers' involvement.
'When you ask for 4 000 proposals, you have to be prepared for 4 000 conversations, 'said the President of the Consultative and Business Administration, Kotter International, Russell Raath, who has seen companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
"Because if things do not finish, the workers will think: 'Did you actually listen to me?
Do you care?
And if you do not care, why should I care? '
According to an Erretti, the Madison Reel, which is now carrying out six studies among workers, has been able to take action on the same day that the problem has been reported through Glint.
And, having received feedback from workers disappointed with the speed and quality of the decision-making process, he was able to reorganise a number of crews in the company and offer communication training to tackle the problems.
However, Ruby interoperability will collect new data on workers and it is hoped that, in the long term, this will lead to a longer-term commitment from industry, known for its high turnover.
'If you are not committed to transparency, you lose people 'said Vitrano.
'If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose your customers, you lose companies'.
Baltic States: Fast-growing incomes
Although the 2008 crisis and trade concerns with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic, the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the income of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bomberg is writing with reference to the European Central Bank report.
According to the Central Bank, since 1999, total economic output per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
This success is due to low indebtedness, fast-moving institutions and business-friendly and non-market-friendly policies.
"The Baltic States, together with Slovakia, are among the few countries in the euro area where reactor GDP per capita has moved significantly from shopping to EU average."
Although the objective is for the total economic output per capita to be equalised to a richer Western Europe, in 2015 the total output of the Baltic economies per capita amounted to only 2 / 3 of the national average for the 15 countries that were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round.
Low wages have led the Baltics to seek better wages abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic countries in a positive light and the economy is growing this year, the local people are not enthusiastic at all.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of people in Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies were doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, just under half of those surveyed thought this about their national economies.
NCAA's decision to cancel trends twice a day makes Bruinsi long
It is almost 23 o'clock when football clubs at the UCLA League are stopped for discussion at the end of a new exercise in the university town of a team.
Some of them have burdened their businesses with the effort made on the first day of their training camp.
For a large part of the team, these Christmas minutes offer a break from midday to midday.
Players taking part in the course of the course will return, after a three-hour trend, to studying the cohabitation for final examinations before returning for next morning's 6.30 meetings at the WSF football escort.
'The next three days will be a real challenge for them, 'said Jim Mora, the Bruinsi trainer, shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA decision to cancel trends twice a day to reduce the burden of players has, in fact, overstretched their days - at least until we get one half-way through final examinations on Friday.
For this reason, the first three courses of UCLA were timed to start at 19.15 in order to fit in with the already dense schedule of players.
The transition from two to more days on a daily basis means more days on a trong - the start of the Bruinsi training camp has been increased almost a week ahead compared to the previous season and, for the first time, during the six Westwoo season, training sessions are taking place during summer courses.
They are planning until 20 August to 18 trends before formal preparations begin for the opening game in September against Texas A & M.
According to Mora, he is in favour of a change of the NCAA rules, although it adds another item to the players' tight schedules.
"They have a huge burden on three or four days and that is a serious challenge," said Mora.
"And they are going through this challenge; they are struggling, they are wonderful young people.
I believe that when it comes to Saturday and we have more time, it will be a real pleasure. "
Once the camp is over, UCLA training will be closed down, which is no easy task, however, given the clear view of their remote parking plate and remotely located at the centre of Luskini, a high-class hotel, which has already arrived at a gateway through a protective network surrounding the gateway.
Since this weekend, hotels are occupied by players in Bruinsi, but Mora acknowledged that problems could arise during the season with free tobacco.
'Let us take security measures, 'Mora said.
"This is a real cause for concern and it is no exaggerated to think that people can rent a mouse and filter from there.
If you have a record of a training, you can do quite a good deal.
But we use the security team there and at the 8th parking station.
We will do our best to use what we have.
I will try not to worry very much about this.
We have a plan in place. "
The Sastaare-Ivanova electoral union born of the Central Party, the disenfranchisement of Kristiina Orange, who was expelled from the reform party, and forced to withdraw from the ECB for the bringing together of the forces of Maria Kaljds, to our Tallinn and the parties, seems to be showing at least as much as the political parties involved in the local elections this year.
However, buses will be counted in the autumn, and the key question will be whether they will have sufficiently disappointed voters.
Who will remain in Sastaarea?
How small the support department of Edgar Sastaare has decreased, one can foresee events organised to honour his electoral union.
One member of the National Assembly, some former and present parties and many unknown faces: Will this be the composition of the electoral Union?
And why, in Tallinn, some of the faithful supporters and friends of Sastaare avoid standing in, can one ask that the 'Sastaare list' of the companies, led by corruption and suspected of corruption, is becoming a reality?
A Russian-speaking poem involving the parent of the town's city's city's city's envy; and, in all respects, a primitive computer game in which Prime Minister Jüri Ratas, while travelling on a radair, must avoid stray and slaves - is this the Central Party the first attempt at the votes of 16 and 17-year-old voters admitting ballot boxes?
We look forward to seeing what other parties' perception of the youth campaign is.
There are two options to accept that only ETV, ETV2, ETV +, Tallinn TV and English-language France24 channels will henceforth be viewed as opposed to entertainment from the beginning of August: To accept that, in future, only 10 television operators will see the wheel2, the ETV2, the TV3 +, the Tallinn TV and the English-language France24 channels or will be surrendered every month.
There are probably also those who initially openly rejoice in the free television experience of advertising, but in the end, though reluctantly, pay for television sets and advertisements.
Indeafening music, laden nation and rubbish left on the streets are almost an unpleasant side of every major music affair.
However, if the honey itself does not want to be part of it, it is worth going home to discover a homeland instead of painting for its head - and leaving the sleeping room for the Coptic sum of the festivals.
Washington changes rules on Green Card
Media publications quote President Donald Trumpi, who said that there is a new US immigration plan which will change the rules of the Green Card.
The plan foresees a reduction in the number of legal immigrants for 50 000 people per year, stricter rules on obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republican people and supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars' taxpayers' money because it will change the way the US handles green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme.
The new application process will give priority to candidates who speak English and have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills to benefit our economy, "said Trump, the US media outlets.
Siberian seto young people are moving to the city, to pensioners, back to the land.
Anatoly of Jevseyev continues the tradition of famous seto gold miners along the Maana River in the past.
She works 140 kilometres away from her home, at the Maana supplementary war at Kuvai, as a head of the gold-screen on the car.
It is a tough job: Two months of work for 12 hours without rest days, and then only 10 days at home and again back home.
For three years, Anatoly has only once seen its culmination in the order of business.
'That is a thorny regime there: When you go into it, you do not get the grade, and when you go on to not take it with you ', Anatoly speaks.
Mare Piho is speaking in the village of Haida to a local seto Jaan, who has spoken to him a great deal about the memories of his family in Siberia.
The archaic culture that remains in Siberian setos will also affect home-seals, as it is simply so dramatic that it will think most deeply about the distant seals investigated by Piho Mare.
His first trip to Siberia will be 30 years later this year.
During that time, he has been there 14 times and lived there for one year.
How many went out to Siberia at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century to get land here?
This is an unresolved issue.
I would argue that 8 000.
I took this out of the story of the men in Siberian seto, who have thought about it themselves.
It is precisely difficult to say, because up to 30 people may have come to one group at the time, but the passport was given to a man only.
Only one passport was issued, but had children, sisters and others.
Look at how large that territory was here!
It was several times greater than historical Setko.
After all, it needed to be educated, managed in some way.
Setry came here as peasants, but their lives changed, because here they got into areas that were not just linked to agriculture, but also to the river (pale-parking), gold mines, industry.
For example, in New Petseris, many seals later went to work in a classified city of Krasnojsk-45 (where the Soviet authorities built a uranium enrichment plant - J. P.) when it was formed.
Did the semen form the majority of the population in this region at the time?
Yes, they were living in a Compact.
In addition, the tradition of marriage and multiculturalism maintained a long time ago.
Seven to eight children in the family were common.
How much of the Siberian compound culture differs and differs from that of the mother country?
They are different, although what was brought here was once the same.
They brought a great many ideas to the people.
They also did so themselves (ideas of the people) at the time, but they always made a distinction between what had been brought about and what had been done here.
Climate change has had a severe impact on the traditional clothes of seals, because it is colder here.
The proposed changes were made.
For example, Setomaal had a salt plate, but it was simply frozen here.
Where are the Siberian seroom villages and what life will live there? / graphics: Alari Paluends?
The link with the mother country was spiritually strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that this country is now going to give back there, will influence them.
The girls who have lived in families have listened to amazing stories.
Piho is thinking of people from the Estonian seroom delegation who came to Haida Bay Day at the beginning of July and lived in homes - J. P - for four days.
What is still here is shocking.
'It is extremely easy to come and get off the ground, because the city has a great location: Railway beer and road crossing the border ', says Taps's operisolist Reigo Tampere.
The city is no longer just a military capital; we have a lot of nature, sport and culture, and the carrot gets everywhere.
Tapa is a tip-fleet!
There are small islands on which to keep alpine poppies common to be held from the town through the current white river.
'There is no room for this beautiful train window, 'Reigo is muddled.
Those who are not afraid of cold water can flood into the river because the river is full of sources.
I have been there, I can do it!
The river's water can keep the length and simply make the romantics - one can look at the flow of the river and think ahead and think about life.
I, too, have been there with my bride.
Apart from anything else, Tampere has been on the river stretch between the three bridges: 'As this place is next to the city, no one may even be able to stand up if their stories are told'.
"A wonderful view of Tapa is emerging from the toy hill, but there are also health professionals where you can run, you can skie the winter and now, for example, you can play a discgolf's game: The golf path has been taken, the supermarket can lend from the sports centre," Reigo presides.
The old protagonists, of course, go there with their own spring, but I have not yet got there.
Obviously my colleague, Rasmus Goll, must be invited to visit Tapale, because he has experienced a discernment of a discernment and he has a heretics.
Perhaps he will lend me!
Reigo and Männikup were inseparable from the current period of their opera-purely childhood.
At least during the skiing hours.
There are many tears, many frustrations and you can go on to this memory in my sporting life.
Not to mention broken banknotes and banners.
"The city as a whole is now full of construction works, all this is changing to a senseless', Reigo praises.
However, an old and tired boy building is a very attractive place where oral discoveries are played.
I am pleased that, in 2012, the leader of R.A.A.A.M adopted my idea in Meos and had to make a permanent summer theatre with his theatre.
Although this year's theatre season 'Aleeyi Karenin' has just come to an end, on 11 August, the railway station is' Elludding ', when the old stock is moving around the 1980s.
"Between 11 and 13 August, Tapa will be the city of Tapa's Day, which has been following a series of open house tissues and a series of cultural events including a crowd of people," speaking in Reigo, who is just calling for a visit to the city from 9 to 11 years.
In a poor three-chamber on the bottle of 1 May, the museum has already been on the way since 1994.
'The house is small, but the exhibitors are a great deal of information and vast amount of information ', praises Reigo's place, full of the history of the city of Tapa, most of which focuses on rail and military activity.
Reigo mudens that, if Tapal goes through all the recommended sites, the stomach will be empty, but fortunately the small city will be full of cafés.
'We have such good diets and sometimes get the feeling that you are abroad when you sit in cafés', he describes.
Well-educated and young soldiers who come to Tapa spend a lot of time in pub cafés, and the seams are striking there with the feeling that you are in Estonia and in your home town, but the round is a multinational company of this kind.
I believe it would be very exciting to listen to stories from the French or American side.
Wars, yes, we are moving a lot!
In Greece, two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal tendering
Television channel bTV quoted a foreign Ministry who reported that two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for having ordered illegally.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of illegally ordered persons were arrested by the police on the island of Sithonia, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but an investigation is currently taking place.
The Foreign Ministry said to the television channel that Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free tendering and are already imposing heavy penalties on anyone who is caught in a holiday place that is not intended to do so.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
The wolves that teach the armire are breaking the sheep.
The farmers on the shelf have to give their 'educational material' to the wolves again after a year - the wolves that have obviously taught spawns have already broken up a lot of sheep.
This year, the wolves in the county of Hiiu have broken sheep three times, 23 sheep in total, and eight have been injured, writing the Hiiu site.
The soil had only three figures, 124 years earlier.
In syndrome, there are also data from the Environment Agency that wolf washing machines were not born on last year's Hipe land and that information from the Hipe Council on the fixing of two wolf washing machines on the island this year.
Against the Ecolabel on Monday, the wolves unleashed 15 sheep in the village of Kabuana and injured 18 survivors.
In the early morning of Wednesday's morning, the wolf broke one lamb on the County of the Rehelin village and severely injured another, who had to be subjected to an emergency killing.
The rules on the management of genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a coordination round the Law on the release of GMOs into the environment (GMOs VS) and a draft law amending the plant protection law.
The amendment of the law removes the creation of a separate collection of data both for GM (GM) crops and for operators, using a future plant health register.
In addition, the GM crop operator is changing the obligation to have prior agreement on the radio to apiculture-handling person.
Although GM crops are currently not grown in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of GM and non-GM crops.
This is at least as long as it has not been decided to declare a GMO-free in Estonia, "Sigmar Suu Kyi, head of the plant health department at the Department of Rural Affairs, said.
"At the same time, we need to take into account that the measures we have developed need to be targeted and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burden for both the private and public sectors."
The draft act repeals the provisions relating to the collection and training of GM crop locations and operators in VS, lays down requirements for the management of GM crops and the opening up of economic activities.
In particular, with regard to beekeeping, the GM crop farmer's current obligation to inform beekeepers about the cultivation of GM crops with the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with apiculture before cultivation begins.
The draft law has been sent for coordination with ministries.
All interested parties will have the opportunity to examine this in the information system and, if they so wish, present their views to the World Department.
The proposed changes will affect, in particular, those in the plant farming sector, beekeepers and the Agriculture Agency.
Only one GM crop - mon 810 - can be grown in the European Union, including Estonia.
To date, however, no Estonian farmer has taken an interest in growing GM crops.
The reason for this is that Estonia does not have a Main charity, a European corn for which the maize line mon 810 is resistant.
The articles on this landline have also been closed to the southern regions, and this is inappropriate for our climate conditions in May.
In 2015 and 2016, the Department of Rural Affairs commissioned studies to detect contamination of potentially GM organisms in seeds for various types of fattening, maize and soya grown in Estonia.
The analysis of the tests carried out showed that seeds were not present and that the study concluded that the seeds of increased rape, maize and soya in Estonia did not contain GMOs.
The previous one, in turn, suggests that there is no deliberate cultivation of GM crops in Estonia and no random contamination either.
Jose Mourinho thinks that Manchester United in Nemja Maticu, in the form of "genius"
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United States has hijacked a 'genius' in the form of Nemanja Maticu, after being opposed to the central player Samotoria on Wednesday evening.
A player bought over GBP 40 million from Chelsea in Dublin, in the last pre-seasonal game in Unites, started before UEFA Super Cup, a real Madrid victory in initial rivalry on Tuesday 2-1, giving an impression of a defensive role, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were able to travel freely during an attack trip.
However, leaving aside the pre-seasonal Asian architecture of Blues, Matica sorely missed mammoth and received only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, must be corrected before the Premier League season began.
'He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, genius thinking - he has football champions, 'said Mourinho.
"We will help it achieve a form as soon as possible."
Like the executive, in the Aviva stadium, other new recruited Victor Lindelof and Romlu Lukashenko started off and Mourinho began to quietly put his man in place at the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three footballers, but he confirmed that the club had already done "excellent work" by concluding contracts with three of its four priority options.
"I am grateful to the club for having been able to realise three out of four," he added.
'I will be even happier if they are able to deliver four of the four, but they have worked very hard for me '.
Another poet got a foot on the GSM Embassy on 1 August and this time in Mesty.
According to Mati Martinson, a ferry observer, who is living in abattoirs, the first baby became an Embassy in Sperry, and this washer is already flying around, leaving the washing ground and joining the great collection of fodder in Mullutu-Great Lakes.
This is because Sham is not fertile fields, the voice of islands writes.
This Tuesday, relatively late in the day to clear up the courses, the Embassy received another hangman, on the island of Mesu.
Mr Martinson said that the installation of Embassies is in fact an international project carried out by Mr Leito and Mr Ojese.
The soil was served by a puppet called Mati GSM accompanying Sperves Turkey.
"His activities are all online: How he went to the winter in Spain, came back long on the German-Polish border and then to Saareland ', Martinson spoke.
British inventor to install a microchip in his own body to get into a handful of houses and cars
A British inventor became the first person in a country to be fitted with a microchip so that he can only open his example with a handful, get into an office and even get a car off the ground.
33-year-old Steven Northam's children were able to install a small chip between his trodder and his desk and are now also offering this service to businesses and private individuals through their own Biotheq company, who want to make life easier with technology.
He has joined forces with Dr Geoff Watson, a consultant-anestesiologist from the Royal hospital of Hampshire in Hants, to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
The technology is similar to that of the microchip installed on cats and dogs, and the procedure takes just 30 seconds.
The Northam company will also replace the snow of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, asking for GBP 300 per lock.
This father of a child in marriage has stayed in the technology now, both at home and in his car BMW Z4, which will start when he has his hands on the wheel.
Eponder of the White House cost taxpayers thousands
According to military documents published during the magazine, the White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter last month for an attempt to celebrate American production has cost the southern taxpayer as much as USD 24 000.
The green and white colour, Sikorsky VH-3D, called Marine One under the presidency's presidency in office, was the central figure for an event presenting the American construction programmes in White City on 17 July.
President Donald Trump, senior officials of Vice-President Mike Pence and the White House announced industrial products during their tour of all 50 states.
The helicopter set up in Connecticutis was exhijacked together with a hunt from repute, a Wisconist fire-fighting car and a two-stroke from Missister.
According to the documents of the eskar Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), who is responsible for operating the Helicopter, the White House's military office called for the presence of a helicopter's office, known as the FARGO, barely stunning 36 hours before the helicopter buried for an extraordinary event in the South.
'I wanted you to be aware of this, because it is an unusually high-profile event, 'said HMX-1 commander a day before the event in an e-mail to his superiority, the Deputy officer of the navy in the field of aviation.
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive in the southern horror at around 7 p.m. on the morning of 17 July and stay there until the Christmas night between 18 and 21 is cleared.
What was added was the fact that, should there be a departure from the White House, a second-hull is needed for a return flight due to the restrictions on working time.
The original flight team was at the helicopter during the event, and the security team stayed near the aircraft for all the time it was on the ground.
It was not possible to find out from the documents that were submitted to the magazine whether or not it was ultimately necessary to have another brick boat.
Hatch's law prohibits federal workers from using government property for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 examined whether this event could breach this provision.
"We asked whether it was in breach of Hatch's law and we were told that it would not violate, 'wrote commander.
'It seems that you have no choice, 'responded to the Deputy senior officer.
The White House declared the 'American made in' event to be an official event, and the Hatch law would not have covered it.
But even the official events have political undertones.
The President backed the efforts of the Health Reform under discussion at that time in the Senate and praised efforts to keep government regulations in check.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One or Air Task Force for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them purely as a photograph is unusual.
In February, a Trump came to the attention of a President's plane at his first campaign event, Floridages Melbourne, and he displays Twitter's account of messages complaining about the way in which his predecessor used the plane.
"White Mak is very pleased with the display" made in America, "where products from all 50 states produced by American workers were represented," said Lindsay Walters, spokesman of the White House.
HMX-1 teams often carry out test flights around Washington and in the south in order to get used to waving down the United States President's White House with a single-metre accuracy.
When Trump was in Germany at the start of July at the G20 Summit, HMX-1 waged 58 tests landed in the HMX-1 White House season.
According to the official, the flight 'American' flight crew was included as the standard for the monthly study flights to the 'American' event.
Monday's helicopters flying for 11 hours on that day on top of the 'non-presidential support missions'.
According to the White House, none of the other exhibitors of the event were burden on taxpayers' purses.
According to the representative of Sikorsky, the company was not involved in carrying out excitement at the southern horror of the helicopter.
HMX-1 will not maintain the budgetary documents for the President's flights and the precise costs of the event will be difficult to identify.
But at the Ministry of Defence's prices for the financial year 2017, the VH-3D reimbursement rate is USD 24 380 per hour per flight.
The Eskar documents indicated that the flight would take longer than 30 minutes from Quantico Airport to Virginia, its main base.
The White House claims that the real cost of using the helicopter is well below its sum.
"Calculating taxpayers' costs on the basis of estimated compensation rates is very misleading," said Walters.
'That's estimated compensation rates include many other irreversible costs for staff, maintenance and expenditure which will be taken into account for annual appropriations'.
According to the rand survey of 2015, compensation rates at the Ministry of Defence do not include personnel costs, but they cover fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
The former spokesperson of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of helicopter at the time at the event.
"The point is to show things made in America this week," said Spicer.
"And I know that the State of Sikorsky and Connecticuti is very proud to contribute to our national security and that there are expected to be hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which so many Americans have worked tirelessly on.
So of course it is right to highlight this. "
It is not clear whether or not the Trump had to deal with the helicopter when it was circulating in the southern horror, but he was lying behind the fire-fighting car.
In the White House, Trump Sikorsky addressed representatives, throwing out the media caricatures of a company's products on its own aircraft fleet.
'I know Sikorská very well, 'said the President,' I have three of their products'.
Gri Šadeiko - By tears, peace and joy arrived
Mil Daegh in 2011 hit Šadeikot in the last area, 800 m of beverages ran a stadium, and was taken away from the stadium with a camera.
Just before that, he had received a zero degree of distance from his universitualist in China.
In 2012, Helsinki was the victim of a cheap injury, but in London, he received 6013 points 23 from the debate.
However, the misfortune continued.
Following the opening day of 2013, the Moscow Moma received a remote Flash injury from an Estonian record.
Two years later, he held 15 seats in Beijing's Mil and held the Olympic orchestra, but that, too, had wanted more frustration on the part of the athlete.
Only last night, Šadeiko did not receive a letter of result initially from the Amsterdam EMW.
I would just like to put together, once or for once, one proper multi-contest.
Once ', Shadeiko sprayed'.
Worse still to come: A month later, his Olympic competition in Rios broke the first hurdle because of reigning.
The time had to be taken out - to carry on with the seven competitions at all?
Is the effort of two days worth all of this?
Neiu thought for a long time, but found peace.
I was able to think clean on my head.
It is quite difficult to describe this experience, but I have wondered that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to cure ourselves healthy and think twice.
"I knew I would not put a bag on my desk yet," said Šadeiko about his self-cleansing.
I was able to turn a page and move forward with a new momentum.
Treener Anne mäki said that it was very difficult to look at the suffering of the careless, but she realised that the athlete itself, above all, had to find its own clarity.
After all, he was so whistleblowed down by everyone.
It was difficult to tolerate.
'The Gál said, however, that he will not give up and he wants to prove himself what he is worth 'says a mountain.
Now there is some sort of peace in it.
He is doing so to his joy.
The contest came back in May when Šadeiko set 6280 points in a new Estonian record in a series of competitions between Gsonzis.
In a high-level contest, he improved his personal high-level heat requirement by almost a metre (13.89) and ran at a record near-time barrier.
Then, a multi-competitor felt that it was not at all possible, but that only the initial hunger had been eradicated.
A mountain who guided him for years says that Šadeiko is a black pupil.
He is a sportsman, he is a good teacher.
If something is wrong or wrong, he says so now.
He knows his own body and entrusts his own sense.
That is what we have to do.
I cannot say exactly what to do and follow it up.
Šadeiko has also found a new approach.
'I am not the one who makes the maximum of the trend ', he talks and says that the most important thing is to get the feeling right, because it also ensures a good result.
Baby baby boomers are happy
The good emotion has also been offered the good luck of the people who are close.
Both his former training fellow Member, Maris mäki, and sister de Grete, have recently become parents and have received support from new weather citizens.
'It has been quite interesting ', says Šadeiko.
One alcohol whose drinking equates to the brain 'training'.
Livestrong writes that Dr Gordon Sheperd is even such a big wine fans that he believes that wine can train better than any other trainee in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
He says that this is not about alcohol or about how it affects our feelings and our ideas, but about the 'very active' process of tapping wine.
By citing a glass, by stirring it up, enjoying it and discerning a aftertaste, we are putting our brain into work in order to create a taste for wine.
Sheperdi said that the bovine images do not actually contain a taste, but that the taste arises from the way in which the wine stimulates the brain.
He makes a comparison between how the brain sees the colour.
"Taste is not wine, taste creates a taste for wine," says Sheperd.
The things that still affect the taste of wine are, for example, our age, our gender and even the amount of heart that man produces.
Sheperd, of course, is aware that wine is not so full of hair.
'There must be more ', he says.
If you take too much bang, the system has saturated.
Excessive drinking of wine can do harm instead of brain benefits - according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glass with wine, loss of memory, loss of balance and reduced mental capacity risk.
10% of workers in the ICT sector in Estonia pay less than colleagues
Data from the personnel search company Fontes reveals that 10% of workers in the Estonian ICT sector are paid less than colleagues.
The 10% pay gap is between men and women, the Geenius portal writes.
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the Fund's ICT sector wage study.
A total of 8 577 posts were examined.
63% of posts were carried out by men.
"While only 3 companies concluded that the pay gap is for men and that there is no pay gap for the rest of companies, in reality, compared to the reality, men's monthly basic salary is on average 10% higher than that of women and the men's total annual salary on average 8% higher than that of women."
Narcose 3 season advertising clip: Now Pablo Escobar has gone, the Cali cartel takes centre stage in the Netflix Hittsdoctor
Despite the fact that the killer of Pablo Escobar was revealed in the second season of 'Narcos', the Netflix sari is far from over.
The third and fourth season has been confirmed by the streaming service and the first has already been produced by a advertising clip that is permeating the horns with the new bad.
In the third season, the DEA will turn its attention to the richest drug business organisation in the world - the Cali cartel.
They are acting under the leadership of four powerful crosses, 'like Fortune 500 companies', simply with more bribery to the government and more violent acts.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, with Mr Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) its ase, Mr Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) leading links with Mexico and Mr Chepe Santamentariz London (Pepe Rapazote) operating in New York.
In the newly released advertising clip, Pedro Pascali sees his return to Javier Penana as a factor who recruits American and Colombian legal protection against drugs in the war.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of 'Narcos' will open on 1 September.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
The head of the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that the elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
The leader of the United Nations Assistance Mission, Nicholas Haysom, said that hundreds of women would stand for election in local Soviet elections, three women stand as Vice-President and more than 30% of newly registered voters are women.
"Emphasising the importance of women's role cannot be exaggerated," he said in a statement made on Wednesday.
The elections can truly represent the people and can only be credible if women are fully involved and involved in all stages of the electoral process.
Elections and presidential elections in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban, for their part, have threatened the electoral process, which coincides with a transition period in which the role of international military operations becomes consultative.
This year's elections mark the first time that power has been transferred calmly from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to the clone, a strong role for women increases the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent electoral Commission for Afghanistan, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million voters have registered with women.
The joy of sharing makes every single thing more acute, both large and small.
There is always too little time in common, but the trend is a good opportunity to combine meeting, play, closeness and burden.
And what a convenient solution - wherever you are in the summer, living accessories are always with you and impatiently remember with your fine voter: 'Let us make a move now!'
With insulation without a start, it is very good to have a normal gold game or to slip through a coastline.
Which is the cornerstone of survival in the form of shoes and tuna - who would like to take the form of a sand code stunned by waves during the summer?
It is wonderful to have children instead of cannabis!
Firstly, it is safe and comfortable, and the difficulty is gradually increasing at the same pace as the staff of the trainer.
Advanced can also be heating with quite a large number of children.
The child is training the balance, reading the corps and feeling lax on the possibility of beating high and important.
Larger children can, at the same time, take heating for themselves.
The scope of the movement lies in the problem of land and in the rush to land.
Keep your finger straight, the pale mini-jets high.
The child can read the flats and feel like a trainer.
The planet is an extremely rich but hopelessly boring exercise for the child.
But it is easy to relax!
Game-plank: Take a long planguoln from which to tear through the record.
In fact, it is more difficult than usual, but much more relaxed, to do than to give hands to a friend in the meantime.
A plant, a tear market, can be maintained to add the burden and can also walk around this location.
An additional difficulty can be made to sit on the winters of a minor child, but the exercise offers fun for all children.
While crabs are sleeping in the sand, the triumph, ash and chlorine meat are becoming as infected.
The child keeps on his feet in such a way that his or her body is evenly distributed in advance and behind.
A hand can be kept in check for tourism.
Sliver legs and stall straight up.
The sun can fly, relax, strike a balance and be difficult.
The life of a small engineer is an exhortation when he gets small things every time he comes up.
The additional burden will be to pre-empt the bickering of feet.
Check that it remains in a neutral position.
Children themselves have a lot of aerial meat to carry on in a couple and with a plate.
A cook with a pulse and a pulse.
That followed a child's safety, an agonising position, and kept a back in a neutral position.
All children's favouritism and great fun!
A mother who is truly effective at the same time as the whole body trend.
Sport tools included Ott (10), Säde (8), happiness (4).
Trip from the Philippines to the heart of moefficient games in the wider world, the Algkot
Timeline bags are a summer class which, in recent years, has become a fait accompli product in itself and which has even had to be hanged at the end of its hand by the right client, and which has been used by traders, regardless of its modest origin, to display an additional price label for hitic.
The sickening bag is probably one of those things that has existed once in life and which has not been aroused by much emotion.
It simply exists, and if it does not exist, there is nothing wrong with it.
Now, however, the beer bags are making a real race, and the scans have switched their fine designer bags from simple beer bags over the summer months.
That being the case, it is not only a coastdog, but today it is just as popular as a street chamber and it even serves to walk into the office with bolder women.
However, it is worth making it clear here, before doing so, whether it is going to be a summer hall or whether it is worth putting a mark and a laptop computer on a little official summer.
However, the diversity of mediation has made the beer commuters a genuine summer love of women.
For example, when reading foreign moillogists, the first thing to do is to note that the moeoghurts are the first thing to do on holiday on the local market and acquire some beer bags to which a whole holiday is then carried and which go along with beaches, the market and also, as a friend, with a woman on the city's doorstep.
Some bloggers are even so generous that they buy a larger wolf on the market and sell or give them away to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting, however, that there is such a high demand for bags among readers that women (and men!) in the real world apparently go on to each other to become a happy owner for some homes.
In a sense, this madness is also understandable, as rare times are when, in the fashion of yesterday, it is possible to buy something into a puzzle for a few tens of euros.
It is true that rosy traders have also found easy money to make here, and so the more sophisticated luxury brands also sell their bags for a few hundred euros and a few thousand euros.
Obviously, in order that richer customers do not have to feel like simple mortality, who try around with some cheap bags.
For example, it is possible to buy Dolce & Gabbana's beer over EUR 1 000.
However, for the interpretation of Chanel's translation, EUR 6 000 can be proposed in the circular.
However, unlike most of the modelled buildings, the beer doesn't inherit at all from some of the great Cape Verde, but their story started far beyond.
Indeed, the beer bags are said to be very much from the Philippines, where they have been worn off.
Fighting is primarily an export business there, and it is very often the case that local cooking is taking place.
Admittedly, the flourishing technique dates back to the 14th century and is rather rife with the usual basket.
However, since the beer does not have to be as red as cork, it is possible to have an inhabited Muslim and other material that makes the cocktail more personalised and, by extension, more progressive.
Recently, for example, trendy bags, where paint strips or skins have been cooked in, are particularly trendy bags.
However, an actress's Jane Birkini can be sent in particular by beer bags, the largest beer fan of which had not been seen before.
Indeed, he even suited the brewing to all sorts of clothing complexes and did not have to go much with it to the Cannes Film Festival.
However, the fact that they are popular today does not have a smaller role to play, but that caring for them is a bullet and, unlike all other ski products, they do not have to be nurtured by special means, but also by water and wet dirty.
As is always the case with trendy robbery initiatives, apart from the classical appearance, brands have come up with all manner of interpretations.
For example, if you want to, you can obtain a bunch of clothes from beer beer or a tiny log of rubber.
It is worth remembering, however, that a classic beer bag will never go from fashion to beer flu.
But what is the classic beer, then?
For centuries, this kind of straw of beer, reminiscent of its style, has been considered classical and has been opened on the spot and has been short, as well as on beer, pitfalls.

A missing man on the island land three days ago was found
On Wednesday evening, you left your home in Kärla's Alevi unknown.
The telephone was the last contact on the phone yesterday, Friday evening and the telephone positioning provided the man with a seat on the west island, the village of Milles, from which he was searched with a helicopter to midnight and with dogs to his property.
He then became empty on his phone, and his whereabouts were therefore no longer possible.
The police continued their searches this morning.
The police thank everyone who contributed to the search for Aare.
GMB is concerned about investments at the McVitie plant in Glasgow
The trade union is expected from leaders of the mature producer McVitie about long-term production plans at the company's Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has kept quiet about the future of the investment in customs interoperability.
More than 500 people are employed in a theatre producing Hobnobsi and rich well-known cookies and other products.
The owner of McVitie's company, Mr Pladis, said that he had invested more than GBP 5 million in the site over the last few years.
Workers and trade union chairmen were paid there 'are the first to hear' when something changes in the operation of the plant '.
In a letter to the head of the company, GMB Scottish company McVitie appealed 'for concerns that funding would not be used to modernise production lines'.
The GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy said: 'The fact that we are not getting clarity from the head of the object on the business needs of Customs and the future investment plan is a matter of deep concern to our members.
Many generations of families have been employed here, and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and people around the Glasgow region, an essential pillar for ensuring proper employment in a region with high unemployment and social housing.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and well-being in the east of Glasgow, and in view of the increase in living costs and the chronic fall in production, a thriving McVitie company is in dire need. "
The planned representative said: 'The customs transfer site manager received a letter from GMB Scotter only yesterday and the company answers him directly because we value active contact with workers and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting was held between workers and representatives of the GMB in Customs and openly discussed a number of issues.
We discussed with the workers at that time that, like all the other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are reviewing our activities on the spot - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - in order to ensure that we are competitive.
He added: 'In recent years, we have invested more than GBP 5 million in the customs transfer site, most of which has gone into production lines and improvements to operations.
We fully understand Customs mark as an object of production and, should there be any change in its activities, workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it. "
Did the PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about taking an approach to Neymarii?
La can regret its interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up efforts to attract Neymar to his ranks by offering an amount of GBP 189 million to buy him, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of this record seizure trip?
This thorny approach has opened the summer's transition window, and the Ligue 1 club is ready to break over the current world record of buying more than twice that set by Paul Pogba's return to Manchester Unites at the last season, for GBP 89 million.
Once the transition has been completed, Neyra will become the most expensive player in the world, as well as the most highly paid professional athlete in the world, who, after taxes, will be paid over GBP 500 000 a week.
Barcelona is, of course, angry because of both the approach and the break-up of Neymari, although the source close to Catalansi's board confirms that the club has always looked after the best since its arrival in Santo 2013.
But did the PSG President warn the world of the football world of such an opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed an interest in the conclusion of the Blaise Matued Agreement in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif strongly warned all clubs thinking about recruiting some of the best PSG players.
'I am not concerned because they know that when they concern some of our players, we stand up to them and make contact with their players, 'said Al-Khelaif.
"We respect all clubs.
But when they try to conclude an agreement with some of our players, they have to face the consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have gone beyond this limit, as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed an interest in the PSG central player Marco Verratti.
The PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could suffer a setback as a result of this interest by removing one of its precious assets in the form of Neymari.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges, not borders, after Brexitit.
"Brex is seriously threatened with a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Great Britain and Ireland," warned Varadkar on his first visit to Northern Ireland after he took office in June.
"I cannot imagine who would benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made the current free movement of people and goods possible, said Varadkar.
"This is our vision for the future: Building bridges, not borders," he stressed.
He said earlier that he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union and, as it cannot, will remain part of the European single market.
This would maintain the current free trade between the Irish Republic and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make Britain's departure smoother would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, explaining to the Irish Prime Minister.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said, 'We could certainly have this with Britain'.
The alternative to this would be a return to customs points that would declare historical divisions and political failure.
'To bring about trade, prosperity and peace 'said the Irish Prime Minister.
She mentioned Brex's' challenge for our generation 'and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland's daily lives.
Irish Prime Minister Belfast met leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland.
Avand, through her first half-long triathon, everyone will be able to walk through Ironman.
Today, Oteway, in the winter capital, was held on the largest triathon tariffs in the Baltic States, when about a thousand triathletes from more than thirty countries came to the one-and-a-half-long Ironman contest.
A collection of 70.3 miles consisted of 1.9 km of flooding, 90 km of cycling and 21.1 km of cycling.
Among other things, the first triumph of his life also ended the martyr Avand.
"I thought it would be difficult and, in the end, difficult," said Avand in the finishing line.
Despite the difficulty, Avand has proved that in fact, the triumph is ripe for almost everyone.
'Even not the dance kills, but the pace kills', he said, suggesting that, at an appropriate rate, everyone would reach the finishing line.
Except for Ott Sepp, 'If you like it is fine, you cannot swimming'.
Avand had already been doing a good job since February.
Initially 4-5 hours a week, and later ten hours a week.
With time of 05: 34: 12, he achieved 27000th in overall terms.
Although Avand lost both Raio Piiro (time 04: 59: 53) and Jürgen Ligi (time 05: 06: 37), she won other so-called 'prominent classes' competing.
Tanel Padar, who was a good example of personation last year, lost seven minutes to Avan (time 05: 41: 54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05: 50: 23), Kalev Krnew and Raivo E. Tampere in about an hour (times 06: 31: 53 and 06: 45: 18 respectively).
The overall winner of the cycle of men in Otepää, part of the Ironman series, was a German, Johannes Moldan, with 3: 58: 27, the best of Estonians was Ivo Larr with 04: 14: 09.
Among women, a Danish woman, Helle Frederiksen, won 04: 24: 01, while Maria Jänese, who lost almost half an hour to Frederiksen and received 04: 58: 58.
Avand went through a 1.9 km swimming distance in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out for 4 410 positions.
