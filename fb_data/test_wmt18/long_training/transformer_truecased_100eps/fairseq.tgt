four Cape Verde group members were detained in Estonia and Spain
according to postal law , in Spain , the head of the so @-@ called Cape Verde group , S@@ val Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch , a leader of the Estonian Union , is detained by the police , known as &apos; Cape Verde &apos; , in the criminal world .
Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch detained in Spain was arrested on trial permission .
yesterday , the Court also arrested three suspects in Estonia .
the suspicion is that members of the so @-@ called Cape Verde criminal association are aged between 27 and 57 , who are mainly responsible for drug crimes .
in the province of M@@ ala in Spain , the alleged leader of the criminal organisation was detained .
in Estonia , three men were arrested as suspects , one of whom is , according to data , one of the leading figures of the criminal organisation , and two are members of the criminal organisation .
the data collected indicates that there was a clear division of tasks and roles within the criminal community .
the purpose of the criminal community &apos;s activities was to commit drug crimes and thus generate criminal profits , &quot; commented the head of the pre @-@ trial criminal proceedings , the public Prosecutor Va@@ sil@@ Ver@@ te .
&quot; we do not exclude an increasing circle of suspected criminals in this case , &quot; added the Prosecutor .
these are people who have been in the interest of law enforcement authorities in the past , and some have been punished for drug crimes .
Ver@@ te stressed that cooperation with my Spanish colleagues has been important throughout the investigation .
&quot; international cooperation has become common@@ place for us and this week &apos;s operation shows the success of this cooperation , &quot; said Public Prosecutor Ver@@ te .
the head of the Central Criminal Police Department , ago Le@@ is , said that detention was preceded by an investigation going on for nearly one and a half years .
&quot; in the first half of the week , we realised long @-@ standing work while suspected of committing crimes in Estonia and Spain , &quot; he said .
it added that central police officers were instrumental in detention in Spain .
for years now , we have had good contacts and understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard .
these arrests are yet another message to the criminals that we can get them out of another European end , &quot; said Le@@ is .
the information gathered up to now clearly indicates that , in freedom , suspected men can continue to commit new crimes , which is why the prosecution service requested and approved by the Court of Justice .
a man arrested in Spain is waiting for his surrender to Estonia .
under this criminal case , property , vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure confiscation .
the criminal case before the trial is organised by the Central Criminal Police Office for organised crime and is managed by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office .
the Tallinn City Court sentenced Mr Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch in 2005 to blackmail and punished him with five years in prison .
in the middle of the last decade , Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ ch was considered the second most important man in the criminal world of Estonia following the then alli@@ ances of Nico@@ lai T@@ aran@@ ko@@ v .
Cape Verde , Mr Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch , came to the head of Estonia in the early 1990s , when he started to engage in blackmail in Tallinn .
Ad@@ mittedly , he taxed tax@@ es tax@@ is and prostitution for various ho@@ tels and claimed monthly ro@@ of@@ ing fees for business@@ men .
international joint operations , confiscation of criminal assets and entry into force of judgments confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective .
for example , the latest judgments , eight defen@@ dants of the so @-@ called D@@ ik@@ ye@@ v criminal community who were confis@@ cated EUR 80 000 in criminal assets , or nine individuals who had been sentenced to the effect that Ig@@ or Ale@@ y@@ ni@@ ko@@ v set up a criminal association in 2006 aimed at the illegal trade in , and the crime of , smuggling and trafficking in , cigarettes in Eastern and Southern Estonia .
the seiz@@ ures of criminal assets amount to nearly EUR 71 500 .
in these criminal matters , it has ensured success that police officers exchange information and evidence every day with their counterparts abroad and , if necessary , carry out joint activities in any country of the European Union .
civil rights group war@@ ns Mis@@ sou@@ ris@@ se about travelling
the National Association for the People of C@@ olo@@ red People ( NA@@ ACP ) has warned Mis@@ sou@@ ris@@ se @-@ travelling black people against discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the State .
the statement of the group reads : &apos; the NA@@ ACP travel mark for the State of Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i , which runs until 28 August 2017 , calls on all African American passengers , visitors and Com@@ m@@ ons to be particularly attentive and extremely cautious as they move around the State , given the dubious racial events which have taken place recently across the State and which have been pointed out here &apos; .
according to NA@@ L@@ N , both the recent Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i law making it harder to win cases of discrimination and the fact that minorities are the targets of state law enforcement to an uneven extent .
&quot; people &apos;s civil rights are being violated .
they are taken as a result of their sk@@ in colour , beaten or killed , &apos; said R@@ o Cha@@ pel , President of the NA@@ ACP Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i branch , to The K@@ ans@@ as City Sta@@ r .
&apos;@@ We have never received such close complaints before &apos; .
this is the first such warning that an organisation has issued against a US state .
the group &apos;s expression refers to events such as racist insul@@ ts against black students at Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i University and the death of the 28 @-@ year @-@ old black story S@@ and@@ er@@ si , T@@ en@@ nes@@ see .
S@@ and@@ ers died at the beginning of this year in dubious circumstances , after having been through petrol in transit through the state and under arrest without charge of a crime by the Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i police .
in addition , the comment refers to a recent report by the Chief Prosecutor of Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i , which shows that the cars of black drivers are likely to be stopped by 75 % higher than those of the white men in the state .
&apos;@@ The comment is intended to make people aware and warn their families , friends and working partners about what can happen in Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is &apos; said Cha@@ pel .
&apos;@@ People must be ready , whether it means taking on bail @-@ in money or informing relatives that they are going through the State &apos; .
according to the latest information from the F@@ B@@ I Programme on hate crime , a hundred hate crime was recorded in Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is in 2015 , placing the State in its si@@ x@@ teen@@ th place , in terms of the number of similar offences .
a travel warning is also a response to a new law by Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i , which makes it difficult to appeal to the company &apos;s courts for discrimination in search of housing or work .
the American Civil Society Union ( American Civil Society Union ) had previously issued travel notes for T@@ ex@@ as and Ari@@ z@@ ona , following the adoption of immigration laws by these states , which obliged the local authorities to arrest people for immigration offences because , according to the AC@@ L@@ U , this increases racial profiling .
normally , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issues travel warnings about other countries , but recently interest groups have started to use this measure as a reaction to certain US laws and trends .
He@@ pati@@ tis : what would anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease ?
He@@ pati@@ tis , or li@@ ver combustion , may be caused by five different he@@ pati@@ tis A , B , C , D and E .
all these vir@@ uses provo@@ ke a li@@ ver @-@ tor@@ n combustion .
however , the unhealthy cost is chronic he@@ pati@@ tis B and C , which can continue to be a li@@ ver cir@@ cus , or a li@@ ver horse and li@@ ver cancer .
Ku@@ wa@@ r , an epidemi@@ ological Ad@@ vis@@ er of the Health Agency , states that the phenomenon of acute he@@ pati@@ tis disease is the same for all types of li@@ ver @-@ burning : f@@ ever , fa@@ ti@@ gue , pl@@ undering , birth , po@@ pp@@ y , di@@ r@@ ty pain , grey ex@@ o@@ dus , we end up with horse mackerel , meat and class pain , and s@@ na@@ m and hy@@ th@@ ol@@ lah@@ s .
the crow@@ ded name of li@@ ver @-@ burning also comes from the last hour of disease .
children can experience he@@ pati@@ tis without disease .
it is only possible to determine the various types of arsen@@ al based on laboratory research data .
O@@ ver @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis can become chronic he@@ pati@@ tis and go on without disease for decades , which means that you may not know anything about your harmful li@@ ver disease .
Mr Ku@@ wa@@ r points out the various forms of he@@ pati@@ tis and describes their evolution in greater detail .
he@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses the disease from man to person and infec@@ ts us when eating contaminated food or drinking water , by b@@ read@@ th , by be@@ ans and from a few foodstuffs , soils , objects , me@@ als and drug consumption .
a he@@ pati@@ tis infection is caused by family members and carers at risk of disease , people suffering from chronic li@@ ver diseases , people who are infected by sex , men who are sex with men , drug addi@@ cts , passengers who visit countries with high he@@ pati@@ tis A .
infection can be prevented by vaccination , in particular , by recommending vaccination for people who travel a lot and who are at risk of he@@ pati@@ tis A .
furthermore , it is important to comply with daily hygiene requirements : to was@@ h or dis@@ infec@@ t hands , before being used for food , to was@@ h all fruit and vegetables .
b . he@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses ill to come into contact with the blood of the human being , injec@@ tion of drugs , pa@@ tho@@ gens , honour treatment , blood @-@ contaminated fo@@ me@@ ters ( den@@ tists , means of pregnancy ) , donor blood , he@@ pati@@ tis , sex and he@@ pati@@ tis disease from animals / new@@ born babies .
Sy@@ n@@ ant drug users at risk of he@@ pati@@ tis infection , sex partners of the infected person , sex men with men , new@@ born mothers of the infected mother , sick family members and carers , blood and other body liquids are exposed to health care , rescue workers and police , and passengers visiting countries with high he@@ pati@@ tis B .
in order to prevent he@@ pati@@ tis , it is possible to vacc@@ in@@ ate people ; in particular , it is recommended that people from the at @-@ risk group be vacc@@ inated , as well as those suffering from chronic li@@ ver diseases , HIV infections , sexu@@ ally transmitted diseases and diabe@@ tes .
b ) The other preventive measures against he@@ pati@@ tis are : prevention of the use of alien hygiene and man@@ ic@@ y@@ ms , other sharp tools and need@@ les , re@@ par@@ ation and honour , and use of con@@ d@@ oms in the event of a dangerous mix@@ ture of infection or the prevention of sexual risk behaviour .
vaccination against he@@ pati@@ tis b is part of the national immun@@ isation scheme and is free of charge for children in Estonia .
He@@ pati@@ tis C vir@@ uses ill to come into contact with human blood , injec@@ tion of drugs , pa@@ tho@@ gens , honour treatment , blood @-@ contaminated fo@@ e@@ tal use , donor blood , he@@ pati@@ tis @-@ infected sex sex and he@@ pati@@ tis @-@ ill fo@@ et@@ uses / inf@@ ants .
Sy@@ n@@ dro@@ ve drug users at risk of he@@ pati@@ tis C infection , infected people &apos;s sex partners , sex men with men , new@@ born mothers of infected mother , sick family members and carers , blood and other body liquids are exposed to health care , rescue workers and police officers , HIV infections , and passengers visiting countries with he@@ pati@@ tis .
He@@ pati@@ tis C is a preventive measure : prevention of the use of alien hygiene and man@@ ure devices , other sharp tools and need@@ les , re@@ fin@@ ement and honour @-@ relief , and use of con@@ d@@ oms in the event of a dangerous mix@@ ture of infection .
there is no vaccine against he@@ pati@@ tis C .
He@@ pati@@ tis D causes he@@ pati@@ tis , which is ri@@ fe in the presence of he@@ pati@@ tis B .
as a result , he@@ pati@@ tis D suffers from infection with he@@ pati@@ tis B or from chronic he@@ pati@@ tis B as a form of super @-@ infection .
d he@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses exposure to blood and other body liquids , contaminated need@@ les , sexu@@ ally and rarely infected fo@@ et@@ uses .
He@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis is a chronic he@@ pati@@ tis B virus and non @-@ human immun@@ e to he@@ pati@@ tis B .
an effective preventive measure is vaccination against he@@ pati@@ tis B , which also protects people from infection with he@@ pati@@ tis D .
He@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses fe@@ e@@ ble drinking water and food , including little heat @-@ treated beef , fish and marine sh@@ ell@@ fish , donor blood , collective need@@ les and infected animals from a mother .
passengers may be infected by he@@ pati@@ tis in high mor@@ bid@@ ity countries .
hygiene requirements are in place for he@@ pati@@ tis prevention measures : was@@ hing or dis@@ infec@@ ting hands after be@@ ating , before c@@ oo@@ king and eating , after sick care .
F@@ ru@@ its and vegetables pre @-@ consumption , prevent the feeding of little heat @-@ treated beef , fish and se@@ af@@ ood , drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug consumption .
although competitors attempted to printing off the four @-@ year Olympic winners on the last round , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old F@@ ara@@ h has found power in the final straight and won over 2@@ 6.@@ 4@@ 9.@@ 51 .
F@@ ara@@ h did not mean long enough to take the hus@@ band T@@ ania and the children with him after the fin@@ ch .
this was a special moment for me .
I very much love my family .
it was wonderful to be on their path , &quot; said F@@ ara@@ h to the journalists .
F@@ ara@@ h aims at the fifth title competition in London , which is running from 5 000 to 10 000 metres of gold .
everything is possible when there is a belief in it .
in spite of the title , Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;@@ Con@@ imi@@ i &apos;s &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; , a wonderful story of G@@ usta@@ mer Climate &apos;s mas@@ ter@@ piece , A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri &apos;s t@@ ree &apos;s special story , goes far beyond the birth of a artistic act in the late 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century in Vienna .
but even more deeply in history .
a more narrow subject would have been allowed to have a greater impact on the extraordinary fo@@ am allowed in the title .
at the moment , the story of A@@ tel B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri , which was portra@@ yed by a G@@ ood Climate and his pain@@ ting in Da@@ am gold , and a much larger and more comprehensive newspaper from estee@@ med Jewish families and German occupation , with its implications in Austria , would be like some of them .
the first third of the book leads , in the middle of a w@@ ed@@ ding Vienna cultural life , and who was himself in the Austrian capital , can hardly imagine how life went around R@@ ing@@ st@@ ras@@ s more than a hundred years ago or how the Cen@@ tr@@ al coff@@ ee all turned their heads when the climate came in .
the concentration of cultural figures in one of Europe &apos;s rich@@ est cities was a high and well @-@ known name , seeing itself as if it were more like a grams of culture .
however , the fact , for example , that S@@ ig@@ mun@@ d Fre@@ ud acted in a city where proliferation of un@@ treated ar@@ son and Europe was the highest level of suicide , creates a development story like nothing more .
or perhaps , however , every single bat@@ ch of beau@@ ty will add colour to the culture of Vienna at the beginning of the 20th century .
dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
in the last few decades of the 19th century , the number of Jews had explo@@ ded in Vienna , turning into the largest Jewish community in Western Europe .
almost one in ten Vi@@ in inhabitants had an exchange of views .
A@@ vana , too , were new@@ com@@ ers in Vienna , but by the time the hel@@ ple@@ ss@@ ness of A@@ rad was twice opening up with the Czech sugar mag@@ na@@ ad Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ lo@@ ch and climate for his famous pa@@ int@@ ings , his father had already received the seventh largest bank in the H@@ ab@@ s@@ burg E@@ mp@@ ire .
but the whole gla@@ mo@@ rous life he belon@@ ged to was not taken .
if you look at the &apos; Da@@ ami gold &apos; , it is hard to believe that , in the end of life , it was infected by a great Lady soci@@ alism and dre@@ am@@ t of travelling from the Soviet Union .
by 19@@ 33 , when Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ lo@@ ch decided to order his hus@@ band &apos;s portfolio from Climate , the hot @-@ day pain@@ ting officer in Vienna was the last minute .
the cli@@ ent ordered at that time cost 4 000 kro@@ ons , a quarter of the price of a well @-@ established rural house .
the fact that , in some of the t@@ ree , the champion &apos;s ar@@ m@@ ire was suspected of having been mo@@ del@@ led , the sugar mag@@ na@@ te was not intimi@@ dated .
as far as A@@ fi@@ as is concerned , the only sure fact is that the close relationship between the mo@@ del@@ li and the ar@@ tist that has emerged during the work has continued throughout life .
Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;@@ Con@@ nor - &quot; Da@@ am gold . &quot;
Mr B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri &apos;s special story of G@@ usta@@ m@@ t Climate C@@ up , &quot; Var@@ ra@@ k 2016 , which translated Al@@ do R@@ and@@ lands from English .
just before the start of the work with A@@ dele@@ e , the Climate was visited by Ra@@ ven@@ na San V@@ ita@@ le , and the investi@@ g@@ ators think that the bri@@ lli@@ ant mo@@ sa@@ ic mo@@ sa@@ ms that we have just seen there , from Im@@ o@@ dor@@ a , gave the ar@@ tist the idea of making a gol@@ den t@@ ree of A@@ dele@@ tion a colour as a mo@@ sa@@ ic .
the cli@@ ent was presented in Vienna in 19@@ 68 in his &quot; Da@@ ami gold &quot; and around the same time ( 19@@ 07 @-@ 19@@ 08 ) another gol@@ den land was born in the &quot; novel &quot; area .
the artistic his@@ tori@@ ans did not fail to notice the simil@@ arity of the two women .
how is Hitler about nature ?
&quot; I think I owe him to remember my friend Climate to make his way to the public &apos; , A@@ tel B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer wrote to the Director of the Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere M@@ use@@ um a few years after he left the ar@@ tist ( Climate died in February 19@@ 18 ) to go to the M@@ use@@ um of the Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere M@@ use@@ um and wanted their family &apos;s Climate colle@@ ctions to go to the muse@@ um .
six years before the death penalty , the customer had completed another t@@ ree of A@@ dele@@ tion .
in his wil@@ l@@ ness ( in February 19@@ 25 ) , he also asked her hus@@ band to leave her two por@@ ters and four G@@ ood Climate M@@ use@@ um to Austrian Gal@@ er .
she inh@@ eri@@ ted her bel@@ o@@ ved words to Mari@@ a and Lu@@ il .
one year after the Climate had finished the &apos; Austrian Mon@@ a Annex &apos; , an attempt had been made to get into the A@@ ka@@ de@@ mine of the Ka@@ th@@ mand@@ ar@@ ies of Vienna , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Ad@@ ol@@ f Hitler , but failed in the drawing room .
although , at times , Hitler &apos;s later anti @-@ S@@ emit@@ ism is considered to have not been accepted by Jewish profes@@ sors as a result of the anti @-@ S@@ emit@@ ism , none of his ex@@ ca@@ va@@ tors was actually Jews .
in any case , the role of the Austrian Gal@@ er , which was referred to in Maria wil@@ ment , had changed considerably by 19@@ 39 , and it was important to find ple@@ asing works for the Naz@@ is in Vienna from the rich Jewish arts .
Hitler &apos;s personal artistic wealth was matched by some work at home , but not by those of the climate .
Si@@ x@@ ty years after the March of the Naz@@ is , a 10 @-@ year dispute between the Austrian Government and the he@@ irs of B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ mers began .
it should only be noted here that , if the &apos; novel &apos; can be seen in the Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere Cas@@ tle in Vienna , A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer &apos;s de@@ pic@@ tion of the &apos; Da@@ ami gold &apos; is to be viewed from New York to Ne@@ ue Gal@@ er .
and before Vienna , to read through the aforementioned book .
even if you do not plan to look at the work of the Climate , because my emo@@ tions at least revol@@ ved around Nazi and Jewish issues more after the book was closed than the 135 million dollar @-@ sold swe@@ et A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer .
so it is not so much a mar@@ ried t@@ ree , rather than a tri@@ bal emb@@ assy - and it is a very moving story .
the orientation of events at the beginning of the book has greatly facilitated the relatives of the Bau@@ tes .
17 @-@ year old sw@@ im@@ ming in Canada was very close to the Estonian record
in living life , the gold used to be 200 m of in@@ sec@@ tici@@ de very close to the personal record of 16.@@ 62 .
the Ti@@ pp@@ mark dates from a 17 @-@ year @-@ old festi@@ val a week ago , when the Canadian football Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ship won 2.@@ 16.@@ 58 , Pri@@ it A@@ av@@ ik &apos;s U@@ ju@@ m blo@@ g .
gold ended up perhaps in ten final zones A @-@ fin@@ als .
in the final h@@ all , he went through the distance of 2.@@ 15.@@ 76 and achieved a good seventh place with a new powerful March of excellence .
the Estonian record of A@@ lina K@@ end@@ zi@@ or ( 2.@@ 15.@@ 13 ) left the Gol@@ den for just over half a second .
gold has risen third in an all @-@ time ranking in Estonia , and its fresh personal peak is the fifth result ever in Estonia .
a young hope for the future is still starting at Canada &apos;s adult Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ship with 100 m , 200 m and 400 m in wh@@ is@@ tle@@ blow@@ ing , and 200 m@@ m and 400 m in bun@@ dling .
last week in Tor@@ onto , we had the Canadian football Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ship , and the gold started off there as well .
he won 200 m in wh@@ is@@ tle@@ blow@@ ing for sil@@ ver med@@ als during 2.@@ 0@@ 3.@@ 22 .
it was so quickly sw@@ am@@ ped as an act of distance last year by 2008 .
the Gol@@ den season is one that only Estonia &apos;s record , E@@ lina Par@@ tar@@ ka , has distan@@ ced itself from .
another winner in the Canadian pat@@ ron@@ age is the b@@ ron@@ g me@@ dal in a wonderful personal record , with a new Estonian March of peak of 5@@ 6.@@ 66 .
for example , the year @-@ old Ker@@ tu ly Al@@ ne@@ k of her year @-@ old Ker@@ tu has moved away by just one century faster .
he reached a further 100 m in the field of sw@@ im@@ ming in the theat@@ re in an open exchange of information at 1.@@ 0@@ 3.@@ 69 .
at a longer distance , it only gained its seventh seat when it dro@@ ve in the final seat at 2.@@ 17.@@ 31 .
gold is currently in charge of four different ran@@ k@@ ings of the Estonian season .
President T@@ ru@@ mp goes on holiday , critics fuel too@@ th@@ ms
the time for holidays is now - that also means a rela@@ xation for the US President Donald T@@ ru@@ ps .
however , since T@@ ru@@ mp has so far been the President who has taken the most holiday days , critics are already spar@@ king teet@@ h .
according to the US hu@@ b CN@@ N , 17 @-@ day leave is planned by the President at the un@@ spent traditional gol@@ f club B@@ ed@@ min@@ ster in New Jer@@ se@@ y .
although the President &apos;s holiday began yesterday , anti @-@ T@@ ru@@ p leave has been spoken about for a week .
they are giving the Olympic Games a clean @-@ up all too often .
indeed , the President has an un@@ spent week exchange time in his F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and New Jer@@ sey cotton .
incidentally , T@@ ru@@ mp has no longer had the cle@@ arest president in his 19@@ 6 terms of office .
for example , George W@@ . Bush had already reached 67 days on holiday with Barack Obama less than half the T@@ ru@@ mp , but 21 days .
however , the Olympic Games tend to forget things quickly .
a few days after becoming President , T@@ ru@@ mp &apos;s programme called &apos; 60 minutes &apos; said that there would be no time for long holidays for his pro@@ po@@ ser , because there is a great deal of work to be done .
he also objec@@ ted to Barack Obama &apos;s holiday three years ago .
the current President wrote on Twitter at the time : &apos; while Obama is on holiday , gol@@ f , sole@@ mn and j@@ uni@@ or groups are playing on their sole@@ mn lines , in Italy journalists are pul@@ ling their heads out . &apos;
the 17 @-@ day gol@@ f club visit does not , according to the officials of the White House , have any rela@@ xation at all .
instead , it is officially called &apos; work holidays &apos; , during which the Olympic Games have no time to read or to engage in any other kind of activity .
in addition , leave had to be for another reason .
that is , the western system of the White House is being replaced by a special structure , which is why all the staff had to leave it .
the West wing is also based on O@@ val@@ ry &apos;s office and other presidential premises .
&quot; I do not think any of you would like to be in the West in August if there were 38 degrees and no office pension for the White House , &quot; said L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters , the spokes@@ person for the White House , who stressed that the President would continue to work during his holiday .
where President T@@ ru@@ mp will spend 17 days next , you will get some idea of the video .
blocking critics on Facebook : do not apply for national office unless you tolerate voters &apos; criticism
our father knew a lot about unfavourable media coverage .
the Americans lo@@ ved George Washington , but the newspapers did not go long to start bul@@ lying him for everything from internal politics to political principles .
he was , of course , upset by the criticism .
however , he did not force his critics to remain silent .
because in 17@@ 83 Washington said that &apos; freedom of expression can be taken away from us , and in dar@@ k@@ ness and silence we can be led like sheep on slaugh@@ ter@@ houses &apos; .
this brings me to Mar@@ y@@ land &apos;s Governor , Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work hard to be more Washington @-@ like .
the ho@@ use@@ keeping has blocked and deleted the pos@@ sessions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page .
and later this week , he was therefore taken to court by the American Civil Liberties Union ( Civil Liberties Union ) .
the govern@@ or &apos;s office pic@@ ked up the action empty and web commen@@ ta@@ tors were ri@@ d@@ dled with counter @-@ reactions in the style of &apos; who is interested ? &apos;
&apos;@@ Th@@ at is just Facebook , &apos; many said .
but that matters .
and that is particularly important when it comes to a man like Ho@@ gan .
it is an ama@@ zing popular Re@@ publi@@ can govern@@ or in an overwhelming democratic state .
his discharge percentage is the second highest among the 50 govern@@ ors in the country .
it is not an un@@ thin@@ kable wh@@ is@@ tle@@ blow@@ er .
he has been leading the state firmly and firmly rooted in his principles .
in addition , he has used Facebook as the main tool for communicating with his constituents quite deliberately , for example , by putting his head off his stone for the first time after a chemical waste .
thus , the Governor &apos;s website in interoperability is a public forum with official marking , managed by blocking the personnel paid by taxpayers on dollars &apos; wages for people visiting property , which is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview given to The Washington Posselt , the spokes@@ person of the Ho@@ gan press , defended the behaviour of the Governor , claiming that blocking comments was nothing more than moderate .
but it is all too easy to pa@@ int a picture of online check @-@ ups , spa@@ m@@ mers or people full of anger .
the post had discussions with a number of quite people whose Ho@@ gan was blocked .
that is exactly what they are about , in contact with their chosen leaders : the teacher , the company &apos;s owner and passport holder , not Internet controls .
they all said that their comments were respectful , considered and not ro@@ sy at all .
Pas@@ tor quoted the Bi@@ ble in his post , op@@ pressing the Ho@@ gan Catholic movement .
a lawyer from Bo@@ wi@@ e , L@@ ak@@ sh@@ m Sar@@ ma Ra@@ man , did not inci@@ te hatred , but rather hate crimes .
&quot; I poli@@ tely commented that I am disappointed because he has not responded to hate crime or other recent news , &quot; he wrote in the heading of the news story of The mail .
&quot; nor do I like the idea that when many people comment on the same subject , some call it an in@@ difference to a collective effort rather than admit that they are a great many concerned citizens . &quot;
what the Governor &apos;s officials called &apos; targeted spa@@ m attack &apos; would probably invite others &apos; to &apos; public support &apos; .
the Facebook era can easily reconcile messages by simply blocking criticism or dele@@ ting negative comments .
it is much cleaner than in the past when , in order to do the same , the workers had to be expelled so that they could gather and bur@@ n the newspapers with critical edit@@ orial letters , or arrest the protest@@ ors and make them remain silent .
but that is exactly what is happening now , purely digital .
the Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to be criticised for making Facebook and other social media too@@ th@@ less .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i has taken Twitter users to court and has been blocked from Twitter &apos;s stream .
one of the first land@@ mark judgments on this subject was given last week in Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
in Alexand@@ ria , the US Dis@@ tri@@ ct Judge James C. C@@ ac@@ her@@ is decided that the Cha@@ ir@@ woman of the Coun@@ ty Board of supervisors of Lou@@ d@@ oun@@ i broke the first amendment of the constitution when he blocked the constitu@@ ent from his Facebook page .
in K@@ enn@@ tu@@ ck@@ ys , for example , the use of AC@@ L@@ U Facebook and Twitter , Governor Mat@@ t B@@ ev@@ in ( R ) also visited .
it should not be so difficult .
during Washington , affordable postal costs had the same effect as the Internet .
between 17@@ 76 and 18@@ 00 , the number of newspapers and anon@@ ymous wri@@ ters da@@ m@@ ned in his way of leadership .
even then , Washington had to deal with anon@@ ymous controls .
people wrote letters to newspapers in pseu@@ do @-@ on@@ y@@ ms such as Ju@@ ric@@ ol@@ a , Val@@ eri@@ us , Bel@@ is@@ ari@@ us and Por@@ ti@@ us , making up for Washington &apos;s decisions .
in accordance with the historical documents collected under the project to collect letters from George Washington on @-@ line George Washington , he bur@@ ned his c@@ abinet under petitions criticising his views on the friendship , Trade and shipping agreements with Britain .
however , he did not force them to remain silent .
freedom of expression , dis@@ sent and debate are the foundations of our country .
and proper management means accepting it .

&quot; I saw the R@@ ena@@ iss@@ ance C@@ lu@@ b being built , and now we see a club s@@ tun@@ ning in full s@@ oul of this event , &quot; said R@@ aff@@ er@@ ty .
&quot; players see the path as best at their best , it is in a state of excellence .
Jer@@ ry has done an excellent job in building this place .
he is a keen supporter of the gol@@ f game and proud of what he has achieved here .
this will allow an excellent presentation of the path . &quot;
an Eng@@ lis@@ h@@ man ever awa@@ its with interest to be able to defend the title for the first time , even though the man has won both European Toubon and the European challenge Tou@@ l during his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; this is a very special feeling , &quot; said the be@@ ating player in Sou@@ th@@ por@@ t .
&quot; I could not defend my Ex@@ t@@ rema@@ du@@ ra O@@ pen title as it was taken off the competition calendar one year after my victory .
it is bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re to come back to it .
this is an excellent place to play at gol@@ f .
I remember last year &apos;s memor@@ ies , for me and for my wife Shar@@ on , were a special victory for last year .
it was a very special time that we will always have in our hearts . &quot;
G@@ ary Or@@ r will also return to the competition on home soil , who joined the European model of the gen@@ i@@ uses at the beginning of this year when he received 50 .
this is his first event in Scotland since the participation of A@@ ber@@ de@@ en asset Management Scottish O@@ pen@@ il in 2013 .
&quot; it is always a little more meaningful to play at home , &quot; said Hel@@ en@@ s@@ bur@@ gh &apos;s man Or@@ r .
&quot; they are good for the hor@@ ns , but they are also very much more known .
I have enjoyed playing again enormously and I have shown quite a proper gol@@ f game .
I am satisfied with the progress that has been made . &quot;
Tri@@ o will be joined by ian W@@ oo@@ s@@ na@@ m , former MasterCard &apos;s market writer , and Paul Bro@@ ad@@ hur@@ st , Ro@@ ger Chap@@ man , mark James and mark Mc@@ N@@ ul@@ ty .
Or@@ r and former Ry@@ der car@@ ika Cap@@ tain S@@ am Tor@@ om are two out of six Scottish con@@ tests , the rest being Andrew O@@ ld@@ cor@@ n , Ste@@ p@@ hen Mc@@ Allis@@ ter , bill L@@ ong@@ mu@@ ir and ross D@@ ru@@ mon@@ d .
entry is free of charge , and car par@@ king costs a passenger GBP 5 and a car with two or more passengers GBP 10 .
all revenues will go to the Pro@@ state Can@@ er UK , a ch@@ arity .

however , the majority of men in the village may be at risk of being unemployed and many run heavily , plus soldiers .
&apos;@@ nobody da@@ res to go around after 5 o &apos;@@ clock in the village &apos; says .
this is a rare cloud in Papua mä@@ ki , a former Dutch col@@ ony that was added to Indonesia in 19@@ 69 after the referendum that caused controversy , during which only 1 0@@ 26 old people were forced to vote by taking their hands in front of their eyes .
the movement from the upper hand of the Dutch people towards their outra@@ ge against the Y@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta Government , which continues to keep the region under strong control , keeping away foreign journalists and human rights supervisors .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into a P@@ ope and a Western P@@ ope , so that independent Papua New Guinea remained in the east of the island .
to arrive here , 90 minutes from the capital of the province of Ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ur@@ l must be flying within N@@ abi@@ n and then pass a five @-@ hour journey to na@@ vel the ren@@ tal car .
there is no public transport .
a city with around 19 000 inhabitants is made up of t@@ ree houses surrounded by b@@ read@@ cru@@ mb@@ s and covers ru@@ min@@ ant iron ro@@ of@@ s , which have been turned into a different tone into y@@ el@@ low lig@@ ni@@ te .
very few indicators have taken the route here , not to mention the journalists , and almost no foreigners have been here either .

Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line , and inf@@ ant mortality and il@@ literacy statistics are among the worst in Asia .
however , it is also a gold @-@ rich country in Indonesia .
just 100 km from P@@ ani@@ a@@ o , a mountain province of around 153 000 inhabitants in New Jer@@ sey , is the largest and most cost @-@ effective gold mine in the world , G@@ ras@@ berg , a company based in P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x , F@@ re@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an .
in 2015 alone , F@@ Friday exports from here extra@@ cted around USD 3.@@ 1 billion worth of gold and cop@@ per .
in addition , Papua can be proud of the supply of consumer timber with an estimated value of USD 78 billion .
however , these ri@@ ches are the source of the suffering of the boats , as they cause the suff@@ oc@@ ating presence of a powerful Indonesia &apos;s army .
the New York Times study in 2005 showed that between 1998 and 2004 , F@@ Friday &apos;s report paid approximately USD 20 million to local military and military units , including up to USD 150 000 to one of the officers .
P@@ ope &apos;s efforts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this gol@@ den h@@ all and are handled ru@@ th@@ lessly .
according to human rights activists , more than 500 000 boats have been killed since 19@@ 69 and thousands more have been ra@@ ped , tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesia army .
according to the Asian Human Rights Commission , the mass killing of genocide in the 1970s in Papua tri@@ bal moun@@ tains was a measure of genocide .
last year alone , more than 3 900 peaceful protest@@ ors were arrested by the Indonesia police in the area .
the 2016 B@@ ish@@ ops &apos; report &apos; We are all losing &apos; contains testi@@ mony to the atrocities committed in the previous year , such as extra @-@ judicial executions , torture ( another report states that rape and electric shock are particularly common ) and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims because such incidents occur every week , &quot; says the Indonesia research@@ er , Andreas Har@@ son , of Human Rights Watch .
they have been closed down even more strongly , as Papua natural resources have led to the influx of new set@@ tle@@ rs from elsewhere in Indonesia .
83 % of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians , but demo@@ graph@@ ics are changing because of the Muslim economic migrants coming from the islands of Jaa@@ va , Kal@@ im@@ an@@ tan , Su@@ ma@@ tra and S@@ ula@@ w@@ es in Indonesia .
direct pe@@ as@@ ants are selling ga@@ do @-@ ga@@ do @-@ ga@@ do with bal@@ con@@ y and mixed vegetables , which are served along with pe@@ anu@@ ts .
the local authorities cannot compete with them .
&quot; migrants started selling chic@@ k@@ ens and vegetables more cheap@@ ly than local boats on the traditional market , &quot; explain the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Lynne born in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , who moved to Ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ur@@ i , the province &apos;s capital for work .

the President of Indonesia , J@@ ok@@ o W@@ id@@ o@@ do , who is known to be among the people as Jo@@ ko@@ w , pledged in his 2014 election campaign to address these inequalities and human rights violations in P@@ ope .
the former pu@@ mp won 27 constitu@@ encies , including P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , on his way to the presidential Pal@@ ace of J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta in Papua 29 .
but the P@@ ope has changed very little and the local people feel dece@@ ived .
&quot; our hearts have been broken because , in 2014 , we voted in favour of Jo@@ ko@@ w in the expectation that he would fulfil our hopes of restoring justice , &apos; Yes says .
in fact , only two months after Jo@@ ko@@ w took office in October , P@@ ani@@ a@@ i was in a low state .
on 7 December 2014 , 11 children in the majority of the world sta@@ ged on Christmas when two Indonesia soldiers appeared on a motor@@ cycle out of dar@@ k@@ ness .
the inter@@ cep@@ ted children told them that they should include the front lights .
according to what the local pas@@ tor@@ i Y@@ a@@ ve@@ dt T@@ usk said , one of the soldiers insul@@ ted their tone and returned afterwards with four soldiers .
according to the victims and specta@@ tors , soldiers under the influence of drink hun@@ t hun@@ ted children and beaten them with their gun@@ s .
one of the soldiers then shot among the children .
one child , Y@@ u@@ li@@ an@@ us Ye@@ im@@ o , aged 16 , was beaten so coura@@ ge@@ ously that he fell into the Chamber .
a few hours later , the ne@@ ar@@ by electoral Commission building was set on fire and things went on even further the next day .
around 1 000 young men , women and children gathered in order to demand justice in front of the local police station and military control centre .
they carried b@@ reas@@ t@@ ous hun@@ ters and presented Papua me@@ e pa@@ go tri@@ be of wa@@ ita @-@ tan@@ ker , during which a round was drink @-@ and @-@ bu@@ ried s@@ ong .
some prote@@ sters started to roll on the police and the military .
in the wake of the out@@ cry of anger , an order was sent to the soldiers via a sta@@ di@@ um : &apos; when the mass of the population is more than three times resis@@ ting , let them down , &apos; was stated in an official document , which has been seen by the magaz@@ ine on time but has not been issued to local media publications .
in the city of Ke@@ go Ko@@ to , the oldest Ye@@ re@@ mi@@ as Ka@@ y@@ am ( 56 ) , the city of the majority city felt threatened danger and called for peace to be maintained by asking for the population to go home .
nobody wanted to listen .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen I was suddenly shot in the left , &apos; said to the magaz@@ ine in his private colour on the ver@@ ge of the t@@ ree .
we still do not know who the fir@@ mer was , but say that the month came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered .
&apos;@@ There was a lot of people , there were plenty of las@@ ts in the industry , &apos; he adds .
Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w , a local man , has seen his shooting on three occasions , according to a need@@ le .
&quot; I would come to him and look through his body to make sure it is with him , &quot; said the magaz@@ ine at length in Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who , like many econ@@ omis@@ ts , use only one name .
&apos;@@ I saw that he has died ... I saw him &apos; .
Papua police chief inspe@@ ctor Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ aks told repor@@ ters that he only guaranteed the security of his department because it was attacked .
&quot; we need to protect ourselves when we are threatened with killing , &quot; said P@@ ud@@ jo S@@ ul@@ is@@ ti@@ yo , Commissioner for Police S@@ ul@@ is@@ ti@@ yo in 2015 .
&apos;@@ This is a matter of life and death &apos; .
according to Human Rights Watch , five young protest@@ ors were killed and there were many injured .
the news of the killings only reached J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta the next day .
three weeks later , Jo@@ ko@@ w Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ ra made a passion@@ ate speech expressing sympathy to the families of the victims and promising to deal with abuses in P@@ ope .
&quot; I want to resolve this case immediately so that it never happens again in the future , &quot; he said .
Mr W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , Minister for Security , said in October 2016 that he would put in place an alternative mechanism for resolving crimes against human rights .
but the ex@@ cus@@ es almost immediately followed .
&quot; most crimes happened a long time ago .
some of them took place in the 1990s and early 200@@ 0s .
the point is that we are committed to resolving these crimes , but we have to follow certain processes , &apos; he said .
speaking at the time on 5 June in J@@ ak@@ ar@@ tas , W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , however , took his words back , saying that he had no intention of creating a P@@ ope mechanism to deal with complaints .
instead , he said , &apos; everything is done according to the law &apos; .
W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , accused by the UN of crimes against human rights , of deaths of more than 1 000 people in East Timor during the bloody referendum in 1999 , said that 11 crimes against human rights had already been resolved in P@@ ope , including in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
the families of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i victims accepted such claims with g@@ loom@@ y mistrust .
&quot; I have been inter@@ ro@@ gated four times over the last three years , but there has been no progress , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&apos;@@ I am ti@@ red &apos; .
he says that years later , he still lives in fear .
&apos;@@ I am afraid , &apos; he says .
&apos;@@ I am afraid the army is ar@@ resting me , I am afraid I am being shot &apos; .
his bro@@ ther Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us confirmed the view that the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i people are afraid of s@@ mel@@ ting this incident .
he said that he had got a head from the army after helping to bur@@ y four victims .
&apos;@@ E@@ ven after bur@@ ying the bodies , the army had to seek me , &apos; he says .
the arrests have not stopped .
on Tuesday in D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ is , the people of Indonesia &apos;s village district of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i were shot by the police .
one person was killed and 17 injured , including children , when it went to war between the head of the village population and the head of the construction company , who refused to transport an un@@ conscious man to hospital .
this man &apos;s people , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ iku@@ an@@ us D@@ ou@@ w , who dro@@ w@@ ned into a ne@@ ar@@ by river when trying to fish , died on his way to hospital .
the blind village people prote@@ sted at the construction site at the office of the company .
according to the police , village people st@@ oned poli@@ ce@@ men , the latter responded with warning bel@@ ls .
however , according to local claims , mobile Bri@@ tons ( police deployed in Indonesia ) started fir@@ ing at the people , killing one person .
&apos;@@ We were in great panic , we are afraid of re@@ tali@@ ation , &apos; said the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ ge Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near hospital and saw the in@@ take of the injured .
&apos;@@ I have beaten myself in my own house for two days &apos; .
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ i Parliament has called for the police involved to be held accountable and for the police to be withdrawn from the region by the mobile bri@@ gade .
lead has always been a problem for the Government of Indonesia .
the lack of meaningful development fe@@ eds the dis@@ satisfaction of the honey , m@@ one , South and Sudanese tri@@ bes living in Papua hal@@ i@@ but medium @-@ mountainous lands .
many of them have joined the F@@ ed@@ era@@ tive army of free Papua ( V@@ PL ) re@@ bels , which , according to its own words , protects the rights of boats by appalling attacks and kid@@ napp@@ ings on the part of the Indonesia soldiers .
some V@@ PL leaders come from P@@ ani@@ a@@ o , including Ta@@ di@@ us Y@@ o@@ g and Daniel Y@@ u@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response , in recent years , under the pretext of &apos; defending state sovereignty &apos; , the army has been ar@@ resting in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i and arbitrarily ar@@ resting thousands of people .
some of them will never appear again .
P@@ ani@@ a@@ des are known as &apos; a tragic forgotten place &apos; among Papua people .
poverty fe@@ eds dis@@ satisfaction .
the low ri@@ ce that is sold in the majority of the whe@@ el is too expensive for local purchase .
I find the same un@@ at@@ tain@@ able .
people themselves grow their entire food online mainly on the basis of b@@ read@@ cru@@ mb@@ s , as well as some fruit and vegetables .
farming is a job for women , each of whom can care for four or five ba@@ seline fields .
they usually keep most of the harvest in the family , the rest being sold on the local market .
ten ba@@ tes cost only 10 000 Indonesia &apos;s premises ( 75 cents ) .
over time , economic inequality has been exacerbated between the indigenous boats and the new migrants , who have come a great deal since the opening of new routes at N@@ ab@@ ire Air@@ port .
the few jobs that exist are going to better educated and richer migrants .
the P@@ ope himself often lacks the capital or the necessary skills to conduct a competitive business .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village because there are no jobs or money here , &quot; says John Go@@ ba@@ i , President of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i tri@@ be Council .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from the P@@ ope .
in addition , strict restrictions remain on foreign media .
earlier this year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le L@@ ong@@ cha@@ mp were expelled from P@@ ope because &apos; they did not follow relevant practices &apos; , even though they had been granted a rare film authorisation .
according to P@@ ord@@ m K@@ ine , Deputy head of the Department of Asia for Human Rights Watch , the election promises made by Jo@@ ko@@ w have not been carried out to lift the restrictions on reports to promote transparency and development .
&apos;@@ In Indonesia , journalists trying to report in Papua most Eastern provinces and Western P@@ ope , are threatened by new threats to the rejection of the interoperability visa and the listing of the black list , &apos; he said in his statement .
the lack of a look at the press means that international pressure on the government of Indonesia is largely limited to Papua a@@ o &apos;s immediate neighbours .
in March , six of the Pacific States encouraged them to examine the &apos; United Nations Human Rights Council in Ukraine on a wide range of scale crimes &apos; , including the shooting of P@@ ani@@ a@@ o , along with Na@@ ur@@ u , B@@ ela@@ u , Tu@@ pain , the Mar@@ shall Islands and the Sol@@ om@@ on Islands .
these same countries have also historically supported V@@ PL .
Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , spokes@@ person for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia , dismissed the group &apos;s accusations , saying to the press in J@@ ak@@ ar@@ tas : &apos; democratic order still exists in Indonesia and freedom of the press , so that evidence of cases of human rights would be hard to bur@@ y &apos; .
the local people want more foreign governments to be noted .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the country &apos;s human rights Envoy , Mr Van B@@ ar , visited Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ ra on 4 May , the local people interrupted their silence , according to the source that they wanted to be anon@@ ymous , urging : &apos; we want freedom &apos; .
in Indonesia , new presidential elections will take place in 2019 , but boats do not believe they will vote for Jo@@ ko@@ w again .
Jo@@ ko@@ w is a man of good intentions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in shooting at P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , says Ho@@ ba@@ i , President of the tri@@ bal Council .
he wants to tell Jo@@ ko@@ w not only that the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i live under the threat of a constantly pre@@ da@@ tory army , but they are struggling with misery due to poor education and health services .
according to Go@@ ba@@ i , the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , like other boats , regard their vote to Jo@@ ko@@ w as their debt to be paid .
&apos;@@ The@@ y do not need money , they want justice , &apos; he says .
despite threats and intimidation , the families of the victims of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i bom@@ bing managed to cope with the last symbolic revol@@ t in front of the victim &apos;s body of police stations and the military bases responded to the land in question .
knowing that justice may never be put on its feet , they will at least not allow those responsible to forget their crimes .
&apos;@@ One of our family members was killed , &apos; says the head of Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us who was fel@@ led .
&apos;@@ What else can we do ? &apos;
come under the cl@@ ou@@ ds of Du@@ ba@@ i Tor@@ ch for the second time !
on Friday , hundreds of inhabitants were forced to fle@@ e from this 3@@ 37 me@@ ters de@@ ser@@ t and 79 ti@@ dal buildings through one of the world &apos;s highest residential tow@@ ers in Du@@ ba@@ i .
this is the second fire that has ra@@ va@@ ged the High Representative for just two years , which happens to be called Tu@@ rin , or T@@ rus@@ vi@@ ku@@ p .
no direct fire was evacu@@ ated , no injuries were reported and no direct fire was caused .
&quot; we s@@ le@@ ep and wake up to fires and people sh@@ ou@@ ting .
we would be travelling down the sta@@ irs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &apos; said Re@@ u@@ ters a resident who called himself George .
according to Du@@ ba@@ i civil protection officials , fire @-@ fighters also deleted the site at around 4 a.m. in the morning at local time ( 00@@ .00 G@@ MT ) and ref@@ ra@@ ined the building .
the government said that it was working to provide shelter to the victims .
this incident may once again raise questions about the safety of high @-@ cal@@ ib@@ re materials used across the world .
an investigation carried out in the wake of the 2015 Tu@@ ch Management Board found that the most damage was caused by the fa@@ ç@@ a@@ des of fa@@ ç@@ a@@ des , the dec@@ or@@ ative panels and isolation of external soil .
the British police have said that they believe that the isolation of the London G@@ ren@@ er T@@ ow@@ er and the fa@@ ç@@ ade could contribute to the rapid spread of the fire that occurred there in June , killing around 80 people .
see : these phones are expected to become sales sites in the autumn
complex and autumn is the time for technical Afgh@@ ans to display their new models of excellence .
in the spring , Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , Hu@@ aw@@ ei P@@ 10 and S@@ ony X@@ peri@@ a Pre@@ mi@@ um came for sale , and in the autumn too , new h@@ it@@ t @-@ phones are expected for boys .
&quot; thanks to the television 2 marketing and sale Director , CS@@ jan Se@@ mother , this year &apos;s flag@@ ships are characterised by an innovative design , an eye @-@ h@@ all , a screen with 4@@ K resolution on the ser@@ ver @-@ servan@@ i , and a super @-@ fast process manager .
in the technological world , Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 has created a great deal of ex@@ ci@@ tement , which has also reached the top of the sale table for smart phones in Estonia .
the autumn will allow even more ti@@ red re@@ charging , more resilient bat@@ tery , better quality camer@@ as and greater water and pollin@@ ation for smart citizens .
he added that the rum@@ ours were already able to specu@@ late and predict four top @-@ level models that will probably con@@ qu@@ er the streets .
these four top models for smar@@ t@@ phones will still be reached by the bo@@ xes in the autumn of this year .
the long @-@ awaited i@@ P@@ hone 8 and i@@ P@@ hone 8 Plus should reach the boys as early as mid @-@ September .
there is a lot of growth in the rum@@ ours that the new Apple model looks at and what it can do .
while the i@@ P@@ hone 7 did not bring about significant differences along with the i@@ P@@ hone 6@@ s , on the occasion of Apple &apos;s 10th birth@@ day , it is expected that the new model will be completely different from previous ones .
four pa@@ ints have been mentioned : black , white , rosé gold and ch@@ ro@@ mi@@ um .
one of the elements of the new design is probably the screen , which covers the entire telephone head@@ way , has lost the dog and the finger@@ print read@@ ers have been built on the screen .
J@@ on@@ y@@ I@@ ve , the head of design of Apple , is demanding that the new i@@ P@@ hone model look like a glass .
there has also been talk of an i@@ P@@ hone C@@ era@@ mic version .
in addition to the horizon , the un@@ man@@ age@@ able re@@ charge and a much higher quality camer@@ a can be expected to be faster than A@@ 11 processes .
surely this is one year &apos;s most anticipated smar@@ t@@ phones .
the outs@@ ourcing of the brand new model G@@ ala@@ x@@ y rou@@ 8 begins on 23 August .
there have been many rum@@ ours about what the new G@@ ala@@ x@@ y rou@@ 8 will look like .
I am hearing that even more business users have been targeted , and the S pen provides even greater fun@@ ction@@ ality .
the phone should have two camer@@ as , one being a la@@ isse@@ z @-@ j@@ er@@ k and the other being television object with a narro@@ wer view .
no one knows yet what the two tab@@ oo@@ s can be , but in any case this is Sam@@ sun@@ g &apos;s first test , which is certainly comparable in terms of quality to that of i@@ P@@ hone 8 .
however , we are looking forward to 23 August .
although Nokia has brought three smart phones to sale this year , headed by Nokia 6 , there is still a shortage of their flag@@ ships , Nokia 8 , which are already to be presented on 16 August .
we expect a screen stret@@ ching from No@@ ki@@ an to 5.@@ 3 p.m. and an extremely rapid Qu@@ al@@ com@@ m S@@ kar@@ dra@@ g@@ on 8@@ 35 procedural processes and more durable bat@@ tery .
Nokia also talks about alu@@ mini@@ um cor@@ ps and about a significant level of water and pollin@@ ation in IP@@ 68 .
like Sam@@ su@@ ng@@ i , the new model of Nokia has two tab@@ oo@@ s , an opti@@ mist produced by Z@@ e@@ iss .
if the flag vessel of S@@ ony has been X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um so far , the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smart phones with even more innovative functions will soon be included .
we are waiting for a smar@@ t@@ phone that is slightly more modest than X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um , but at least just as good or better as a camer@@ a .
regarding the new model of the S@@ ony , there has been speculation that the screen is at least hot .
what reality will bring us to see very soon , as S@@ ony has traditionally unve@@ iled its autumn flag ship at IF@@ A , the International Technology F@@ air , which is due to take place this year from 1 to 6 September .
T@@ ru@@ mp Mexico was pres@@ su@@ ris@@ ed for paying for the border wall , according to trans@@ cri@@ c@@ ers le@@ ak@@ ed telephone calls .
the Washington post unve@@ iled trans@@ cri@@ ptions of telephone calls between US President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i and Mexic@@ an and Austr@@ alian heads of state .
on 27 January , T@@ ru@@ mp &apos;s telephone call addressed to Mexic@@ an President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ et@@ o to stop pro@@ claiming that he did not intend to pay for the proposed border wall .
he was crus@@ hed by the American President for publicly condemning the Wall , saying : &apos; you must not say this to the press &apos; .
T@@ ru@@ mp raised his presidential campaign &apos;s promise of building a long border wall and an age @-@ old wall in the United States to make Mexico pay for this project .
it also published trans@@ cri@@ ptions of his first speech with the Austr@@ alian Prime Minister , Malcolm Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l , which reveal an intense exchange of views .
T@@ ru@@ mp told Tur@@ n that the agreement by the United States of America to take in refugees to Australia was &apos; ridiculous &apos; , &apos; ner@@ v@@ ous &apos; and &apos; stu@@ pid &apos; ; he said that the agreement reached under the Obama Government would give him the impression of a &apos; guide &apos; , as he has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States .
the T@@ ru@@ mp concluded by informing the Tur@@ ner that &apos; it was the day &apos;s most un@@ pleasant speech &apos; .
the state court did not prosecute the city of Li@@ ines , the city of O@@ C MR@@ P , for having rejected their offer for the procurement of bus services between July 2019 and 20@@ 29 .
it is a letter of order rejecting the offer made by the city of Li@@ ines to the city of O@@ C MR@@ P at the Tar@@ tu bus service because the offer did not meet the requirements , An@@ 4 A@@ pu@@ tin , President of the Tar@@ tu City Law Service , explained .
it is a procurement of public bus services within the city of Tar@@ tu for a period of 0@@ 1.@@ 0@@ 7.@@ 2019 @-@ 3@@ 0.@@ 0@@ 6.@@ 20@@ 29 .
the city of Li@@ ines of MR@@ P has taken a ruling before the Supreme Court of Justice of Tar@@ tu .
it was not prosecuted by the national court .
although many in the social media complain that their night is distur@@ bed by the We@@ ek@@ end festi@@ val and that the whole city is full of d@@ run@@ k brak@@ es , there are also many who do not have any bad words about the ongoing festi@@ val on the floor .
I am even positively surprised that the super@@ market had such a cour@@ tes@@ y !
I did not see any mis@@ gi@@ vings or mis@@ cour@@ tes@@ y .
even left , I saw a res@@ ounding wave .
&quot; it &apos;s all very well to have come , to be and to be happy with the Per@@ sian E@@ ag@@ le , which is like the w@@ ag@@ ons of winter , &quot; he is happy to add .
the s@@ le@@ an@@ ing wave of rub@@ b@@ ish does not b@@ other .
while he still heard in a central town that music would be played on the be@@ ach , music has not yet reached his home inten@@ tional level .
&quot; but I hope I hear , he says che@@ er@@ fully .
the discussion in Ag@@ nes also shows that the Grand F@@ esti@@ val is rather good for Per@@ sian , because it contributes greatly to the turnover of local merchan@@ ts .
in addition , he welcomes the fact that the village has come to such an extent .
the woman of family me@@ als has no difficulty .
although I am no longer on the floor , it is nice that the be@@ ach has revi@@ ved .
and it is good that the people are moving , and that has been the case three times now &apos; , a woman says .
I think the first time was perhaps a little worse .
&apos;@@ Wel@@ l , maybe there were complaints &apos; , he is wondering .
however , he said that what is happening on the be@@ ach was normal for the summer capital cities .
&apos;@@ This We@@ ek@@ end is a very good pro@@ mo for our small city &apos; , speaks of Har@@ r on board .
neither has M@@ ho@@ ever and m@@ ö@@ ll s@@ pared his life .
but for you ?
we should all make savings .
think about how this inter @-@ ethnic communication would be better .
the man of music is not d@@ aring .
it does not work , although I live near it .
&apos;@@ G@@ ood people can make savings and there is no mis@@ fortune &apos; , he speaks .
visitors who have arrived in Per@@ sian are poli@@ te , as he said .
&quot; with bot@@ tles they have , of course , over@@ taken them a little , but young people are young and young God - give you a hand , but be people and do it ! &apos; he says .
the coastal population has travelled somewhere by then , whether to relatives or acqu@@ ain@@ tan@@ ces .
&quot; but in general , the festi@@ val has a positive impact on life - people like this me@@ al , &quot; Ti@@ ina , who speaks to children with Per@@ nus .
his family &apos;s und festi@@ val is not bo@@ thered either , although last year it was even more so than this one .
last summer there was another stage , then we heard more .
we live out of the city itself that it actually runs quite well off the coast of the Per@@ sian River . &quot;
Pe@@ ar@@ son cuts another 3 000 jobs and reduces dividen@@ ds to revita@@ lise business
the British education company Pe@@ ar@@ son said on Friday that it would cut another 3 000 jobs and reduce its intermediate dividen@@ ds by 72 % , thereby launching another restructuring programme to deal with the threat to business .
the jobs to be protected , as John F@@ all@@ on , the CE@@ O said , will most likely be concentrated at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , will be added to the 4 000 posts lost during the previous restructuring .
Pe@@ ar@@ son announced plans in May to cut costs by another GBP 300 million ( USD 3@@ 94 million ) under the third expenditure reduction programme in order to try to revive a business that has been hit by the transition to rapid digital learning .
the company , which agreed to sell last month on its partner company Pen@@ gu@@ in R@@ and@@ om House , Ber@@ tel@@ s@@ mann , said that their expectation of a year has not changed since a 1 % increase in sales profits was announced in the first half of the year to GBP 2.@@ 05 billion .
Sunday , the summer of the ra@@ in@@ y season continues to sound s@@ tun@@ t .
in Estonia , with the ra@@ in@@ y season on Sunday , there will be a sil@@ ver weather coming from the summer , and there will be some very strong out@@ breaks .

there are tor@@ ren@@ tial ra@@ inf@@ all on several sides , perhaps from the f@@ ring@@ es .
there is an outbreak of up to 14 , islands and coast@@ lines of up to 18 m .

K@@ abu@@ l : a suicide attack killed a NATO soldi@@ er
the suicide bom@@ ber , according to the officials , attacked military con@@ vo@@ ys in the Afghan capital , K@@ abu@@ l , killing a NATO soldi@@ er and w@@ ounding several others .
the NATO statement said that five soldiers and interpreters were injured .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians were killed in an incident in the town &apos;s Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ hi square .
this bom@@ bing is the last of the acts of violence that have struck Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in the Her@@ at mos@@ que attack .
on Monday , two people were killed by a suicide bom@@ ber in K@@ abu@@ l , near the Iraqi E@@ mb@@ assy .
the statement by NATO said that there was an explosion on Thursday evening when joint pat@@ ro@@ ls with the Afghan army were attacked &apos; with a man @-@ made explo@@ sive body &apos; .
the statement states that everything is in a stable position and that it will be treated in a US military hospital on Bag@@ ra@@ m airport .
according to reports , the ever @-@ growing forces in Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ hi , the Taliban and group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State in Bag@@ ra@@ i , are a source of serious concern to NATO forces in Bag@@ ra@@ m .
according to the UN , at least 16@@ 62 civilians have died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , of whom nearly 20 % in the capital city .
at the end of July , the car bomb in K@@ abu@@ l killed at least 30 people , mainly in the S@@ hi &apos;@@ ite line .
according to the Taliban , they were behind the attack .
on 31 May , a major bomb attack killed more than 150 people in the centre of the city - the most deadly military attack in the country since the US @-@ led forces rejected the Taliban in 2001 .
this violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , while the President of the United States Donald T@@ ru@@ mp is considering increasing the number of US troops helping the country &apos;s army and police .
according to reports from reports , suicide attacks in K@@ abu@@ l in recent weeks have also led to a public crisis of confidence in the government , its policies and , in particular , its President , Ashraf G@@ h@@ an .
the EPA subsequently annul@@ led the decision to postpone the summer regulation .
the United States Environment Protection Agency ( United States Environmental Protection Agency ) annul@@ led its decision to delay the introduction of a Obama regulation obli@@ ging states to limit emissions from the summer , one day after 15 states were brought to court due to this move .
the EPA announced the decision to proceed &apos; 2015 with procedures to determine the content of ozone &apos; late on Wednesday , saying that it shows the Agency &apos;s commitment to cooperating with the states .
&quot; we believe that we need to engage in dialogue and listen to our state partners , &quot; said Scot@@ t P@@ ru@@ it@@ t , the head of the EPA .
P@@ ru@@ it was announced in June by the EPA &apos;s intention to postpone the ozone content levels in interoperability in order to measure pollution in various parts of the country in order to determine where this level should be reduced by one year until 2018 in order to meet the highest air quality standard .
the 15 main democratic states , together with the Colom@@ bian community , brought an action on Tuesday , saying that this decision was illegal .
President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s government has tried to pull back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama , which , according to the ru@@ mp@@ ire , are part of a more comprehensive plan for revi@@ ving economic growth .
however , these efforts have provoked reactions among the democrats and natural conservation groups who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health .
the EPA website states that brea@@ thing an air with ozone can &apos; reduce lun@@ g working capacity and increase the risk of res@@ pira@@ tory diseases &apos; , for example as@@ th@@ ma .
German pigs may come from a pi@@ pe .
German pigs and cattle may be caught because heavy rain jeopardis@@ es the catch of the second largest wheat producer in the European Union , B@@ is@@ berg wri@@ tes .
this year , it can be the case that weeks before harvest can mean that fruit intended for bread can only eat animals .
&quot; the quality of the content is far worse than the soil and worse than in 2015 , &quot; said the A@@ gra@@ vis R@@ ai@@ ff@@ e@@ is@@ en analy@@ sts , Mr Rap@@ hard Sea .
this year , up to 40 % of German wheat for animal feed , which is from food to normal , was forecast in A@@ gra@@ v .
German farmers , like their European colleagues , have come across all sorts of weather this year .
first of all , the winter was too dry .
then came the spring , which was replaced by he@@ at@@ wave in June .
in July , Germany hit the German sa@@ ils , which have continued in August .
many eyes are on Northern Germany , where the rain hin@@ ders harves@@ ting .
so far , only five per cent of wheat has been repeated .
most of the region has not even reached the MSY level , announced by the bu@@ yer of the local harvest in C@@ era@@ vis .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at is quite a difficult day &apos; , said Frank Dec@@ ker@@ t R@@ end@@ s@@ burg , a senior trader in C@@ era@@ vis .
consistency in everything , in other words , the so@@ ber ro@@ cks of internal design for Fin@@ ns
in Ka@@ un@@ ia , nature plays its part in the Internet n@@ ights , because through large win@@ dows the equ@@ ated views of the Sa@@ ima@@ a fishermen reach many of the rooms ( life ) .
every step in the face of the aspi@@ ration of our northern neighbours to create both strong and perfect ( energy @-@ saving ) homes .
the ability to use the timber of Fin@@ ns as construction and processing materials , fur@@ ni@@ ture and beau@@ ty are also worthy of compliance .
virtual techniques and smart solutions can be found in cha@@ mbers , both in the construction and in the ( home ) de@@ sig@@ ner .
it is clear there that the composition of black , white and grey chains , if they are supplemented by wood labels and food plants , can be very desperate .
there are still some good ideas open for a week to come , as the F@@ air will last until 13 August .
suppliers and her@@ bs suggest that this kit@@ chen is often cop@@ ied .
today &apos;s drawing line is down to We@@ ek@@ end F@@ esti@@ val Baltic@@ a and Martin Garriga has done his utmost to remember the latter as the last speaker .
the people were really turning around when Mr Garriga was present - the s@@ ong , the s@@ ong , the air , the dan@@ cing force .
when Garriga x ended , a single mass of Per@@ sian be@@ ach was spread over the city .

M@@ ain@@ y Gar@@ cia and V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss possible confrontation
V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko and M@@ ain@@ y Gar@@ cia , who should be on the col@@ lisi@@ on course to face up to the most attractive bo@@ xing category of bo@@ xing in the near future , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t , at the office of the ES@@ P@@ N , in L@@ OS An@@ ge@@ les , as long as Gar@@ cia , the un@@ won World Bo@@ diplomatic Coun@@ c@@ il &apos;s ligh@@ t@@ we@@ ights , wal@@ ked to the other end of the corridor to welcome L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t , the World Bo@@ main@@ z@@ ation@@ i sul@@ g@@ yn@@ ch .
after the unanimous decision of Gar@@ cia , both comb@@ at@@ ants are at the forefront of the weigh@@ ty table five following the victory of the former four @-@ time world champi@@ ons , Adri@@ en B@@ ron@@ er .
Ms Gar@@ cia extended her better hand and said , &apos; Ho@@ w does you go , champion ?
I wish you every success . &quot;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko protects his bel@@ ts against Miguel Mar@@ ries on Saturday evening at 19 ES@@ P@@ N .
when a couple of pho@@ tos were available , the Mayor of L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko , E@@ gis Climate , stated that there would be a &apos; perfect measurement &apos; of the confrontation between the fighters .
&quot; I am a former consul@@ tant , &quot; recalled by Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I rise for B@@ ron@@ ger &#91; to 6@@ 3.5 kg &#93; , but I am not so large .
I am small for 6@@ 3.5 kg .
I want to move below the weight of relief .
and it must move up the weight of &#91; 6@@ 1.2 kg &#93; and then we can fight .
F@@ ans have asked for this .
let us then offer them it . &apos;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko agreed .
&apos;@@ The bo@@ xing world needs this fight &apos; .
( es ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the climate raised the question of whether it should be cost @-@ effective , as part of his strategy of allowing L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ l to debate at the end of this year a class of 6@@ 1.2 kg to make it possible for next summer to meet with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 no@@ ses ) , who also has an interest in combating Jor@@ ge L@@ in@@ are@@ se and Lu@@ ke Cam@@ p@@ bel@@ l &apos;s winner after their ligh@@ t@@ weight title in For@@ u@@ l on 23 September .
&quot; looking at this fight could be cost @-@ effective , as f@@ ans have asked for this confrontation , &quot; said Gar@@ cia later , saying that he was open to fighting any channel that offers the best financial package .
&quot; we are the main actors .
no other name can attract so much attention .
whenever they are prepared ... &apos;
Gar@@ cia said that he considered L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t to be a &apos; powerful figh@@ ter &apos; and could go on to see his match from Saturday to Saturday .
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko , however , was modest in pra@@ ising Gar@@ cia when he said that he thought that the champion of the three di@@ vis@@ u@@ als from Ri@@ ver@@ side was &apos; very slow ; sorry , M@@ ain@@ y ... you wanted this no@@ vel@@ s &apos; .
according to Gar@@ cia , the aim was to show strength and then to po@@ cket .
both confirmed that they felt the increased tension between them in order to try to get there .
&quot; this is a fight that we need to make a reality .
no other confrontation aro@@ uses so much attention and attention .
I am more than willing to work towards this , &apos; said Gar@@ cia .
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko said : &apos; I have been waiting for the best fighters , and M@@ ain@@ y has just been .
this will be a good fight . &quot;
which world cor@@ ners are moving to Estonia ?
last year , the Police and Border Guard ( PP@@ A ) granted a record number of over 13 000 residence permits to third @-@ country nationals who have largely travelled to Estonia for work , study or family .
when , for example , a fixed @-@ term residence permit was decided on last year for 6@@ 7@@ 02 foreigners , this figure was 4@@ 9@@ 28 .
the services cannot tell how many immigrants will eventually remain permanently in Estonia , but such an analysis will be prepared in the Ministry of the Interior .
while nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia ten years ago , in recent years , the figure is close to 2 000 .
the number of applicants for residence permits increased dramatically during the Ukrainian crisis , with 10@@ 87 fixed @-@ term residence permits in 2014 , up from 6@@ 75 in 2014 .
according to statistical data , the largest number of Ukrainian citizens is growing in Estonia , with 850 Ukrainian citizens arriving in Estonia last night more than leaving .
&quot; the Ukrainian community has always been big in Estonia and , due to difficult circumstances , it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many families are already facing it , &quot; said Kris@@ tin Ram@@ mus , spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Interior .
in total , the number of Ukrainians granted a fixed @-@ term residence permit was higher than the number of Russian citizens , even though in 10 years , it is the latter who have had the most fixed @-@ term residence permits issued .
when Ukrainians largely come to work here , Russian citizens for family migration .
&apos;@@ G@@ iv@@ en the historical Russian community here , they are also most likely to have the greatest family ties with people living in Russia &apos; , said Hel@@ ina Me@@ ing , an internal migratory theat@@ re .
&apos;@@ I@@ f you look at where Russian citizens who have been granted a residence permit in Estonia have moved to , after Har@@ t@@ land , Eastern Vir@@ u@@ ony &apos; , he added and pointed out that around 40 % of them had mar@@ ried with a European Union citizen .
the soil received a fixed @-@ term residence permit of 16@@ 96 Russian citizens , which is also a record number .
at the same time , the number of Russians who wanted to extend their residence permit decreased .
&quot; compensation is the result of a new residence permit permanently intended for Estonia instead of extending its residence permit , &quot; said Ram@@ mus , spokes@@ person of the Ministry of the Interior , who said that the interest of Russian citizens in Estonia &apos;s residence permit has remained stable for years .
the new residence permit for Estonia will allow foreigners who have lived here for at least three years to apply for it since last year .
its aim is to encourage the sincere saving of people who have adapted .
however , a long @-@ term resident permit requires , for example , five years .
the extension of the old residence permit has obviously also decreased because of the new residence permit .
last night , for example , such residence permits were granted to Ukrainians , who have been working here for at least three years .
the Ukrainians can now change their jobs , and the Estonian state is no longer pointing the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met .
this residence permit became a lever - last year &apos;s applicants were holders of a grey passport ( 10@@ 29 ) , Russians ( 4@@ 87 ) , Indi@@ ans ( 54 ) and Romanians ( 36 ) .
in total , 19@@ 68 people were granted a residence permit to live in Estonia , including 23 Americans , 12 Egypti@@ ans , 18 Georgi@@ ans and as many Chinese , for example .
this first half of this year , the total number of such applicants is already 12@@ 69 .
for 10 years , Nigeria has become , surpris@@ ingly , one of the most active citizens of the Estonian residence permit .
when three residence permits were issued to young people in 2007 , the soil was 200 .
Nigeria comes to learn from universities here .
higher education institutions in Estonia are also popular with Georgi@@ ans , Chinese and Tur@@ ks , for example .
the number of citizens from India , Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen largely thanks to learning games .
for them , too , the rule is that where the community has arisen , there will be more easily to others , &quot; Ram@@ mus added .
for 10 years , two people have also moved to Estonia from , for example , North Korea , just as much from La@@ os and Madagascar .
ten people have come here from Cuba , 2@@ 31 from South Korea , 40 from Indonesia and four from U@@ ru@@ guay .
if around 6 000 third @-@ country nationals receive a residence permit per year , that is about 0.@@ 46 % of the total population .
even if we add to the citizens of the European Union , migration remains about a percentage , &quot; said Me@@ use that , in fact , the numbers were small .
in total , 14 8@@ 22 people travelled to Estonia according to the statistical office , out of which 13 7@@ 92 .
this means that immigration has over@@ taken another year &apos;s emigration .
most of those who are out and moving are Estonian citizens , but there are more of them leaving .
as a result , Estonian citizens &apos; migratory bub@@ ble with 2 000 people was in decline .
Est@@ oni@@ ans , in particular , travel between Finland and Estonia .
the P@@ rin@@ ce of M@@ ong C@@ ou@@ ture tri@@ cks with sa@@ ts , chic@@ k@@ ens and swe@@ et sl@@ ope
in the Gulf of Northern ideas , however , there is a history for Maria Tampere - an old set of pa@@ int@@ ings and defen@@ dants : &apos; for hours , I can dream somewhere in a muse@@ um and ad@@ m@@ ire old @-@ age thi@@ ev@@ es and cra@@ ts .
if you take a hard line , you will study it and learn it every day .
that is a joy of disco@@ very !
the M@@ ong C@@ ou@@ ture gla@@ mo@@ rous world may seem like a life @-@ alien , but the de@@ sig@@ ner does not think so .
you yourselves decide how much you have in your life !
as a friend , I have a whole sa@@ un full of my shar@@ ks of cou@@ ture .
because it is not his fault that he does not live in Hol@@ ly@@ wood and does not go to the red horse every day ; he also wants to wear those most beautiful bro@@ thers , and that is what he is suffering !
you yourself can live your life special !
the Mo@@ e@@ ar@@ tist does not recognise the gap between sh@@ ining events and bad day .
it was this reasoning that led to the rolling @-@ out of the plan to bring the high @-@ profile in Estonia between rural areas , forests and fields , to people who often do not reach .
for example , a collection of me@@ long colle@@ ctions was presented in comparison , J@@ air and Per@@ ka mo@@ e@@ alle@@ el , where the Ro@@ yal dec@@ fi@@ les with 45 mo@@ del@@ s filled the entire street .
in Tallinn , you are often taken in in the shop , no@@ d@@ ding with dignity , but elsewhere there are more emo@@ tions : sh@@ ou@@ ting b@@ Bra@@ vo , rising up ; you want to thank you with com@@ passion .
a large proportion of the audience had to be news just like that , but now they are the M@@ ong C@@ ou@@ ture f@@ ans .
if you live up to the expectations of the people , they are over@@ jo@@ yed !
and I like the feeling that I am with my fashion at the summer rec@@ ess .
Per@@ nus had a 50 @-@ me@@ tre red car@@ pet , full of rub@@ b@@ ish along the street , seemed not to have come to an end !
Maria also does not recognise the mo@@ tive that creation must be presented by a super@@ sta@@ ll ; she will be happy to bring about ordinary women .
I often invite my own customers - they have always been happy .
this is the la@@ x of experience , you have found the stage on a wonderful note !
I am so sorry that I myself have never seen my play ; after all , I am always behind the shel@@ f in order to give things the last but@@ ton as a hope@@ less ac@@ tion@@ ist .
my ner@@ ve would not allow a peaceful eye to be held on the floor .
Maria is the ar@@ tist of this kind , who not only wants to play a representative role , but also to be present in everything .
I have my mes@@ h machine on the radio , most of the colle@@ ctions being carried out myself .
I like the whole process where you played with details , find out .
I am never far removed from my nature and I am not afraid of work .
it is not a matter of isolation , nor is it a matter of style , logistics , organisation , organisation , organisation - it is all about the day of a woman who is we@@ aring one of his or her cor@@ ps .
for these hours of work , the fana@@ tics are still doing a huge amount .
I cannot say when my working day will end , but for me it is simply a day of joy !
I am still very lu@@ cky - it is like an un@@ ce@@ asing happy happy circle : I do something beautiful , man gets something beautiful and , in turn , compli@@ ments .
several times , it has been said that my bro@@ thers have a natural t@@ reas@@ ure : they make themselves feel like a pr@@ inc@@ ess .
the generous , dis@@ gus@@ ting cru@@ ci@@ fi@@ xes that made Maria talent in@@ audi@@ ble overnight have sta@@ yed until now in the form of C@@ ou@@ ture signals .
Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ p of U@@ 18 boys : the weapon of the Est@@ oni@@ ans &apos; al@@ ag@@ ro@@ pi@@ um was now turned against us .
it is a shame , a fa@@ iry tale , that ran out .
the first thing that came to light was that we were not able to get our s@@ ong on our des@@ ks .
and when there is such a big difference to be made on the table , &quot; Estonia commented on U@@ 18 cor@@ v@@ pal@@ li@@ ans 61 : 75 absten@@ tions for Britain &apos;s only Kor@@ v@@ pal@@ lo@@ r , BC Kal@@ e@@ v / Cra@@ mo ab@@ it@@ re@@ en@@ er Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ p .
opponents took 28 bal@@ ls out of the attack and , as a result , received so many more attacks .
nor were we prepared for their aggressive defence or attack ; it created it .
many English attacks ended in three to five seconds ; we were unable to build up protection .
however , in defence , they were able to keep their hands there , we could not combine them .
it got the team down its feet .
the ho@@ mework of the opponents was better done .
the M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ pa estimates that Estonia should have made more tac@@ tical mistakes in order to take the oppon@@ ent out in the b@@ ud .
in the last quarter , we had a zero error , but the opponents have already received several quick times .
admi@@ ra@@ bility and intense insistence , which was an al@@ ag@@ ro@@ tur@@ f &apos;s weapon , have now turned against us all .
today we did not have the strength to resist their agg@@ ressi@@ veness .
M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ p remained satisfied with his neg@@ ligence in Kal@@ ev@@ is , Mat@@ th@@ ias T@@ as@@ si .
in general , tourism can say good words about the whole team ; until now , there has been a single shock .
it is a pity that such an aggressive response had not been met before .
he has always been self @-@ confident and played out today , but he seemed to have been ti@@ red - he has carried a great deal of burden .
but he made some quite beautiful moves , which I have seen in trends in the past , &apos; added the men@@ tor .
hor@@ ren@@ d@@ ous numbers : the Cor@@ v@@ pal@@ li@@ er of the kid@@ ne@@ ys in E@@ M tur@@ f se@@ ar@@ ched less than 10 points with three quarters ...
in the U@@ 18 age classes , not only do the Cor@@ v@@ pal@@ li@@ tur@@ ni@@ ir of emi B @-@ di@@ vis@@ j@@ on , in Tallinn , where she started in Dublin the day before yesterday .
and Estonia &apos;s game with Poland , unfortunately , was bitter in the area of anti@@ qu@@ es@@ cor@@ ts .
Estonia lost 25 : 65 , but after a third quarter , the state of play was 9 : 49 , in other words , only in the last 10 minutes , opponents took their feet from the gas pe@@ at , with a delay of 16 : 16 .
in both the first and the second quarter , Estonia outlined 4 , 1 points ( 3 ) ...
in doing so , the Est@@ oni@@ ans initially caught two pieces of the first four of them in two minutes , and then two of them in 25 pieces of the game , then one in the troika and then another 21 vis@@ u@@ ally ...
perhaps , for almost half an hour , one of the 47 stands was tab@@ oo .
in addition , 2 points came from four free ton@@ es .
the losses at that time were a reasonable figure of 12 .
at the end of the game , Poland &apos;s hit hit 33 % and Estonia had 13 % ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has started to lose two , and Portugal &apos;s 83 : 56 best had to be recognised on the opening day .
NATO vessels came to Tallinn to re@@ plen@@ ish stocks
today , NATO &apos;s 1 permanent anti @-@ personnel group arrived in Tallinn for the weekend on a planned port visit to improve ship stocks and prepare for the forthcoming exercise .
during the visit , vessels are preparing for a return to the sea , while allowing crew members to take pa@@ ir@@ ant leave .
following the visit , NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters to carry out a number of exercises and to be ready for future historical explo@@ sive operations .
&quot; the participation of Lithu@@ anians in NATO and the co @-@ training they carry out in local waters is a good illustration of our integration with our alli@@ ed forces , &quot; said the Com@@ man@@ der of the Operation and Planning chain , the Com@@ man@@ der of the na@@ vy fleet .
since 29 June , NATO is leading the Latvian na@@ vy cap@@ tain G@@ vi@@ do Lau@@ du@@ ps , who took over the tasks of the Com@@ man@@ der at a ceremony in Riga from the Estonian na@@ vy officer Joh@@ an @-@ E@@ li@@ as .
the group &apos;s flagship ship is set at L@@ V@@ N@@ S Vir@@ sa@@ itis , a Latvian naval support ship which also operates at the top of the group &apos;s sta@@ r .
during this semester , the Estonian naval soldi@@ er , Mr Sakharov , will be part of the international unit .
as one of the four groups of vessels subject to NATO naval management , NATO is the 1 permanent anti @-@ personnel group , which is part of the primary rapid reaction unit , which can be sent within five days to different parts of the world by the Alliance .
4 . - O@@ ver 13 August , the ancient ru@@ ins of P@@ iri@@ ta &apos;s mon@@ as@@ tery will once again become the place where Ma@@ es@@ tro E@@ ri K@@ esti@@ val , called by Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val 13 years ago , is being held down .
this year , Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val , the artistic leader of Tallinn Film Film J@@ oo@@ sti ( 36 ) , says that it will be beautiful , powerful and unprecedented .
at the risk of J@@ oo@@ st : Cuba will find in the class of &apos; Tra@@ vi@@ eta &apos; and &apos; T@@ os@@ ca &apos; , bal@@ le@@ ti@@ la@@ responses from the s@@ no@@ ma@@ gic &apos; B@@ ole@@ ro@@ st &apos; rela@@ y &apos; Kar@@ l@@ ss@@ on@@ in &apos; , and neither will there be a lack of self @-@ sufficiency of the plan , this time by the wonderful or@@ a@@ thy of Joseph Ha@@ y@@ d@@ ni &apos;s &apos; A@@ asta@@ time &apos; , by the same international creative team that brought P@@ iri@@ la@@ ta Ha@@ y@@ d@@ ni even up a mas@@ ter@@ piece of work &apos; in 2015 .
Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val has much more than just concer@@ ts and theat@@ res .
it is greater than any mus@@ ical theat@@ re in its normal form .
it is a festi@@ val whose s@@ now is taking hold and is never going to be completely destroyed again .
because the experience the lis@@ ten@@ ers receive in this sup@@ erior and my@@ ste@@ rious environment makes human sou@@ ls more generous and touches on human models in a way that cannot be described .
at risk , you are the first year of the art leader of Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val .
did the Ma@@ es@@ tro E@@ ri K@@ ans not feel like a little big ?
of course , but since I had a very personal relationship with E@@ ri Klaus , it has helped a lot .
she went to me throughout my student career and also supported me at the beginning of a di@@ ri@@ gis@@ me career .
perhaps it is thanks to this that it will be easier for me to continue his work .
the team of Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val has been spar@@ ked up so much in prosperity in various K@@ las and , of course , it will be passed on to me as well .
it was excellent to join the team , who knows exactly how things are going .
it was the great heart of E@@ ri K@@ las@@ s that also gave me the strength to press ahead with the F@@ esti@@ val in Tallinn &apos;s film harmony .
and here I am and I can !
what could the audience do at this year &apos;s festi@@ val , what are you offering in particular ?
we have the first bal@@ let written to Mrs L@@ ind@@ gren &apos;s story , from England , Latvia , Lithuania and , by the way , as a surprise .
it is &apos; Kar@@ l@@ sson flying &apos; .
and there is a criminal nu@@ ance about the fact that the bal@@ lo@@ ver author is the Latvian com@@ po@@ ser , J@@ ur@@ is Kar@@ l@@ son , who himself expressed a wish to write it into the works .
obviously , she has had the Car@@ l@@ sson car@@ a@@ ter , who has lived with her b@@ reat@@ h since her child .
at the risk , how can you stick to all of this ?
thanks to my supporting partner , I am sure .
such a job requires a support system and a lot of love , and fortunately I have a lot of love .
and I have noticed that my personal emo@@ tions do not depend on so many other people as I am perhaps going to oppose every new day .
and this awareness of tone , of maintaining positive tone and , in fact , of s@@ mil@@ ing in the mir@@ ror in the morning , has greatly increased my happy percentage .
especially now this week , when there are the most important tests , I have been particularly keen on this and it is working .
to lau@@ gh itself is an ac@@ centu@@ ation of the brain and an increase in tone .
that is not just fine words .
I think that people do not yet know half the things about their own body that the univer@@ se offers them , but let everyone find them little by little .
now is an important moment .
do you also have some ri@@ tual before taking the di@@ ri@@ gen@@ d w@@ ed@@ ding ?
there are still clothing that has to be replaced with more convenient ones .
this is a small moment for itself .
but , overall , yes , I do not have the opportunity to pu@@ mp or make a small f@@ lash before there is a lot of time .
in fact , I even like to engage actively with people , even before the di@@ ri@@ gen@@ e is taken .
but come to Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val@@ le , what can be discovered here , too , is not a particularly large oper@@ a and bal@@ le@@ t friend !

new results of the age assessment tests for Swedish asylum seekers were published
in Sweden , asylum seekers were nominated for assessing their age @-@ old medical approach , and the latest results of the test show that more than 80 % of their constitu@@ tions were judged to be older than 18 % , but not all believe in the accuracy of the results .
the Swedish National Institute for For@@ en@@ si@@ c medicine ( R@@ un@@ ts@@ s@@ atri@@ in@@ al@@ ver@@ ket ) started with tests earlier this year .
the tests were set up to assess age more precisely during the application for asylum , after the Swedish Office for Migration ( Migration ) was criticised for failing to properly determine the age of a number of ad@@ mittedly under@@ age refugees .
to date , 68@@ 80 cases have been sent by Migration to the trial and the results of a total of 24@@ 81 tests have been published by the Institute of Justice between mid @-@ March 2017 and 31 July 2017 .
Eigh@@ ty per cent ( 2002 ) was estimated at the age of 18 or over , and in 25 other cases , the Institute of For@@ en@@ si@@ c medicine estimated that the test was &apos; perhaps 18 years old or older &apos; .
in 4@@ 32 cases , it was concluded that a person is &apos; perhaps younger than 18 &apos; .
tests will only be used if people &apos;s age is in question .
according to Joh@@ an Gö@@ Franc@@ son , who is working in the Institute of Justice , the results are consistent compared to those of the previous months .
&quot; we do not see much difference from previous months &apos; statistics ; the figures are quite consistent , &quot; said The Local newspaper .
the fact that a large number of cases were judged to be older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have li@@ ed to their age .
in May , the Institute issued the 581 test results and said that , in 4@@ 42 cases , &apos; there are indications that the person under investigation is 18 or more . &apos;
however , when the results of these 581 tests were examined by Mrs Svensson Dag@@ bla@@ ed , it turned out that in 2@@ 43 cases the person had directly claimed that she would receive 18 this year .
this medical age assessment method , by carrying out smart X @-@ ray pic@@ tures and by field classes MR@@ T , has been criticised in some quarters , after which they are allowed to be analysed by den@@ tists and radi@@ olo@@ gis@@ ts .
one of the sceptics is Claude Mar@@ cus , the Institute of K@@ aro@@ lin@@ ska &apos;s endo@@ ch@@ rin@@ olo@@ gist , whose tasks include assessing people &apos;s biodiversity maturity in order to determine whether they went through the public &apos;s normal audience sooner or later .
&quot; I have had reason to think about this and I do not think that the measurement we are currently using should be used .
setting biological age in this way is very uncertain .
if we cannot say clearly , then we should not pretend to get , &apos; he said to Forest ro in his newspaper .
but Joh@@ an Gö@@ Franc@@ son from the Institute of For@@ en@@ si@@ c medicine defended the accuracy of the tests : &apos; generally speaking , there is little risk of a child being left in@@ accurate .
the highest risk , at around 10 % , is in the event of a person being slightly under 18 . &quot;

Mrs Maria O@@ rel , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old master , gave the London M@@ il a nice po@@ t of debate by getting a good 18 with 6@@ 7.@@ 3@@ 7@@ p@@ m .
he then stated that M@@ M &apos;s no@@ ori@@ um was a female dis@@ po@@ sa@@ ble , and a jo@@ y@@ ful woman confirmed that she hopes to fight for med@@ als in the future .
the competition was successful and I had good experience .
I immediately took away my average result with the first test ( 6@@ 4.@@ 80 ) , the second ( 6@@ 2.@@ 80 ) risk too much , and the third ( 6@@ 7.@@ 37 ) was able to keep it clear &quot; said O@@ rel after the competition .
I was looking for my emissions and I am very pleased that I found them .
Mrs O@@ re@@ li M@@ M &apos;s debate ended with a good 18 places .
Vi@@ h@@ mas@@ ad@@ u O@@ reli@@ t was not confused because he is on strike through the LTTE sta@@ di@@ um .
&apos;@@ I am afraid &apos; , he said a little mu@@ te .
the London Olympic sta@@ di@@ um had almost a full house of the people , did O@@ rel regain people around it or were they able to turn off ?
I have Mr Tajani , but in a positive sense .
everyone says it adds - that is how it is !
if you compete on your own , you can experience it .
he then confirmed that he was satisfied with the debate on M@@ M and that he had many other good competitions : &apos; I came here with the 3@@ 2nd , the last result , I ended in 18@@ th place .
this is a very good result .
I am 20 years old and I am a man - that is the only thing that matters .
I take away a good experience and , in some days , I want to compete on behalf of med@@ als .
Western Vir@@ g@@ ina Governor announced party change
the Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a Democrat govern@@ or , Jim Justice , announced at Thursday evening &apos;s meeting with President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ ire that he would change political parties .
&quot; be that or not , the democrats wal@@ ked away from me , &quot; said Governor Justice .
&quot; today , I say to you , having said a lot of pra@@ ises and thinking ... today , I am telling you , the Western pe@@ as@@ ants , that I can no longer help you as a democratic govern@@ or . &quot;
there were re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ations at the gathering .
&quot; so I will be Re@@ publi@@ can tomorrow , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a engine@@ er , I would say to you that it is time to play a different game . &quot;
a T@@ ru@@ mp had previously promised a major announcement at the meeting of Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
T@@ ru@@ mp won the West Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ as with 42 points , and Justice did not support the Democrat candidate , H@@ ill@@ ary Clin@@ ton .
justice , which is the only bil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e in the state , according to For@@ bes@@ i , was elected in 2016 .
in For@@ be , it is owned by coal mines in five states and by the coal business in its own right .
it is worth around USD 1.@@ 59 billion .
at the same time , the Re@@ publi@@ can National Committee ( R@@ N@@ C ) issued an announcement on Thursday evening that &apos; the party change of Governor Justice is another blow to the democratic party that would prevent the country from improving again rather than working towards it &apos; .
&quot; only 15 Governor Justice &apos;s announcement of the lowest number of states and control over his history is simply the most recent wake @-@ up call to a party that is from the bottom to the bottom and cannot find a positive and united message , &quot; said R@@ N@@ C Cha@@ ir@@ woman R@@ on@@ na Mc@@ Mc@@ Daniel &apos;s statement to C@@ S New@@ si .
it is no surprise that , where there are many people , there are also many injured .
Ur@@ met , in her medical tent on the web , told the A@@ ca@@ de@@ my that they had to allocate quite a lot of pos@@ ters yesterday .
fruit and mar@@ ches are the main ones , the wrong s@@ takes and the light falls .
of course , head@@ lines , s@@ qua@@ res and sho@@ es as well .
according to Ur@@ me@@ ti , visitors come to the festi@@ val with false foot@@ wear , and that is how the problems come .
the media have also had to help visitors with a few major injuries - there have been some panic and there has also been a foot@@ bal@@ ls .
we have also raised concerns when a person has turned his hand or his finger down .
we are doing more here , sending bigger nur@@ ses to hospital .

Co@@ e congratulated the Russians on their honest apolo@@ gy for the D@@ oping scandal
S@@ ebas@@ tian Co@@ e , the international r@@ hin@@ t of the L@@ igh@@ ge@@ an , said that he had &apos; Russia &apos;s four @-@ day honest apolo@@ gy &apos; for the D@@ oping scandal , repeated that now is not the time to allow the country to rec@@ lai@@ m sport .
at the eve of the ligh@@ t@@ weight World C@@ up , the Russian light Force , D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lit@@ h@@ tin , said at the Congress of IA@@ AF , that the ban on competition imposed on his country was right and has a clear objective to combat doping .
he apolog@@ ised &apos; to all the ath@@ le@@ tes who had been s@@ pared the gol@@ den and sil@@ ver med@@ als during the competition &apos; .
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted to maintain the ban on state @-@ spon@@ sored doping in Russia in November 2015 , following the W@@ AD@@ A report .
&quot; I think that today was a very honest response , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to journalists .
&quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian League itself acknowledged that they have had quite challenging times and that they would do everything they could to restructure the Union . &quot;
in addition , Co@@ e said that he was delighted that Russia accepted the criteria for its own return .
&quot; I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is being made , but Congress supports the group &apos;s proposal that this is not the right time to withdraw Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we must do everything we can in the next few months to norm@@ alise the situation .
we have always been guided by the principle that we want to separate clean ath@@ le@@ tes from a system that has been broken , &quot; he added .
Eigh@@ teen Russian ath@@ le@@ tes who meet the strict criteria for IA@@ AF will compete as neutral ath@@ le@@ tes at the World C@@ up in London starting on Friday .
the chair of the IA@@ AF Group , R@@ une Andersson , said on Monday that Russia does not yet meet a number of sustainability criteria .
following a presentation by the IA@@ AF Council , he told the press in London that doping control was still inadequate and that the banned train@@ ers were still operating freely .
the electric car revolution is dramatically changing the demand for metals .
who are the winners and losers ?
not only does the electric car revolution change everything from the fuel market to the infrastructure , it will also create new winners and losers on the me@@ tal market .
although mining gi@@ ants like G@@ len@@ core can say that they will win from one place and lose out on the other , it will not help the smaller mining firms .
at present , G@@ len@@ core coal and oil are serving , but future demand for co@@ ca@@ ts , li@@ thi@@ um , cop@@ per , alu@@ mini@@ um and nic@@ kel is growing in the age of electric cars .
this year , governments in the UK , France and Norway have made contributions to the spread of electric cars , allowing the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be banned in the coming decades .
so Vol@@ vo has already been aware that they are planning to abandon the internal combustion engine , and T@@ es@@ la is bringing cheaper sta@@ ple 3 electric cars onto the market .
B@@ om@@ berg New Energy Finance forecasts that over two decades now electric cars will be sold more than oil @-@ fired cars .
&quot; for some metals this will change everything , &quot; said the Capital Economics raw materials analy@@ st Sim@@ ona G@@ amb@@ ran@@ ini B@@ is@@ berg .
we have already seen a major impact on metals such as co@@ ca@@ ine and li@@ thi@@ um , the demand for which has been growing for years .
electric cars have about three times more answers than the conventional car , according to G@@ len@@ core .
more answers are needed at re@@ charging stations , so Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris estimates that it will increase cop@@ per demand by around 5 % by 2025 .
an increase in demand for electric vehicle bat@@ teries means an additional demand for li@@ thi@@ um , co@@ bal@@ t , gra@@ p@@ hi@@ t and man@@ gan@@ ese .
the G@@ len@@ core will generate revenues from the growing trend for electric cars from the cop@@ per price rises and from the fact that it is the world &apos;s largest producer of co@@ sco@@ pes , the forecast for J@@ eff@@ coordinate Group .
this bro@@ ker company estimates that F@@ Friday report @-@ Mc@@ Mo@@ R@@ an and First Qu@@ an@@ ma Min@@ er@@ als will be the winners of the electric car race .
the market is reacting to a changing trend .
this year , 70 % of the London me@@ tal code has been bur@@ nt .
the rise in soil prices was 37 % .
the left has also been spending 14 % this year , mainly because of economic growth .
G@@ len@@ core excise duty increased by 20 % in London after exceeding the price level to ri@@ val Rio T@@ into Group , B@@ H@@ P Bil@@ lit@@ on and Ang@@ lo telecom .
on the side of the losers , lead companies such as Rec@@ y@@ cle@@ x and Cam@@ p@@ ine have to adapt to the new era .
the main end @-@ use use of the gas is the bat@@ teries supplying the star@@ ch star@@ ters with the petrol and diesel engine .
electric cars use li@@ thi@@ um bat@@ teries .
&quot; this is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found for other purposes to overcome the fall in demand , &quot; Michael W@@ id@@ mer , President of the American Mer@@ ri@@ ll Lyn@@ ch me@@ tal market , said .
the effect of the open @-@ flow trend has not yet been noticed in the form of price movements .
P@@ li@@ i has risen by 17 % this year , and this is the best me@@ tal in London , among the main industrial metals .
investors will see problems for the me@@ tal only in the long term .
&quot; I am not sure that lead will be so bad because cheap oil keeps ordinary cars competitive , &quot; said Her@@ wi@@ g Schmidt , the ven@@ ture@@ r of Tri@@ land Me@@ tal@@ s .
if lead demand falls , it will be slow .
this may be the case in about ten years &apos; time .
in the meantime , however , stricter emission standards mean an increase in demand for hybrid hybrid cars , which are dependent on the frequent introduction of engines from advanced lead @-@ based bat@@ teries , will be assessed by the international lead and z@@ oning research organisation .
Ker@@ g@@ metals such as alu@@ mini@@ um replace steel , as a ligh@@ ter car can drive further away with less electricity .
this can already explain an additional minimum demand of 1.6 million tonnes up to 2013 @-@ 2016 .
this represents 2.7 % of the world &apos;s production of alu@@ mini@@ um .
this trend is likely to increase , Mr W@@ id@@ mer said .
A@@ lu@@ mini@@ um has risen by 13 % this year , as growing demand from car manufacturers has led to a market deficit .
steel producers will not .
ak S@@ way holding works with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce wonderful car chains .
Ar@@ cel@@ or@@ Mit@@ tal and Ta@@ ta Europe are also trying to develop a ligh@@ ter mel@@ t@@ down from steel in order to counter the lower minimum .
&apos;@@ A strong steel should be the answer to this development &apos; , said Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris analysis by Syl@@ vain Br@@ un@@ et .
there is some progress in Europe .
the end of the oil era can also bring suffering to the pla@@ te .
the soil took around half of this precious diesel engine as cataly@@ sts for cars , announced by the me@@ tal re@@ fin@@ er Joh@@ n@@ son Mat@@ they .
&quot; many raw materials with a high demand today , such as oil and pos@@ ter , may not face a high demand in the future , &quot; said Bernard D@@ ah@@ da@@ h , the Na@@ ti@@ x raw materials analy@@ st .
this does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important , but their importance will change over 15 years .
the plan manufacturers believe in continued demand for diesel hybrid cars .
Marc G@@ ry@@ n@@ berg , leader of Un@@ core , said that in 2025 more hybrid cars will continue to be sold as hybrid cars .
in the 10 @-@ year perspective , the great hope among the planned producers is of the hydrogen @-@ based cars developed by To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Motors and Hy@@ ire Mo@@ tos , which depend on the pla@@ tin@@ um to produce power from hydrogen .
so far , however , this technology has not yet commercial justified itself .
&quot; dialogue seems to be a clear losers on the road to electric cars , &quot; said Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P from Paris to Br@@ un@@ et .
German car manufacturers suffered a major set@@ back in July , as the court in S@@ tut@@ t@@ g@@ art banned diesel in the home town of Mercedes @-@ Ben@@ z and Por@@ sch@@ e .
how do the financial rules for football affect Ney@@ mar@@ i &apos;s transition to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing the un@@ bri@@ dled spending of European football clubs do not prevent the record transfer of the Ney@@ ra World Ex@@ po from Spain to the French club Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main from going to Barcelona .
any consequences for UEFA , the governing body that domin@@ ates the European game and is in a position to prevent teams from participating in the pres@@ ti@@ gious League of Ministers &apos; tur@@ f , await the Paris Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ Ma@@ in .
the financial rules for fair play introduced by UEFA in 2011 ( F@@ F@@ F@@ P ) mean that PS@@ G will have to demonstrate at some point that the Ney@@ mar transition was financed without huge losses .
Barcelona was paid EUR 2@@ 22 million ( USD 2@@ 62 million ) for the sole purpose of buying out its treaty and Ney@@ mar@@ i &apos;s salary will reach tens of millions of dollars per year .
there are some financial aspects of Ney@@ mar &apos;s transfer to the French club .
PS@@ G will no doubt be able to come up with such money to recruit Ney@@ ra and put its sta@@ rs on the map , given that the team will be funded by the family governing the Ka@@ tar Energy bill .
clubs are allowed to spend a great deal of money in recru@@ iting players , but they have to balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to get out of football .
the F@@ F@@ F@@ P was set up by Michel Pla@@ tini after his election as President of UEFA in 2007 .
this former French player believed that clubs in search of success are actually engaging in fraud and ris@@ king ruin if banks or owners were to give up subsidies .
from 2011 , rather than debt for F@@ F@@ P clubs , the focus will be on monitoring these losses .
this change means that the business model used by Ro@@ man Ab@@ ra@@ mo@@ vi@@ ch first in 2003 in C@@ hel@@ sea - to buy a club with potential and then to spend a great deal in order to improve the team and create a global brand - is more difficult to implement .
during the current three @-@ year evaluation period for the F@@ F@@ F@@ P , which runs until 2018 , clubs can bear losses of up to EUR 30 million .
and even though Pla@@ tini was shame@@ lessly excluded from the presidential office in 2015 , his successor , Alexander C@@ ef@@ er@@ in , remains committed to preventing excessive spending .
&quot; F@@ F@@ P is certainly not dead and we will no doubt continue to strengthen these rules , &quot; said The associated P@@ rin@@ le Andre@@ a Tra@@ ver@@ so last week , UEFA @-@ s F@@ F@@ F@@ P &apos;s watch@@ dog .
although PS@@ G pay for the Ney@@ mar over @-@ purchase clause as a single full pay@@ out , they will be able to distribute this amount for accounting purposes throughout the period of validity of the agreement .
Ney@@ mar concluded a five @-@ year agreement , which makes it possible to demonstrate a transitional fee of EUR 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million over the next five years .
on the occasion of the first wave of sanctions for the F@@ F@@ F@@ P in 2014 , PS@@ G , together with Manch@@ ester C@@ it@@ y@@ i , a member of Abu D@@ ha@@ bi , suffered the most severe penalties .
a fine of EUR 60 million ( currently EUR 82 million ) was imposed on the PS@@ G , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million , and a club was called on to limit the League of Me@@ is@@ ters &apos; team to 21 players in the 2014 @-@ 2015 season instead of normal 25 .
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to cross @-@ select financial regulators by inf@@ lating their incomes through companies associated with the owners of the club .
although a company of Q@@ a@@ tar may spon@@ sor PS@@ G , if the value of spon@@ sorship were considered to be above standard market rates , UEFA would not allow it to be taken into account as an official income .
this was the case in 2014 when UEFA decided that Q@@ a@@ tar Tourism Authority ( PS@@ G ) value was inf@@ lated .
it has been said that certain parts of the Ney@@ mar@@ i PS@@ G service may come from contributions to Q@@ a@@ tar by the 20 @-@ 22 World C@@ up Management Committee .
however , PS@@ G and Q@@ a@@ tar 20@@ 22 deny that Ney@@ ra could become a member of the World C@@ up and claim that UEFA &apos;s regulatory authorities can easily un@@ cover such a manoeuvre .
the penalties previously imposed on the PS@@ G mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant in any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
people who were familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed the transition pro@@ actively with PS@@ G Ney@@ mar@@ i .
they talked to The associated Congress , provided that their anon@@ y@@ mity is guaranteed , as they are not allowed to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest reports show that the PS@@ G will make profits of more than € 10 million over the 2015 @-@ 2016 season at around € 54@@ 2.4 million .
data from the last financial year have not yet been published .
PS@@ G hopes that the arrival of Ney@@ ra will have a positive impact on spon@@ sorship transactions , commerci@@ alisation and brand sales .
the club is looking forward to an increase of at least 30 % in relation to the conclusion of the contract .
Spain too , clearly anno@@ yed by the departure of one of the largest football sta@@ rs , tried to prevent the Ney@@ mar@@ i transition by claiming that the PS@@ G was in breach of F@@ F@@ P .
this is a clear case of &apos; financial doping &apos; with the club and state , &apos; said to the Spanish newspaper , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , with President La T@@ eb@@ as , indicating that PS@@ G is mainly owned by Q@@ a@@ tar .
Ar@@ sen@@ al mountain j@@ ung@@ er Ar@@ conne@@ W@@ en@@ ger , who belongs to an American sporting mag@@ net , shares with La li the attitude of state funding for the club .
&quot; this is a consequence of property rights and has changed the entire football landscape completely over the past 15 years , &quot; said W@@ en@@ ger on Thursday .
&quot; when a club belongs to a state , everything is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play , as the country can have other ways or other interests to make such a big player represent the country . &quot;

today 50 years ago : an un@@ ri@@ val@@ led storm in Estonia , which ri@@ pped off houses with ro@@ of@@ s and win@@ dows .
the storm @-@ ren@@ a@@ med hur@@ ric@@ ane that ra@@ ged on 6 and 7 August caused serious damage , particularly to the Baltic States , Har@@ t@@ land and Rap@@ la@@ mas .
in north @-@ west Estonia , during these days , the wind was over 30 m / s .
my old me@@ tal ran from one card t@@ ree to another and covered with orders to support them .
all was blind and de@@ pressing , like a world lesson .
the mother has already flying from the house ro@@ of@@ s , in 2002 the old Mrs L@@ inda K@@ uro@@ va Ha@@ ap@@ cus re@@ minis@@ cent of a magaz@@ ine in an interview with the Estonian natural world .
the hus@@ band of L@@ inda saw the t@@ reas@@ ure he plan@@ ted collapsed .
but what sort of rub@@ b@@ ish do you have your hands on , where are you going against such a storm ?
the sea came under the window , from win@@ dows pri@@ ced in water &apos; , Mrs L@@ inda ton@@ a , who was on the streets of Ha@@ ap@@ sal@@ us Kal@@ da , spoke .
the fact that the roads were full of trees and the ro@@ of of the railway station had flo@@ wn 20 @-@ 30 metres away saw L@@ inda most of the w@@ ed@@ dings as they did just next morning .
according to local authorities , behind Par@@ ale@@ pa , trees were lying behind the fo@@ am , some are absolutely long , some are boys .
everyone saw a very de@@ pressing storm , a storm ra@@ ging through hundreds of old trees and pragmatism like war .
Western Vir@@ u@@ lands were not particularly hard hit by August 1967 compared to Western Estonia , but the losses were also huge there , the Official Journal of Vir@@ u@@ ony in 2007 .
the Ha@@ ap@@ sal@@ u L@@ fossil park and the P@@ ad@@ ise Par@@ k were swe@@ pt from the ground , but our mon@@ ks were also severely affected .
in Tallinn , the wind was measured at a speed of up to 35 metres per second , that is to say , approximately 130 km per hour .
in Tallinn , M@@ eri@@ el , on the evening of 6.@@ August , one of the te@@ ars of lead had sh@@ ou@@ ted : &apos; mother , mother !
the chic@@ k@@ ens are in the air and can no longer be signed ! &apos; , the Official Journal of Vir@@ u@@ Country has written .
the generation &apos;s term building in Vil@@ j@@ an@@ ore was destroyed so much by the storm that it was decided to be disman@@ tled at a later date .
the design of T@@ ü@@ r &apos;s ski moun@@ tains did not stand up to the August storm , which was later not restored .
on 12 August 1967 , the newspaper Red T@@ ae@@ t wrote that the urb@@ anisation of towns and settlements from land@@ locked trees and their ox@@ y@@ gen is progressing slowly , and that the population could be involved in cleaning work .
fruit fields were also severely affected by the storm , and the newspaper stated that &apos; party @-@ to @-@ party organisations must be an incentive and direction for both cleaning and fer@@ tile harves@@ ts &apos; .
they can be discussed in cases where average wind speed exceeds 3@@ 2.7 m / s .
the net wind record in Estonia will remain in place from 2 November 19@@ 69 , when Ru@@ h@@ ent measured the wind as a matter of urgency at 48 m / s .
the V@@ only story on the island broke the s@@ word , so the high speed of the wind measured there could not be accurately recorded .
secret of old bathing areas : night @-@ to @-@ night cleaning and poor coastal weather
cold summer bel@@ ls also mean less duplication in the ski areas of Tallinn .
&apos;@@ I@@ f it is not , people are on the be@@ ach and , if not , there are no people &apos; , it is the cor@@ der who says the floor .

in fact , the latter sa@@ ves seven c@@ enti@@ metres deep through the sand , clearing off marine lit@@ ter and the risk left out of it by people : bot@@ tles , cigarette factories and so on .
people still come to ran@@ k , regardless of whether the water is warm or not .
if it is beautiful , people are on the be@@ ach and , if not , there are no people , &apos; the management of the company Ha@@ ab@@ er says Alexander r U@@ so@@ v , head of the maintenance work on the floor .
at 6.@@ 30 p.m. , there is bitter cleaning on the be@@ ach , because at 8 p.m. the pos@@ ter must be in order for the people .
the job is already on track at four o &apos;@@ clock .
apart from S@@ tro@@ om , he is still keeping an eye on P@@ iri@@ ta , La@@ ke Har@@ vel , Ka@@ ku@@ p and Pal@@ eri@@ a@@ are P@@ ik@@ ak@@ ari .
landfills have been reduced .
years ago , it was much more .
people now know how to assess what is being done for them &apos; , U@@ so@@ v , who has pic@@ ked the sho@@ es for 15 years , speaks .
it was previously the case that , when something new was put on the table , it was broken next day .
now what the be@@ ach is kept on .
price of clean be@@ ach
one of the biggest jobs on Estonian shores is the clearing of marine rub@@ b@@ ish , known as ad@@ ru , on the shore .
for example , on the surface of P@@ iri@@ ta , it must be transported to 400 000 tonnes during the coastal season .
&apos;@@ This is an un@@ beli@@ evable amount , &apos; notes U@@ so@@ v .
the second large category is municipal rub@@ b@@ ish , or everything that people leave behind themselves .
at a one and a half kilometres on the S@@ tro@@ om coast , there are eight large waste @-@ se@@ ine units which need to be emp@@ tied three times a week .
that is how much rub@@ b@@ ish is generated .
however , the cold summer weather has meant that the waste is one fifth less than otherwise .
the third species is de@@ ser@@ ted objects .
these are mostly cargo journeys .
this time , U@@ so@@ v has pul@@ led out of the sand inside ten metres of the slu@@ dge .
they will wait for the owners to be@@ set the timber route .
&apos;@@ normally more people come out of them , but that is a normal harvest &apos; , which already knows that it will soon find them back in the sand .
children come to be@@ ach and take toys to plant them in the sand again .
Prüm is being tor@@ n up
Erika Sch@@ ol@@ ler , the representative of the administrative services , ad@@ mits that the tra@@ ctor &apos;s screening work is disrup@@ ting local communities .
noise , which runs from night to night , inter@@ fe@@ res with the ad@@ jac@@ ent population .
however , that work is impossible on a day @-@ to @-@ day basis .
in one month , you get a war twice over .
&apos;@@ I@@ f we do not , we will be fined by the city section &apos; , Sch@@ ol@@ ler will note .
however , like P@@ iri@@ ta , P@@ ik@@ ka@@ r and Per@@ sian , the aim is to get S@@ tro@@ om rand down to the international Se@@ al quality mark .
&quot; there is much more work in Estonia to ensure that be@@ aches are maintained than in Europe , &quot; says Sch@@ ol@@ ler .
we have more ad@@ ole@@ sc@@ ence and stone and it is more difficult to drive in the sand .
what we have on our be@@ aches is less rub@@ b@@ ish than elsewhere in Europe .
when you hear that a be@@ ach talks about rub@@ b@@ ish , Martin is moving around un@@ compul@@ sor@@ ily near S@@ tro@@ om be@@ ach &apos;s inter@@ views , highlighting the current weaknesses on the floor .
Hom@@ o is a picture everywhere in the gallery .
the problem is birds and net sla@@ ves , who have pul@@ led rub@@ b@@ ish bags in the first place , &quot; Martin decla@@ res .
although it is difficult to assume that people can change their behaviour to date , Martin hopes that the urban government will do something about the waste b@@ in chains and impose on them , for example , the camer@@ as , in order to prevent them , at least on the birds , from finding themselves in the news there .
in general , however , Martin &apos;s be@@ ach is satisfied with the development .
we can see that the city is taking care of this .
it has become more pleasant with children &apos;s s@@ qua@@ res , enligh@@ tened and fresh as@@ ph@@ oned roads .
it used to be the case that you could only travel one way on a case @-@ by @-@ case basis , &quot; says Martin .

Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain at their level , as weak growth and the easing of inflation have sof@@ tened speculation about the increase .
Bank of England has warned that growth will remain slu@@ gg@@ ish because households &apos; hard @-@ pressed incomes have put interest rates on hold .
policy makers in the Bank &apos;s Monetary Policy Committee ( MP@@ C ) voted for a 6 : 2 % retention and fewer members will be demanding an increase this month , as slow economic growth has weakened support for the rise .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank cut its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on household incomes would persist , as inflation is still expected to rise close to 3 % in the autumn .
at the same time , the Bank also sign@@ alled that the increase in rates will be necessary to contain inflation over the next few years due to Bre@@ x , and the financial markets may require an expected increase in credit costs .
the Members also voted a year ago in favour of a partial withdrawal of the ma@@ m@@ mot@@ h package , which was introduced as a result of Bre@@ x .
in February , the Bank will termin@@ ate the fixed @-@ term financing scheme , which provides cheap funding to the banks , even though it said that it is now expected to make an increase of GBP 15 billion under this scheme , which is GBP 115 billion .
in the minutes of the decision on the rate , the Bank says : &apos; gross domestic product ( GDP ) will remain power@@ less in the near future as the difficult situation of real household incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption &apos; .
as regards rates , it was reiterated that , in order to mitigate inflation , &apos; fiscal policy making a little effort &apos; was needed , to a &apos; somewhat higher degree &apos; than was expected on the markets .
Mr Böge is now forecas@@ ting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second one in 2020 .
however , the Bank stressed that any hy@@ pe is gradual and limited .
the Bank &apos;s reduced growth projections for this year and next year are comparable to 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
the forecast of 1.8 % growth in 2018 remained unchanged .
after that news , the p@@ ound went down against the dollar and the euro .
Na@@ el fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 dollars and 0.@@ 4 % to 1.@@ 11 euro .
the decision not to make any changes is due to recent disappointing growth figures , which have da@@ m@@ pen@@ ed the growing hopes of a rise in intellectual GDP in the second quarter , at 0.2 % in the previous three months , to 0.@@ 3 % .
the Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.@@ 3 % in the third quarter , although it will pick up slightly by the end of the year .
the Bank &apos;s latest inflation report gave little reason to re@@ jo@@ ice with rising inflation and mis@@ er@@ able households suffering from wage increases by saying that the situation will get even worse before improving .
it was added that the monetary policy cannot prevent an income blow in the next few years , but a marked recovery in wages is expected towards the end of a three @-@ year forecast .
due to the na@@ il p@@ ound , the economy is also stimu@@ lated by the growing demand for British produce , which is partly re@@ warding lower costs for consumers .
the decision comes one year after the rates were taken last August at 0.@@ 25 % after the shocking EU referendum , which caused the p@@ ound to collapse .
the Bank estimates that it is likely to take four years to brea@@ the full life into prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final decision , the growing demand for raising the rate was felt , as inflation had increased the pressure on hard @-@ pressed households ; in July , three policy makers called for an increase of 0.5 % .
inflation fell by 2.6 % last month , compared to 2.9 % in June , although the bank said it was expected to rise again in the coming months .
the Bank said that excessive growth compared to the 2 % target was entirely due to the weak p@@ ound .
the head of Co@@ rec@@ o mortgage bro@@ kers , Andrew Mon@@ t@@ la@@ ke , said : &apos; in the light of the recent downturn in exchange rates , it seems that the mortgage market will become increasingly competitive again , as creditors will want to work and look forward to concluding the year positively .
Eurosta@@ rs seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are coming to an end , since re@@ financing , often without ear@@ ning and at low rates , has become increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS written 10 000 HIV drugs for controversial people
since September , patients have had access to &apos; trans@@ forma@@ tive &apos; HIV @-@ preventive treatment after a battle w@@ aged in a Supreme Court over whether the N@@ HS should finance the medicine .
N@@ HS England has announced that public health care is now estimated to make available to 10 000 people in the initial three @-@ year clinical trial before the exposure to pro@@ phy@@ la@@ ctic ( Pr@@ EP ) - a ta@@ ble@@ t that is man@@ ned before mid @-@ term and which has shown a reduction in the risk of infection for high @-@ risk people by around 86 % .
the N@@ HS agreed to fund a clinical attempt after the Court of appeal supported last year &apos;s Supreme Court ruling that the N@@ HS would be able to pay for Pr@@ EP , despite the institution &apos;s own claims that the medicine should be financed by local authorities .
Simon Ste@@ crates , CE@@ O of the N@@ HS Eng@@ land , welcomed the launch unve@@ iled on Thursday as &apos; new far @-@ reaching intervention &apos; , while the National AIDS Fund ( NA@@ T ) described it as a &apos; land@@ mark moment &apos; .
sexual health clin@@ ics in London , B@@ right ton , Manch@@ ester , Li@@ ver@@ po@@ l and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d are among the first to register people , and in October there will be more clin@@ ics before the programme is put in place everywhere in England by April 2018 .
C@@ inde@@ rella pro@@ phy@@ la@@ ctic ( Pr@@ EP ) is a display of HIV drugs before the rec@@ ess to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
clinical trials show that the Pr@@ EP significantly reduces transmission of HIV to people at risk of infection .
the introduction of the Pr@@ EP before the rec@@ ess means that there are enough medicines in the body of the human being that prevent HIV from being infected .
such medicines can be taken every day , or at the latest two hours before the rec@@ ess .
among the successful candidates are les@@ bian or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ gender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and cannot be treated .
clin@@ ics are identified by suitable people willing to participate in clinical trial , including men , women , trans@@ gender people and those whose HIV @-@ related partner cannot receive anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment .
people who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there can also register their wish to participate in the local sexual health clin@@ ics participating in the programme .
the programme costs GBP 10 million and N@@ HS England signed an agreement to obtain medicines this week following an international procurement procedure .
the purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the real potential of Pr@@ EP by gathering clinical evidence of who the medicine is intended for and how it is consumed and implemented in a large picture .
Ste@@ crates said : &apos; this new massive intervention should complement and intensify the wide @-@ ranging and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV .
this is another milestone in more than three decades of fighting one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity . &quot;
D@@ eb@@ or@@ ah gold , CE@@ O of NA@@ T , said , &apos; This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV .
the Pr@@ EP , if it is properly targeted at those who need it and are at risk , will offer an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England .
since September , people with high risk of HIV in England , through this clinical trial funded by the N@@ HS , have had access to a powerful new tool that is individually managed and does not depend on negotiations with the partner , thereby improving many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
ian Green , the CE@@ O of the Ter@@ rence Higgins Fund , said : &apos; now it is a priority to ensure that the clinical trial is carried out quickly across the country and that no member of the HIV risk group is left behind .
now that the Pr@@ EP clinical trial has been obtained , we are on the way to protecting more than 10 000 people who are at risk of being infected with HIV .
the Minister for Public Health , Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , said : &apos; the start of the Pr@@ EP clinical trial is very welcome and long overdue following months of delay and government te@@ aring its feet .
evidence shows how much change this medicine can make to HIV prevention and to stop the spread of this life @-@ changing infection .
this clinical test takes us one step closer to a full understanding of the Pr@@ EP &apos;s advantages .
now it is important that the clinical trial is taken over as soon as possible to protect people who have contact with HIV and to bring us one step closer to halting the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
electricity prices have risen by 12 % in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
in July , the difference in electricity stock exchange between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania next day decreased to EUR 1.@@ 94 , compared to EUR 7.@@ 71 in June this year , announced Ele@@ ring .
the main cause of the price difference is the rich@@ ness of the Lithuanian @-@ Swedish Community .
in Estonia , the average price for electricity exchanges last month was EUR 34.@@ 33 per hour , and the price rose by 12 % compared to June .
in Latvia and Lithuania , the price fell by 5 % to EUR 3@@ 6.@@ 27 per me@@ ga@@ phone hour .
in Finland , the price was EUR 34.@@ 17 and the system price of the electricity stock exchange north was EUR 2@@ 6.@@ 37 per me@@ ga@@ phone hour .
prices rose by 12 and 7 % respectively .
between Estonia and Finland , electricity moved 75 % of last month &apos;s hours towards Estonia and 16 % of hours from Estonia to Finland .
the remaining nine % of hours between the two countries did not carry out the next day &apos;s transactions .
Estonia and Latvia moved 99 % of the time from Estonia to Latvia and 73 % of the hours used the full transmission capacity .
on the Nas@@ da@@ q OM@@ X market , which took place on the last trading day in July , the price of the electricity stock exchange can be around EUR 34 and EUR 37 per hour in September .
carbon prices affecting the electricity production price increased last month and transactions took place at a price of between EUR 5.@@ 04 and EUR 5.@@ 47 per tonne .
high life - half @-@ dec@@ re@@ es and smart de@@ sig@@ ners have made it home to a small Ear@@ ls Court room
Jo@@ anne Le@@ igh , a former ban@@ ker who is a passion@@ ate property innova@@ tor , changed his great home of K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to the Ear@@ ls Court flat in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of Qu@@ e@@ en Anne Ter@@ interoperability , and the fact that Jo@@ anne has not pac@@ ked her bags and sold it over is a tribute to the new design .
&quot; before that , I lived on much larger soil with my former life partner in K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; said Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I looked for something that would be the equivalent of the price I offered .
I was told that Ear@@ ls Court flat and had the same high wa@@ re@@ houses .
I lo@@ ved it and made an offer the same day . &quot;
since its first visit , this 93 @-@ square me@@ tre flat has gone through a complete innova@@ tor .
at the beginning , it was a s@@ lee@@ ping room and a complicated flat : in order to get a s@@ le@@ ep , you had to walk through a kit@@ chen , and Jo@@ anne wanted to include savings and half order in order to exploit high @-@ quality disco@@ veries .
&quot; I wanted high @-@ profile , big win@@ dows , a lot of light .
these were my demands , &apos; he said .
he asked Er@@ fan Az@@ adi N@@ ot@@ ting from the archite@@ ctural and de@@ sig@@ ner radio Du@@ ck &amp; D to take advantage of the 3.@@ 8 m de@@ ser@@ t and create a home , which would be not just a development object , but a place where Jo@@ anne could live .
it was not high enough to add two areas to each other , so the archite@@ ctural challenge was to create half @-@ order where you could stand .
Mr fan had to take a creative approach .
&quot; construction is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to restructure the rooms so that they were on each other without having to bo@@ w down .
it was not just about building a platform , but about using steel construction to make it right for the upper and lower margins to be built . &quot;
this posi@@ tioning made it possible for Mr Er@@ fan@@ o to create two be@@ ans in the room with full he@@ ight with a lot of dramatic elements .
the pen@@ al age is opening up with the new light from the R@@ et@@ rou@@ vi@@ us window to gla@@ mo@@ rous housing under the gu@@ ise .
a gol@@ den fur@@ ni@@ ture , sil@@ ver details and retro@@ spe@@ ctive Ser@@ ge M@@ ou@@ ille &apos;s light highlight space style .
the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in the inclusion of theat@@ re , space and lighting .
mir@@ rors have been added to both sides of the short corridor to appear longer .
in the night I am giving the impression of a second window with mir@@ ror .
during their introduction , a mir@@ ror retention site will be available to all gar@@ ments and glass requirements of Jo@@ anne .
the possibility of closing down vegetables if it is not used adds to housing , creating a more gla@@ mo@@ rous space .
Ac@@ cor@@ ding kit@@ chen cu@@ res are nothing new .
however , what is unique in this kit@@ chen is the fact that it is a sort of u@@ prising in the gar@@ age .
&apos;@@ It took a bit of design work in this regard &apos; explains the case of the M@@ D@@ F , which has been spo@@ iled with a steel strengthening .
&apos;@@ This has a counter@@ weight and therefore uni@@ tes very simply to reject it &apos; .
thanks to the smart use of space and savings buildings , Jo@@ anne now has 16 extra metres , an additional be@@ dro@@ om and a better fla@@ x plan .
&quot; after all , flo@@ oring is what you sell - or what gives value to property - &apos; says Er@@ fan &apos; .
&apos;@@ The anch@@ or &apos;s ro@@ ck takes an outdated as@@ hes and makes calculations based on the underground area &apos; .
here they have been able to increase the floor floor , using high @-@ quality materials to add luxury to space .
&quot; materials are what you are dealing with and thus help to bring about an emotional link with your homes , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&apos;@@ You do not love electricity cable in the wall .
it is important , but it does not call heart languages . &quot;
this shows that good design and increased area are helping to make something quite ama@@ zing about the usual cor@@ ps .
in fact , they may even give rise to a desire not to leave , as happened with Jo@@ anne .
chief figure , Sir Jen@@ sen , is a ke@@ y@@ stone running in Ch@@ ic@@ ago &apos;s cloud @-@ based village , which is in competition with a colleague for professional res@@ en@@ tment .
there is no other than the amount of money that is earned , with which any ethics is forgotten .
a man of her wife and her three children can only see her hus@@ band in a thi@@ ef and late night .
in the first half of the film , I de@@ em myself thinking that this is the &apos; House of Com@@ m@@ ons &apos; version of the business world - even K@@ ev@@ in S@@ pac@@ ks and Ger@@ ard Bu@@ tle@@ r &apos;s speech man@@ e@@ er are similar .
however , the more film goes on , the less hard@@ ware element remains , and the mor@@ alising intention of film @-@ makers is becoming increasingly apparent .
life @-@ changing experience will mean that the main figure will be cancer in the bo@@ y .
the choice now has to be made between work and family life .
the de@@ sp@@ icable son makes the father think in his wal@@ king visits to Ch@@ ic@@ ago &apos;s major buildings about things that are really important , such as religion , prosperity , love ... , without even tou@@ ching on the disaster of the twin sectors .
after the third po@@ em , where the son opens his eyes , there is a feeling that the film @-@ makers have been guided by the aim of being able to le@@ cture the audience , because even the vis@@ it@@ or of the most basic conscience is unable to hold back te@@ ars in view of the suffering of a lo@@ vely cancer @-@ sick bo@@ y .
when the son falls into the ba@@ g and his situation looks almost hope@@ less , the father understands once and for all the mor@@ als of his work and com@@ pares his work to the old man seeking ch@@ arity .
now I am taking a layer with myself : if a film has a link , I will reward my insight after a film &apos;s coff@@ ee , if I am wrong , I may be commen@@ ded for at least one surprise .
for a moment , there is a suspicion that a baby will be deprived of a seat , when the hus@@ band will call a hospital and the man will rush to the ne@@ ck of a corridor in slow motion .
the bo@@ y has , after all , been mira@@ cul@@ ously healthy , and even though his father has just lost his job , it is also proving to be positive , because now is the time to deal with the family .
I , too , feel comfortable - I can already predict the end of the American dra@@ ma quite well !
in truth , the film is well designed ; all the elements are there .
you can take the but@@ ton , you can lau@@ gh , the actors are a good , moral beau@@ ty : money is not the most important thing in life .
I am surprised that the film is coming in well .
the new staff Com@@ man@@ der intends to limit the President &apos;s media consumption .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps Mr Kelly will actually manage it .
he would then be the first one .
Poli@@ tic@@ o wri@@ tes that the new staff com@@ man@@ der of the White House intends to limit President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in &apos;s flow of information , including news , in the hope that this will keep the excess in excess of water .
here is a full report from Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ se@@ y@@ t :
&apos;@@ W@@ hen the new head of staff of the White House , John F@@ . Kelly , met with high officials on his first day of his work , he pointed out the key problem facing President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i in the White House , which he plans to resolve through the transfer of dis@@ information into the President &apos;s hands .
Kelly told officials that the information must go through him , whether on paper or in meetings , because the President would take better decisions if he were given good information . &quot;
Kelly &apos;s diagnosis seems perfectly logical , but others have tried it too , and they have failed to monitor T@@ ru@@ p &apos;s media consumption .
President T@@ ru@@ p &apos;s relationship with television goes back decades and , even now that he is in the White House , his television watching habits have gone nowhere .
&apos;@@ I@@ f the candidate , Mr T@@ ru@@ mp , was anno@@ yed to show him that he had been fairly reflected in the pres@@ ti@@ gious publications &apos; said the former campaig@@ ner , S@@ am N@@ un@@ berg , in February , to Poli@@ ti@@ co .
Poli@@ tic@@ o f@@ ence Pal@@ mer wrote at the time that &apos; six former campaig@@ ners say that T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter driving is key to ensuring that his own private media consumption includes a stable s@@ ong of praise &apos; .
very well .
but the idea that T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter &apos;s used habits have ever been &apos; controlled &apos; is ridiculous .
perhaps these campaig@@ ners know something that the rest of us do not know about the costs of interoperability T@@ ru@@ mp@@ ire would have been even more hear@@ tening without their interventions .
we will probably never know about the charges that were not passed on by T@@ ru@@ mp .
when his hel@@ ple@@ ss managed to save him even a few times the trouble , his efforts were worth it .
but no one has been able to prevent T@@ ru@@ mp@@ ire from continually sti@@ r@@ ring up controversy .
part of the problem is that in the White House , which is made up of competing cli@@ cks , people are trying , without exception , to promote their own interests by transferring material to the Olympic Games that supports their views on the world stage but may not always be credible .
Poli@@ tic@@ o , which reflects the whole development of the story , wrote strategically questionable information from the advis@@ ers &apos; le@@ an@@ ings to the President of feed in May .
one example , described by Mrs Gold@@ ma@@ cher , is the following :
&quot; the present and former T@@ ru@@ mp@@ ers are saying that T@@ ru@@ mp can react to a negative press , particularly with damaging effects on le@@ af@@ lets , explo@@ ding the idea of finding their source of origin .
this was also the case at the end of February , when someone happily gave a copy of an Internet provo@@ ca@@ tor printed by the President , Charles C. The Joh@@ n@@ son website of G@@ ot@@ New@@ s.@@ Net , a de@@ pu@@ tising de@@ pu@@ der of staff , Ka@@ tie Wal@@ sh@@ i , accused of being the &apos; source of several le@@ aks &apos; in the White House .
it does not matter that Joh@@ n@@ son has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of mo@@ cking , or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he has made false accusations and withdrawn them in the past .
the T@@ ru@@ mp read the article and started asking about Wales , who was subject to it . &quot;
Gold@@ ma@@ cher added that Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , the then head of staff officer Re@@ ince Pri@@ eb@@ us and head of the White House office , had tried to put in place a system to manage and document documents reaching T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in . &quot;
how did it work ?
Mr Kelly is trying to do exactly the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader , but T@@ ru@@ mp will still be an impul@@ se and will continue to compete for influence .
these un@@ changing factors make the Kelly mission very difficult .
street mus@@ ici@@ ans who come from abroad will not get permission to speak .
in the centre of Tallinn , there is a lot of foreigners taking place .
those with whom the con@@ spi@@ ra@@ cy had spoken acknowledged that it was playing in the old town without the permission of the city &apos;s administration .
the first were three street mus@@ ici@@ ans who had taken the same number with them from the virtual gates .
it was clear that mus@@ ici@@ ans with r@@ hy@@ th@@ ms and fra@@ c@@ tured ri@@ ches were behind @-@ the @-@ scen@@ es , to whom one sho@@ ch would be spent .
despite the violence , the only woman in the company played a ru@@ th@@ less r@@ hy@@ th@@ m in a@@ cor@@ di@@ on , while one man , next to her three bal@@ ls , called the fur@@ ni@@ ture closer .
the third man was sitting next to a house in ab@@ sen@@ tia and smo@@ ked a war@@ mer self @-@ prepared ag@@ glom@@ er@@ ations .
their three cha@@ mbers did not allow themselves to be distur@@ bed by the passing people .
Bo@@ b , who played with A@@ cor@@ di@@ on , spoke with No@@ emi and Pal@@ ace , about being pat@@ ron@@ ising in the streets for both fu@@ n and money .
the purpose of the exercise was to collect ticket charges for a ship travelling to Finland the same day in the evening .
the question as to whether they were asking for permission in the old city in order to mus@@ cle was sha@@ king No@@ emi and Bo@@ b &apos;s head .
firstly , we did not know .
secondly , we will never stand in one city for more than a day or a few , and most of them will be granted permits for a month or something like that .
there is no point paying for this , &apos; explained Bo@@ b .
when we got back to the Vir@@ u gates about 20 minutes later , we saw that two women are at mus@@ ici@@ ans and are driving them away .
the exhibition with the ba@@ il@@ outs and the do@@ gs of the Vir@@ u Centre came to the test of happ@@ iness .
there were also three Polish young men on the Vir@@ u street , one of whom played sign , the other was ch@@ lar@@ ing , and the third had even carried an electronic glass .
&quot; we are here to give people a feeling of enter@@ tainment to spread music and joy and to earn money for fuel and living , &quot; explained the tri@@ o from the pi@@ pe M@@ iv@@ os@@ h .
according to M@@ iv@@ o@@ sh@@ i , they are aware that the city authorities must be allowed to speak .
&apos;@@ We do not have it of course &apos; , he said so jo@@ king .
but we hope that if people enjoy our music , there will be no problem .
of course , when the police come , we go elsewhere but have to try &apos; , he added .
in July , the Estonian Central Bank purchased EUR 149 million in bonds under a public asset buying programme of central banks in the euro area , and the Central Bank bond portfolio increased to a total of EUR 4.@@ 36 billion .
the Central Bank does not publish more detailed information on purchases .
Har@@ do H@@ ans@@ son , President of the Bank of Estonia , has previously explained , in response to a request from members of the National Assembly , that the plan for the assets of the central banks of the Euro@@ system includes three different purchasing programmes : covered bonds ( interoperability ) , asset @-@ backed bonds ( A@@ B@@ S ) and public bonds ( PS@@ PP ) .
the Central Bank is buying up bonds on the market in order to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere .
purchases have an impact on lower @-@ risk asset productivity and encourage investors to take bigger risks .
as a rule , in the framework of the public bond purchasing programme , each central bank bu@@ ys its government bonds , while other government bonds are not purchased .
as the Estonian State has not issued bonds , the Estonian bank will make so @-@ called substitu@@ tes within the allocated volume .
central banks are also buying up in those countries where the offer of the bonds corresponding to the purchase scheme is limited .
according to Mr H@@ ans@@ son , the Bank of Estonia generally bu@@ ys bonds from the European institutions , such as the European Financial Stability Fund and European Investment Bank bonds .
as of March 2015 , the Bank of Estonia will purchase bonds under its asset buying programme .
Ele@@ ring bonds were also obtained in the meantime , but in June 2016 the Estonian bank will no longer buy Ele@@ circu@@ it bonds .

some of the most aff@@ lu@@ ent owners of the West Mid@@ lands have once again found themselves in a fier@@ ce confrontation with determined travellers , who have ignored the cra@@ dle du@@ mped by the Council in order to win back from their cotton .
migrants have flo@@ wn their 20 tra@@ i@@ ler f@@ ences on the streets of a prosperous &quot; one million business lines &quot; cros@@ sed by the So@@ meat ul@@ l .
they have returned with the army of hor@@ ses , children and lorries after they were thrown out there only in May , without being thrown away by the bureaucracy du@@ mped to prevent their invasion by the Council .
the group found a weak position in the protective limits , turning its vehicles from the un@@ blocked part left through which it was left to football .
M@@ har@@ den@@ ed residents have fle@@ w to the So@@ meat Council by saying that the Council is &apos; useless in dealing with the problem &apos; .
a anon@@ ymous resident said : &apos; they moved there on Monday evening after they were expelled from Ben@@ tle@@ y He@@ ath@@ ist , where they st@@ oned fur@@ ni@@ ture .
the Council must be ashamed to take action because they are useless in dealing with the problem .
the migrants were there in May , they were forced to go and now they are back again .
there were more of them yesterday evening , probably more today . &quot;
he added : &apos; Bir@@ min@@ g@@ ha@@ m Council knows how to deal with such matters by obtaining long barriers to protect its par@@ ks .
I live on the street , and I am not satisfied that I have to continue to pay the G@@ over@@ ning Board if the Council cannot even block such a thing . &quot;
a local resident who also wanted to remain anon@@ ymous said : &apos; it is ridiculous ; we have just seen how the latter left these travellers , and a new offensive is already under way .
this time the number has risen and the horse has even ru@@ ined in the grass@@ land . &quot;
the representative of the So@@ meat Council said : &apos; we are aware that the land near the street eth@@ s@@ bro@@ o@@ k road is an unacceptable camp pla@@ te and we are working with the So@@ meat ul@@ l police ; we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible .
it is very helpful to gather evidence when as many local residents as possible report any antis@@ o@@ cial or criminal behaviour to the police , calling the number 101 .
this will help to create a picture of the situation for the Court when we present the case . &quot;
the We@@ ek@@ end festi@@ val will be visited by Minister for Culture In@@ dre@@ k Sa@@ ar , among others , who is pleased that it has been possible to bring real top names to Estonia .
the question as to why it is so important for Est@@ oni@@ ans on the We@@ ek@@ end festi@@ val is that it should be asked by all those who enjoy the full stories of the festi@@ val for three days .
he says , however , that real players have arrived in Per@@ sia .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen you look at the level of artists that has been brought to Estonia , the absolute top names of this mus@@ ical j@@ uni@@ or - which often does not happen in our body - are brought home by the Minister of Culture . &apos;
which artists in the festi@@ val , however , are speaking most about Sa@@ art itself ?
I consider myself to be a relatively old and , for people like me , one of the most experienced doctors , Ar@@ min van B@@ ü@@ re@@ n , who stood up yesterday evening .
after all , at some point , all of us , all of us , with his pla@@ ti@@ tudes , have got their feet on their feet . &quot;
he does , however , highlight a number of other names , such as Cha@@ in@@ solidarity , De@@ ad@@ ma@@ u@@ 5 , K@@ ni@@ fe@@ din .
of course , our own Estonian players too : starting with NO@@ MO@@ P , they can be read in a whole series .
in reality , the concentration of names known as &apos; is very high &apos; , he says .

car manufacturers are being driven by up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the midst of criticism of car manufacturers
the day before the Au@@ di announcement , B@@ M@@ W said it would offer software coverage to more than 350 000 vehicles .
according to the Chairman of B@@ M@@ W , the company believes that &apos; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions &apos; , referring to European cities , including the home town of B@@ M@@ W , Munich , which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles .
Da@@ im@@ ler announced on Tuesday that he will renew 3 million Mercedes &apos;s vehicles in Europe to reduce emissions from diesel engines .
they were not described by any company as a form of re@@ vo@@ cation .
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions .
nitrogen ox@@ ide em@@ itted from diesel engines , however , is considered to be carcinogenic and can cause as@@ th@@ ma .
at the same time , the cost of equipment intended to counteract diesel emissions by the automobile industry is increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
while German car manufacturers are under thorough investigation , the Federal Chancellor , Angela Merkel , is accused of le@@ c@@ turing the powerful car manufacturers and of ignoring the signs referring to the problem .
companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen , who remained silent about the use of so @-@ called &apos; sca@@ m devices &apos; , which made it possible to adapt the gas gu@@ ides to the regulations at the time of testing a car , but have withdrawn in normal driving conditions .
several Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen leaders have been indi@@ cted in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , a former head of the Au@@ di engine Development unit was arrested in Germany .
former President Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Gi@@ o@@ van@@ ni Pa@@ mi@@ o is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may be prosecuted in the United States .
earlier this year , the Au@@ di was drawn into a criminal investigation into Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen in Germany , where the authorities accused the Audit System of being installed in order to circum@@ vent the requirements for European emissions , thereby extending the investigation , which had previously been focused on the United States .
the inclusion of the prize in the investigation may be a major blow to the Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen Agency by a manufacturer of connected luxury cars generating a disproportionate share of the Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen profits .
Estonian schools are acquiring the flags of the European Union for EUR 20 000 .
the Ministry of Education intends to buy the flags of the European Union to mark the Presidency by 1 September .
in total , the European Union flag of 5@@ 70 educational institutions will be measured by 105@@ x@@ 15@@ 8 c@@ enti@@ metres .
they are intended to be ex@@ hi@@ b@@ iting in in@@ door spaces and must also be carried out in high @-@ quality printed material in@@ doors with an at@@ testa@@ tion , an ER@@ R news@@ portal .
the simple label reads : &apos; authorisation for Estonian schools to mention the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union .
the estimated cost of 5@@ 70 flags is € 20 000 at the Ministry of Education price , or one flag costs € 35 .
journalist murder highlights growing danger in Mexico
weekly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers usually gather on Wednesday to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the Blue State , so@@ wn by organised crime , corrupt officials and un@@ ce@@ asing drugs wars .
but today , under the cover of a personal tragedy , they have gathered to discuss their own security .
they are told that it is important to change their ru@@ ins .
two senior wri@@ ters are discussing which seems safer : either to bring children with them into an office that was the target of a gran@@ dio@@ se attack in 2009 , or to leave them home .
security experts have written three words to the will in charge of the space : &apos; enemies &apos; , &apos; neutral &apos; , &apos; allies &apos; .
they ask the repor@@ ters to give each ve@@ il &apos;s names no need , it is sufficient impres@@ sions and in@@ ner feelings .
in being on the pay@@ roll of the government or car@@ tels , the list of drug traffickers , politicians , business@@ men and journalists is suspected of being evil people who make it dangerous to reflect the chaos in Mexico .
the violence is not a b@@ reat@@ h of b@@ reat@@ h and the more dead across the country , the greater the proportion of which journalists make up , according to the Committee for the Protection of S@@ co@@ ck@@ ers , since President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Len@@ to was e@@ rec@@ ted in December 2012 , will be at least 25 : 5@@ 89 journalists will be subject to state protection after attacks and threats , and this year at least seven journalists will still have died in seven states .
the latest deaths include their edit@@ or and source of inspiration , co @-@ foun@@ der of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den .
&apos;@@ The greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist &apos; wrote Val@@ dez in one of its many books on drug violence .
his absence is deeply felt , even though his presence may be felt throughout the morning of the construction of the telecom Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building , a big picture of the finger @-@ pointing Val@@ de@@ z with the letter of &apos; fairness &apos; , and two of the 30 reports , A@@ ar@@ on I@@ bar@@ ra and M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez , carry T @-@ shir@@ ts showing a face or a pan@@ op@@ a@@ mic bar@@ rel that character@@ ises him .
Re@@ por@@ ters discuss common trau@@ ma , their n@@ ight@@ m@@ are , dre@@ ams , paran@@ o@@ ia .
although a separate national prosecution service was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists &apos; cases , only two cases have been brought before the Committee on the Protection of journalists .
as in the case of most annual murders involving drug trafficking and organised crime , the number of which amounts to thousands , journalists &apos; kil@@ lers rarely come to justice .
the action of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce will continue to reflect the violence in Sin@@ al@@ os , even though their hearts have been broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous .
without murde@@ rers &apos; data and justice , the meeting on security , I@@ bar@@ ra , says , will be of little use .
&apos;@@ It is very nice to waste your time in this meeting , &apos; he says .
&apos;@@ As long as the cause is unknown , you will trust everyone &apos; .
Val@@ dez left the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce office in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , State capital , on the morning of 15 May .
he was able to travel only a few quarters before two men stopped red To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Co@@ rol@@ la ; he was forced to leave the car and was shot 12 times , presu@@ ma@@ bly because of the name of the newspaper , which trans@@ lates as &apos; the twel@@ f@@ th river &apos; .
an armed man went to the car in Val@@ dez and made an accident close to it .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
she and two adult children were left behind .
the rum@@ ours spread freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
however , there is basically only silence on the Val@@ dez issue .
since the arrest of Gu@@ z@@ man last year and the extradition to the United States in January , Blue authorisation has been one of the country &apos;s most bloody bat@@ tle@@ fields , as ri@@ val cli@@ cks are fighting to fill a power vacuum .
it does not matter that , on the streets of the blue licence , a person or even several people are shot down every day or that the dead are ri@@ d@@ dled with the double @-@ hul@@ ls so@@ rely dec@@ re@@ ed , which are greater than many homes living .
let us forget for a moment that the time for peace indicates just one car@@ tel running at sea with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States .
despite all this and the fact that Val@@ dez was fully aware of the dangers of its work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , co @-@ foun@@ der and President of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , feels deeply innocent that he was unable to protect his friend .
he believes that two errors contributed to this killing .
the first was the publication in February of an interview with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons , who were competing with and who were in war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons , the r@@ hin@@ ame@@ tre D@@ amas@@ o L@@ ope@@ z .
this piece of correspon@@ dence may have been allu@@ ded to by the ruling members who are suspected of being present to buy all cop@@ ies of publication as soon as they reached the shel@@ ves of the newspaper .
the second mistake was that Val@@ dez was not forced to leave the country in the name of his own security after the crackdown took place in another newspaper delivery that reflected the same story .
Val@@ dez was a leg@@ end both in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico .
he had lived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would be there forever .
he worked as a ve@@ ter@@ an@@ repor@@ ter at No@@ ro@@ es in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , selling 50 @-@ dollar parts .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said that in Sin@@ al@@ o &apos; it was impossible to deal with the press without being affected by the drug problem &apos; .
the newspaper ran out of touch with its courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
Re@@ por@@ ters were keen to express strong studies without the fear of censorship and read@@ ers in a fasc@@ in@@ ating publication from which they could read stories that no one else da@@ red to report .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the newspaper won a pres@@ ti@@ gious Maria Mo@@ ors C@@ ab@@ ot Prize for her Latin American reports .
in the same year , the Committee for the Protection of journalists ( AK@@ K ) won the International Press Freedom Prize for its courage to follow the Mexic@@ an drug story wherever it leads .
he openly admitted that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to live on , &quot; he said when he received the AK@@ K prize .
last October , he told the television channel Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ en@@ to in an interview that drug trafficking was a way of life in S@@ ho@@ al@@ o@@ a .
&quot; to embrace the challenge that journalists &apos; office has to face now is to play around .
I do not want to be asked what I did or why I did not say what is going on in the face of so many deaths . &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce colle@@ gi@@ ate long for a teacher of Val@@ dez , a jo@@ ke who ro@@ cked like a mad@@ ness , a friend who kind@@ ly shared embry@@ os and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they supported his rou@@ tine .
he was always we@@ aring his bar@@ rel .
he moved from office to El Guatem@@ y@@ ab@@ o bar and was always on the same s@@ ong .
now they are asking whether his rou@@ tine love became fatal to him .
his death has also led them to doubt how best to do their work and stay alive .
&quot; they do not like the ri@@ gi@@ d@@ ity of their women , their children , their legitimate businesses , with their secret landing pla@@ tes used to transport drugs . &quot;
&apos;@@ Th@@ ese things should not be touched , &apos; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result , even in the best times , will be strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ confidence .
trust in your in@@ st@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sme@@ ars suspi@@ ci@@ ously , it do@@ es@@ n &apos;t .
the problem , according to the edit@@ or @-@ in @-@ chief of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , And@@ res Vil@@ lar@@ rez , is that &apos; the fra@@ gran@@ ce can be de@@ cep@@ ted ... and that is how it happened with J@@ any . &apos;
he and others say that the old rules no longer apply in M@@ al@@ os , just as they do not apply in Ta@@ ma@@ u@@ li@@ pa@@ sis , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Guer@@ re@@ ros or other states , which are home to the toxic composition of lu@@ cra@@ tive smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt state officials .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the space where Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers met for security training , mobile phones were suddenly no longer permitted ; a few days before that , it was revealed that only a but@@ ton sold to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
in front of the house , two police officers sought relief from a 40 degree bul@@ let under the gu@@ ise of a t@@ ree .
they have been appointed by the government to the office of the State o@@ do@@ ce , located in a four @-@ point building in the centre of the Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an neighbourhood .
some repor@@ ters won@@ dered , half @-@ jo@@ king , whether these police officers are among the 50 % police officers that the Governor himself has dis@@ credi@@ ted .
several months have passed since reports have moved to mountainous areas where control is de facto in the hands of drug gan@@ gs .
this week &apos;s report by Mr Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce covered three main a@@ xes .
one of them was the murder in Sin@@ al@@ o@@ a of former bo@@ xing leg@@ end Ju@@ li@@ o Lamber@@ ar Cha@@ vez bro@@ na .
moreover , they had a reve@@ aling story of the spending of government funds on the town of the Governor &apos;s home town .
and people were kidna@@ pped by one of the most expensive restaur@@ ants , from Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an to Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , from office to quarter .
there was no official announcement of who was kidna@@ pped or how this happened , so caution had to be exercised when it came to writing what all cities knew as a place for drug traffickers and authorities alike .
the report found out from the public documents that the restaur@@ ant has been registered as a politician who belongs to the ruling institution , the Rev@@ olu@@ tionary Party ( IR@@ P ) , which dominated all levels of policy for almost the whole last century .
recently , several IR@@ P Governor has been accused of corruption in court cases with wide coverage .
in Vil@@ lar@@ real , the report asked the repor@@ ter to write previous incidents in the same place , including how the son of Gu@@ z@@ man , who is we@@ aring the name El Chap@@ o , esca@@ ped a military record .
only a few months earlier , read@@ ers would have been looking to Val@@ dez &apos;s co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il to obtain information on kidna@@ pping from the best sources .
&apos;@@ In the past , we would have already known what happened , &apos; said a 46 @-@ year @-@ old Vil@@ lar@@ line whose bro@@ ker &apos;s body construction deserves a sh@@ ou@@ ting name for him , El Fla@@ co .
&quot; now all channels of communication have broken down with our sources . &quot;
the Val@@ dez office has become savings on labels and stic@@ kers protesting against the killing of journalists , and the edit@@ orial staff have become something they could never have expected in the name of the press .
next morning , Re@@ por@@ ter M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez took a few eyes and moved to the c@@ abinet of the local public Prosecutor for yet another journalist &apos;s sake .
Mr Salvador A@@ bad in the western state of Mic@@ ho@@ ac@@ an three days after the killing of Val@@ dez .
a dead body has been found and , according to the officials , it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests .
journalists across the country have become more vo@@ cal and highlight the words &apos; S@@ OS press &apos; as an organised protest against the th@@ ug@@ s and buildings .
on that day , the President , Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , is in Washington , trying to gather international support in the Val@@ dez case to get justice right .
the day after the death of Val@@ dez in meetings with the Governor of S@@ mit@@ ry , the Ra@@ mi@@ rez authorities accused journalists of c@@ rying and killing them of telling the truth .
after that , he asked that he be diver@@ ted from government activity , worrying that he had an influence on objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that Mexic@@ an journalists were &apos; restricted &apos; by organised crime , compli@@ cit state officials and an indifferent society .
in his recent book &apos; Drug press &apos; , he wrote that repor@@ ters not only kill drugs gan@@ gs , but also , at the be@@ h@@ est of politicians and security forces , who are in contact with organised crime .
Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 , the media monitoring group , assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and state officials last year .
&quot; in Mexico you connect because you want to keep quiet , &quot; said Ra@@ mi@@ rez .
murder obviously has a bloody effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ g@@ ger Maria E@@ liz@@ abeth Ma@@ ci@@ as in the northern border state of Ta@@ ma@@ u@@ li@@ pa@@ sis six years ago .
his body was found together with a letter which I think was signed by the car@@ tel L@@ OS Z@@ e@@ tas : &apos; I am here for my reports &apos; .
next to his land@@ lor@@ inated head , computer glass and head@@ phones were found .
some publications have decided to close their doors , for example , in the northern border state of El Nor@@ te , Chi@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ a , after the killing by March of their correspon@@ dent , Mrs B@@ org@@ h .
others are dra@@ gging on as they did after the murder of their President in 2004 in El Man@@ ana de Nu@@ ev@@ o L@@ are@@ do .
in 2010 , the newspaper Di@@ ari@@ o de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z spoke in public about the front page of the drug car@@ tel &apos; What do you want of us ? &apos;
some journalists have fled from home states or even from the country .
this is a ner@@ v@@ ous decision .
A@@ x@@ ony is hard to find work , and they still have to han@@ g onto the streets in order to avoid dangers .
and sometimes they are being hun@@ ted behind , as is probably the case with photo@@ graphic Ru@@ be@@ n E@@ sp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 in a Mexico corridor with four women , three months after Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z had fled .
those who remain in place and continue to work must dance around risky decisions on a daily basis .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to become a po@@ et , recognises that reporting drugs trafficking sca@@ res him .
&quot; Mexico is on its way to hell , and that is why I am going to report , &quot; he said .
in a recent mid@@ night on Friday , when the latest number had already gone down , the edit@@ orial staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat on a th@@ or@@ n in front of the office and loo@@ ted a be@@ er when it suddenly began to cal@@ ib@@ rate all the phones .
in Ma@@ z@@ at@@ lan@@ i , a ri@@ val city of ri@@ val gan@@ gs and security forces had claimed 19 deaths .
the war continued to es@@ tu@@ alise , as did many of the messages left by the car@@ tels found in the region .
on the basis of the same hard line , repor@@ ters pic@@ ked up the news on the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce website using a mobile phone .
it was necessary to change the front of next day .
the ra@@ mi@@ fications hu@@ m@@ bled through this new exchange of fire in the region .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez pa@@ ved towards on @-@ call police officers to see whether they are vigilant .
if they fea@@ red it , they did not at least show it .
under the massive t@@ ree of the de@@ scen@@ dant &apos;s foot@@ wear , where his average finger can be seen in the whole of his blue room , the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers were delivered in his foot@@ steps .
&apos;@@ Ho@@ w can one think of closing down at all &apos; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &apos; whereas on the very day Javier killed , a tra@@ ine@@ e asked me to report back to the streets ? &apos;
D@@ in@@ osa pressure used defence col@@ ours to prevent enemies
at first sight , it looks like a form , albeit rather frigh@@ tening .
scientists have now made public the first findings regarding the un@@ beli@@ evable assumption of the r@@ all@@ ot@@ ry size discovered by the Canadian min@@ er , which has so well preserved that the experts have described it as &apos; a Lis@@ at of the din@@ departments Mon@@ a . &apos;
it has survi@@ ved so well that it was even possible to establish that the sk@@ in covered by his soya was a colour of the red @-@ box Brown , and his past had been somewhat &apos; complicated &apos; .
the present Bi@@ ology report described the status quo as &apos; the best preserved piece of gender pressure that has ever been found &apos; and &apos; one of the best din@@ ni@@ ture worldwide &apos; .
fossil is a new type of no@@ do@@ sa@@ ic pressure lived in the middle of the cri@@ cket era , 110 @-@ 112 million years ago .
the incredibly good maintenance of this was provided by theat@@ res describing it as &apos; truly remarkable &apos; .
this her@@ bal feed covered by soya is the best preserved type of ph@@ os@@ ph@@ orus ever found , according to National Ge@@ o@@ broadcasting .
it was found on 21 March 2011 when he extra@@ cted the Sun@@ c@@ or Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um mine near For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in northern Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he struck something that did not remember the th@@ read around him and decided to look into it in greater detail .
the detected ph@@ os@@ ph@@ orus was sent to the Pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ology M@@ use@@ um of Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell .
for the next six years , the animal was working to extra@@ ct 2 500 women ( 1 100 kilometres ) from the land area .
after all this hard work , the end result is now finally ready to be made public .
&apos;@@ I@@ f a bit of a bridge is tor@@ n up , one can almost believe that he is s@@ le@@ ep , &apos; said the leader , Cal@@ e@@ b Brown , a scien@@ tist , in the muse@@ um of the Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell , where the present is expon@@ ential .
&apos;@@ This will go down in scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved members of the din@@ osa , Mon@@ a Lis@@ ana . &apos;
in his investigation into lea@@ ther , he found that this animal feed , although covered by soya and re@@ minis@@ cent of a wal@@ king tan@@ k , was likely to be significantly threatened by feed pressure .
this cur@@ few so@@ cks used a red and white defence colour to hide from pre@@ da@@ tors and applied shel@@ ters technology , which is called shelter and is also used by many today &apos;s animals .
this allowed , according to experts , the din@@ osa@@ ur to become better integrated around and to avoid enemies , since the major din@@ n@@ ous pressure was likely to hun@@ t him .
this 110 million @-@ year @-@ old family of no@@ do@@ main@@ s first entered the news in May and is now visiting Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell &apos;s Pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ology M@@ use@@ um .
the researchers have now studied being and given it the name of Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta Mar@@ mit@@ hel@@ li , according to mark Mitchell , the muse@@ um of Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta , a famous team that spent more than 7 000 hours trying to reveal it in a difficult way .
thanks to the ama@@ zing preservation of the father &apos;s father , Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists have been able to document the shape and size of the so@@ cks on the body .
they found a shadow - a common method of protection in the country of animal origin , which means that the ti@@ p of existence was the port as the bottom of the sea .
although the shelter is ri@@ fe , the findings come as a surprise , since Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta is much larger than today live with over@@ sha@@ do@@ wed animals .
it suggests that the din@@ osa@@ ur hun@@ ts were sufficiently active in other mus@@ cle feed sur@@ ger@@ y that the evolution preferred to be over@@ sha@@ do@@ wed instead of opposing the survival ta@@ ctic .
however , most of the animals that use today &apos;s shel@@ ters - for example , fears , pig be@@ ans or sc@@ ars - are much smaller and more vulnerable as an island , which suggests that the no@@ sa@@ ic pressure had to make a real effort to survive .
&apos;@@ A vigorous hun@@ t @-@ up of the enormous and ab@@ un@@ dance of heat @-@ covered din@@ share shows just how dangerous pre@@ da@@ tors may have been from the g@@ ho@@ sts of the cri@@ cket era , &apos; Brown said .
the chemical analysis of organic comp@@ ounds of So@@ om@@ ers also revealed that the din@@ share pressure sk@@ in was a red box .
scientists will continue to investigate this life , including the content of this war@@ mon@@ gering style , in order to find out what the animal is going to eat in their last wave .
they believe that the din@@ osa@@ ur has plun@@ ged the river to death , thus ending up in a sea in which he has turned his back in front of the ocean bed .
at that time , Alber@@ tas was as warm as it is today in Southern Flor@@ ence , and rivers and oceans are likely to extend far beyond the internal area as they are today .
&quot; this no@@ do@@ sa@@ ic pressure is truly significant as it is fully covered by soya @-@ like sk@@ in , while remaining three dimensions , preserving the original shape of the animal , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; as a result , today &apos;s animal looks almost the same as in the bo@@ iling age .
there is not a great deal of imagination to be used to recon@@ stru@@ ct it - it is enough simply to te@@ ar our eyes on our eyes and it seems as if he is s@@ lee@@ ping . &apos;
the crisis era was the time when vast two leg@@ s of meat feed sur@@ f@@ ers - he@@ tero@@ gene@@ ous shops - were s@@ tun@@ ned on the land .
although King Ty@@ ran@@ no@@ sa@@ ur@@ us re@@ x of all of them lived millions of years later than Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta , some of his for@@ mi@@ dable predecess@@ ors could have been hun@@ ted down by this su@@ ici@@ dal din@@ share .
these include A@@ cro@@ can@@ tho@@ l , 38 leg@@ s ( 11.@@ 5 metres ) in a long and six @-@ tonne mon@@ ster .
scientists whose recent findings are published in today &apos;s Bi@@ ology magaz@@ ine believe that Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta was dro@@ w@@ ned into the sea after death and this mu@@ mi@@ fied .
on 21 March 2011 , Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when mining in Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um , For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray near Northern Alber@@ ta , found its existence in Canada .
according to the muse@@ um , it is the best preserved part of the world , including sk@@ in and soya , and it is a complete concentration up to in@@ sec@@ tici@@ de .
these were on average 18 leg@@ s ( five metres ) long and can@@ vas@@ sed at up to GBP 3 000 ( 13@@ 00 kg ) .
two 20 customs terms inva@@ ded Pand@@ ora &apos;s length on its shoulders .
scientists believe that this piece of flora and fauna covered by soya bat@@ tered through the present Western Canada until the open water of the floo@@ ded river .
however , the under@@ sea place of the din@@ part pressure helped to preserve its contents in an excellent detail .
the rem@@ nan@@ ts of this particular father &apos;s stone have survi@@ ved so well that the ti@@ tles of the my@@ g@@ arch@@ ies of so@@ om@@ ers are still covered by sk@@ in rem@@ nan@@ ts .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko &apos;s magaz@@ ine National Ge@@ o@@ interoperability wrote : &apos; such a survival rate is as rare as a l@@ ot@@ tery .
the more I look at it , the more incredible it seems .
the bur@@ nt @-@ out sk@@ in residues continue to cover the my@@ ste@@ rious so@@ om@@ ers on the y@@ el@@ low of the animal .
a better front be@@ ats her side and the five thi@@ ev@@ es have been pul@@ led up@@ wards .
I will be able to read the so@@ cks that he has on winter . &quot;
how did one activist find an answer to the question &apos; whose thanks ? &apos;
on 9 August 2014 , Bri@@ t@@ tan@@ y Ferre@@ ll was completely shocked .
just one day after the trip to New York , it was father : St@@ Lou@@ is resident , through his ren@@ ted room , on a phone Facebook page .
he got on to the post of his former fellow country@@ man .
it reads : &apos; the police have just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old youth , and he is still lying on the street &apos; .
he was confused why no one else had posted this information on his stream , which is why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
P@@ ide@@ ga @ The@@ e@@ P@@ ha@@ ah user &apos;s postal services have been distributed several times along his time@@ line .
St@@ . S@@ hell , from the Lou@@ is region , conve@@ yed in real time a sh@@ ining book about the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed 18 @-@ year @-@ old black young man who was killed by a white police officer in Fer@@ gus@@ oni Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is .
he posted a picture of the life of Bro@@ w@@ n in a body that was found on the street , leaving it for four hours .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at is cra@@ zy , &apos; said Ferre@@ ll &apos;s bro@@ thers .
but death was nothing new for him or for his community .
he put his phone off , but later this evening he re@@ saw the spar@@ k announced that people had gathered in Can@@ field D@@ ri@@ ve .
P@@ ho@@ tos of police and sh@@ ell@@ fish people and a man who claimed to be the father of Brown and kept the label &apos; the Fer@@ gus@@ on police killed my un@@ armed son &apos; .
he looked in real time at the stream where the police officer stood before a group of prote@@ sters with a grave dog .
in the second video , another police officer , he said , &apos; I kill you all ... animals &apos; .
Fer@@ rell is reminded of how he caught himself from the idea of &apos; that is unusual &apos; .
&apos;@@ This is not the kind of murder to which we are ac@@ custo@@ med and which we could describe as typical &apos; .
I felt frigh@@ tened at that point .
I was ang@@ ry and c@@ rying &apos; .
he boo@@ ked a return flight and travelled home the next day .
having bu@@ ried at 23 o &apos;@@ clock , he went to his father for his six @-@ year @-@ old da@@ u@@ ghter and decided that they would be travelling to the tw@@ o@@ fold Fer@@ gus@@ on next morning .
what happened to Fer@@ rell and Fer@@ gus@@ on over the next three years will be the focus of a new docu@@ mentary &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street ? &apos; ( whom do you thank ? ) , which will be presented in cine@@ mas on 11 August .
it is a story of survival and protest , of love and defeat , of strength and resilience from the point of view of those people who live in this community and who , by demanding answers , took to the streets .
when the Ferre@@ ll , along with a da@@ u@@ ghter - who had a flow@@ er bro@@ ker on his back and had a good k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les on it - went to Fer@@ gus@@ on , they talked again about the experience and living conditions of the black men , which had been discussed many times before this morning .
&apos;@@ D@@ o you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights ? &apos; it reminds itself of asking .
&apos;@@ We are currently travelling to Fer@@ gus@@ on because an 18 @-@ year @-@ old bo@@ y was killed by the police , and that is not right &apos; .
&apos;@@ I could not take him along , &apos; said Ferre@@ ll later .
&apos;@@ What is happening now is ... the cul@@ mination of past events .
it must know and see this and grow in the middle of it .
he must learn about the organisation and organisation of an activist , while also knowing the different la@@ yers of experience and living conditions for the black people , and what we have to do in order to be free and free .
even if I manage to bring him up in such a way that he does not experience blatant racism in person , he is no different from some other black girls .
I feel I would be doing him a dis@@ service if I were to protect him from this world . &quot;
the first suspension they made at the time of the Fer@@ gus@@ on was on the way to South Flor@@ is@@ san@@ ti , a place beyond the police force that had become a kind of camp site where activists were waiting for news about the police officer , Dar@@ re@@ n Wil@@ son , who was not charged at the end of the day .
on that occasion , Ferre@@ ll and his da@@ u@@ ghter joined forces with local business@@ men who made southern ski@@ es .
they put together food bags and helped to distribute them to prote@@ sters .
for Fer@@ rell , a new type of activist has slowly begun to take shape .
&apos;@@ My activist changed completely after 9 August &apos; , he said , stating that when he was a student at Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i @-@ St@@ . Lou@@ is University , he was the President of the Association of National students of cancer and focused on food justice and health inequalities within Muslim communities .
&quot; I had no organisation experience .
it all just broke out . &apos;
a week later , Mrs Fo@@ la@@ yan@@ i , a film co @-@ director , met during the Ferre@@ ll evening demonstration .
Mr Fo@@ lay@@ an said that he and the film operator Lucas Al@@ var@@ ad@@ o @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r simply wanted to document what is happening .
in the face of Fer@@ rell , the question arises as to &apos; are you going to try to document what is happening or to find a story that can be exploited ? &apos;
such scepticism was due to countless cases where people - often white - come into the community and try to profit from its protein and resilience .
the Fo@@ lay@@ an explained in a recent interview : &apos; we have heard that the voice of people born in Fer@@ gus@@ on and growing up in Fer@@ gus@@ on will not be heard and we wanted to do so otherwise &apos; .
Fo@@ lay@@ an had already raised its hands with D@@ am@@ on Da@@ vis , the regional ar@@ tist known for his activist in relation to sentenced prisoners .
his involvement made the project attractive for Fer@@ rell and another six local communities , followed for years by the W@@ ho@@ se street ? &apos; team following the shooting of Bro@@ w@@ n .
&quot; in this docu@@ mentary no one speaks for us , no one speaks for us , no one speaks to us , but for us , &apos; said Da@@ vis .
&apos;@@ It was important to me how these people were portra@@ yed , because that is how I am de@@ pic@@ ted &apos; .
although the aim was not to focus on the experience of Fer@@ rell - it was intended to show that the movement was not &apos; a head of sal@@ vation but a community coming together &apos; , as Mr Fo@@ lay@@ an said - he made a film the most open .
as a result , the &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street ? &apos; document surpris@@ ingly personal aspects of the life of Fer@@ rell , such as mer@@ cy and marriage with his wife .
&apos;@@ I felt as if I was na@@ ked , &apos; said Ferre@@ ll , s@@ mil@@ ing over the first time that he had seen a piece of urban work .
&quot; but I understood that there had to be a certain vulnerability to do this work and to human@@ ise the black people . &quot;
moreover , the Fer@@ rell story underlines and puts the role of the black homo@@ sexual woman in the wider Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement at the centre again .
two of the three initi@@ ators of the movement who thought in the social media after the killing of the black teen@@ ag@@ er Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 are homo@@ sexual : # Bla@@ ck@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter .
&quot; in leading roles , black , homo@@ sexual women have generally maintained the movement , &quot; said Ferre@@ ll , &quot; precisely because we have to fight continually on several fronts .
Roma homo@@ sexual women must bear the full burden . &quot;
the Fo@@ lay@@ an agreed , stating that &apos; the movement is indeed kept alive by black women and many of them are black , homo@@ sexual women &apos; .
at the same time , he says that &apos; this is not a kind of matter of equal opportunities &apos; - Fer@@ rell was not the focus of the film chosen for his identity .
&apos;@@ H@@ e was a man from whom the right energy was le@@ an@@ ed &apos; he said .
&quot; but it is no coincidence that she was directly situated on the front line , because there is much at stake as a black homo@@ sexual woman living in such hu@@ bs .
his energy can be perceived on the screen . &quot;
at the same time , the news camer@@ as Fer@@ gus@@ on have long disappeared , but racial ties between the community and the police are still fragile .
the conditional sentences imposed on the Fer@@ rell during the demonstration for blocking the road route will last for another 2.5 years .
he describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere in the region he calls home as simply a &apos; huge free threat &apos; .
nevertheless , it still attaches great importance to the man@@ tra it has ea@@ ten since it first took to the streets of Fer@@ gus@@ on as long as three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose except our chains . &quot;
7 T@@ o find out after the We@@ ek@@ ent &apos;s pi@@ le of po@@ pp@@ y
some of the more stu@@ b@@ born me@@ ters find help after their me@@ ag@@ re pi@@ pe , even though they are suffering from it .
or from the saying &apos; avoid po@@ ch@@ ol@@ li , break the py@@ ra@@ mid &apos; .
but this is just the inevitable postponement and proper res@@ on@@ ance to health .
what can you do to make sure that , after today &apos;s and tomorrow &apos;s We@@ ek@@ end tr@@ ale - or other pi@@ pe - you feel better and get out of the po@@ t as pain@@ lessly as possible this morning ?
Jo@@ o Water .
alcohol was cut down and down , after a lot of pi@@ pe in the morning ... or , if possible , not even alcohol .
as the body loses a lot of liquids when it consu@@ mes alcohol , it must somehow be recovered .
together with water , miner@@ als are also s@@ tun@@ ned out of the body , and the comp@@ ound is a good ha@@ ir &apos;s mineral water .
since the machine is often irri@@ tated after d@@ rying , it is particularly good that it is soil @-@ free or has only been taken ligh@@ tly .
go and walk .
surely it would not be worth going to the grand@@ mother with po@@ ch@@ ol@@ l to bur@@ st trees - it could be a fatal wrong decision .
but an easy process will help the body to remember again what it is like to be alive .
S@@ hu@@ ff@@ ling and be@@ ating out a bo@@ y is a more time @-@ consuming way of getting a healthy diet .
give the body energy back slowly and cau@@ ti@@ ously .
if you are already on track from yesterday &apos;s over@@ run , it is certainly not worth trying to pay a heavy fat .
to begin with , for example , with the new volume of fruit containing t@@ res@@ ses to qui@@ et@@ ly pro@@ p up their bodies .
if health on the south is already suffering , one could try to get a w@@ ed@@ ding bear , for example .
and a little later on , a little bit more .
no coff@@ ee was issued .
this di@@ u@@ re@@ tics is rele@@ asing your body of the last water .
as has already been said , water and volume have your friends .
contribute to anal@@ ge@@ si@@ cs .
if you take a pain@@ kil@@ ler this evening to prevent po@@ ison@@ ing , then you have to deal not only with alcohol but also with a on @-@ board ta@@ ble@@ t or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ ph@@ et , and thus lose performance .
so the ri@@ vals will pay even more , and in the future the boys will be even worse .
moreover , the pain will not remain in the bodies of the former for too long .
if you take a pain@@ kil@@ ler in the morning , you are doing it with an empty th@@ read - it irri@@ ta@@ tes you with an already ra@@ va@@ ged machine .
or if a partner is not taken with it , then it can get through itself well .
it is about the same thing as wal@@ king , but there is no room for compla@@ c@@ ency in wal@@ king .
however , too active a speed and ex@@ or@@ bit@@ ant shops were avoided - the physical effort should be moderate at the time of the po@@ t .
a jo@@ ke .
there is a sil@@ ly talk , easy fu@@ n and na@@ il @-@ friendly talk with the friends of time and with others ( suffering ) .
a Naz@@ is and a woman may not be driven away , but they certainly make it easier to tolerate after the phenomenon .
once upon a time , the po@@ cket is going through anyway !
a worker at the University of North@@ w@@ ester and Ox@@ ford is being sought as suspects in murder
according to the police , an employee at the University of North@@ w@@ ester@@ n and at the University of Ox@@ ford is being sought nation@@ wide and has become suspects after deadly March w@@ ounds of rub@@ b@@ ish finding the bodies of a male people in a luxury cor@@ ps in Ch@@ ic@@ ago .
according to the C@@ oo@@ k Coun@@ ty &apos;s documents , an arrest warrant was issued on Monday without any bail @-@ out for the arrest of a 42 @-@ year @-@ old W@@ yn@@ d@@ ha@@ m La@@ them@@ i and a 56 @-@ year @-@ old Andrew War@@ ren@@ i , accused of being murdered by their alleged involvement in the first instance , T@@ ren@@ ton H. James Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ u .
according to the documents , a 26 @-@ year @-@ old Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ u died after repeated marriages .
according to the warning issued by the police station in Ch@@ ic@@ ago to the community , the body was discovered to be dead on 27 July .
the police received a telephone call call and found a victim on arrival in the Grand Pla@@ za Kor@@ ter@@ house with several stor@@ my plans on his body .
according to officials , Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ u was recognised to be dead and investi@@ g@@ ators regard am@@ bus@@ h as murder , while the police actively seek two suspects .
Ms La@@ them has been working as co @-@ professor of micro@@ bi@@ ology and immun@@ ology since 2007 at the University of North@@ w@@ ester .
in a statement sent by Vice @-@ President Ala@@ n K@@ . C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge , Vice @-@ President for Public Relations of the University , La@@ them has now been temporarily removed from work and banned from entering the cities of the University of North@@ w@@ ester .
&quot; this is now a criminal act being investigated by the competent authorities , and the North@@ w@@ ester University is working with the investi@@ g@@ ators , &quot; said C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge .
W@@ ret@@ n is a senior assis@@ tant at the University of Ox@@ ford .
in a statement sent as an email to the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College , &quot; we have been in contact with the British police and ready to help the US investigation authorities in every possible way . &quot;
in addition , the statement stated that my colleagues at War@@ ren@@ i were shocked and willing to present themselves .
An@@ th@@ ony G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , head of the communication department in Ch@@ ic@@ ago &apos;s police department , is urging suspects to be handed over to the authorities on suspicion .
&quot; the police have an idea where they are , but we are working on the exact location increasingly intensively , &quot; said G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m says that the local , regional and national authorities are helping to search for suspects .
G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m said that the police got a telephone call from the Grand Pla@@ za House administra@@ tor , who had just received ch@@ ry@@ p@@ tic rain that something had happened in a@@ partment 10@@ 08 .
according to the police descri@@ ptions , this was a vi@@ vid view .
according to G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , it is not clear whether the event itself took place on 27 July .
he said that the safety camer@@ as confirmed the presence of La@@ them@@ i and War@@ ren@@ i in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor La@@ th@@ a@@ mal and the victim had a relationship , &quot; added G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
the Grand Pla@@ za leadership sent a letter to the population : &apos; the police are currently working to find out about the or@@ ch@@ ron@@ ology of events and the background to the victim , and are looking at different mo@@ tives , including the possibility of a family dispute &apos; .
firms that help your company avoid becoming the next U@@ b@@ by
A@@ my Er@@ re@@ tt wanted to measure workers &apos; satisfaction in his e @-@ commerce start @-@ ups , but the polls were fu@@ tile .
the answers were often vague , useless or , worse still , misleading .
and even if he promised to ensure anon@@ y@@ mity , some workers did not trust this process .
&apos;@@ The system was simply not consistent and objective &apos; said Er@@ re@@ tt , who runs an e @-@ commerce company , Mad@@ ison Re@@ ed , which sel@@ ls Jewish care products in San Franc@@ is@@ co with 75 employees .
he has therefore called on external actors to help .
start @-@ ups dealing with new types of human resources are emerging , helping companies to find out what their workers feel .
by developing and licen@@ sing software aimed at measuring the involvement of workers , they allow companies to make app surveys , to target specific teams and demographic groups , to offer anon@@ y@@ mity and a hot line of complaints to workers , and in some cases to allow them to by@@ pass C @-@ level managers and to address the G@@ over@@ ning Board directly .
&quot; there are now tools such as Stra@@ va and F@@ it@@ bi for health monitoring , but where is F@@ it@@ bi for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ net@@ t , co @-@ foun@@ der and CE@@ O Reding City start @-@ ups G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytical tool is used by companies to measure worker involvement .
he has got a much better picture of what his staff think and feel over the three years he has used in G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to opinion polls aimed at intr@@ usive studies and certain teams , it provides a company &apos;s thermal card , which gives an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest level of support , enabling them to identify the causes .
companies have started to realise that they need to stay informed about their working culture in order not to change to the next U@@ b , which has been revol@@ ted in scandals since the former employee published blo@@ gg@@ ers describing a har@@ as@@ sing environment in which those who da@@ red to speak were punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , the desire to have an overview is a lu@@ cra@@ tive business opportunity .
the global area of governance , regulation and compliance may be worth more than USD 118@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the website of financial statistics , L@@ et &apos;s talk @-@ about payments .
this year , against the background of the dubious reputation of U@@ ber , a start @-@ up company operating in Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o , which helps businesses to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour , observed an increase in interest and activity .
the Code has almost 600 customers , including Airbus , Microsoft and T@@ es@@ la .
U@@ ber recently registered himself as a customer .
like G@@ lin@@ ki , the convergence cent allows companies to send adapted impul@@ ses , collect real @-@ time confidential responses and look at problem areas of heat cards .
it also provides an anon@@ ymous model of message that enables workers to report inappropriate behaviour .
and when it comes to the executive director , complaints go directly to the Bureau .
&quot; public opinion has been delivered by regulators , &quot; said Customs cen@@ ti foun@@ der and CE@@ O Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan .
I am going to say that if a company finds that it mis@@ treated its workers or beha@@ ves une@@ th@@ ically , it could face serious consequences , such as consumer boycot@@ ts , the withdrawal of workers and court cases , even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene .
heading T , a restaur@@ ant with more than 25 000 employees at 500 sites , has used the convergence cen@@ sus for more than a year to ensure workers &apos; awareness of the rules and procedures and to provide an easy way to communicate with the Corpor@@ ate headquarters .
when a worker wanted to report a problem earlier , he had to find a telephone number or email address at the corpor@@ ation headquarters , make a formal appeal and hope that it would be taken seriously .
this was often a da@@ un@@ ting and un@@ comfortable process , said Ru@@ by Prime Coun@@ sell@@ or James Vit@@ ran@@ o , who said that there was no good way to monitor workers &apos; complaints .
however , now that the company is operating on convergence cen@@ ti , problems such as discrimination , harassment or unfair pay practices , which did not previously lead to managers operating in offices located in other cities or states , can be identified and dealt with more quickly .
&quot; I can get closer to the holistic 3@@ 60 degree experience of the workers , &quot; said Vit@@ ran@@ o , who chairs the Ru@@ by telecommunications risk management group .
&quot; and we will protect our shareholders from legal disputes with workers . &quot;
I was saying that companies started to take ethical behaviour , values and workers &apos; involvement much more seriously in 2002 , after an audit@@ or , Ar@@ th@@ ur Andersson , collapsed due to ethical irregularities in relation to the En@@ r@@ on scandal .
however , only when &apos; social media became mature &apos; did companies realise that they could not prevent their black was@@ hing from being publicly beaten online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both the city and the convergence cent offer their software as a service , taking a perio@@ dic fee from companies for using their products .
it is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors , who have supported both start @-@ ups .
the convergence was funded in February by companies such as S@@ ap@@ ph@@ ire Ven@@ tures and the then Capital , thereby increasing the capital collected to USD 47 million .
in November , the G@@ lin@@ ti invested USD 10 million in B@@ es@@ se@@ mer Ven@@ ture partners , increasing the company &apos;s total funding to USD 60 million .
such investments will come as no surprise , given the inter@@ conne@@ c@@ tedness of companies , culture and venture capital .
more and more studies show that today &apos;s workers expect more from the workplace than they have done in the past .
in competitive markets such as S@@ ili@@ c@@ on Val@@ ley , high wages and interesting projects are merely contributions on the table .
the workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they are de@@ voting their time to a company with a positive mission .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen people are happy at the company , they feel they are listened to and more satisfied with the work they do , &apos; said N@@ ina Mc@@ Qu@@ e@@ en , Vice @-@ President of the Department for General benefit and Workers &apos; Survey , L@@ in@@ ke@@ d@@ In@@ is , which uses both convergence cen@@ ti and G@@ lin@@ ti .
investors will earn money if companies in their portfolio do well ; companies will do well if workers are committed and involved .
if third party analytical tools allow for an increase in the commitment and involvement of workers , then it is no wonder that they will receive support .
having data on worker involvement is important , according to professionals .
however , this data will be useless if it is not followed up by company supervisors .
in fact , when a company asks for feedback from its employees , it may raise expectations that change is ahead of us .
and if change is not made quickly enough or not at all , it may cause disappointment and reduce workers &apos; involvement .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen you ask for 4 000 proposals , you have to be prepared for 4 000 conver@@ sa@@ tions , &apos; said the President of the Con@@ sul@@ tative and Business Administration , K@@ ot@@ ter International , R@@ us@@ sell Ra@@ ath , who has seen companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection .
&quot; because if things do not finish , the workers will think : &apos; did you actually listen to me ?
do you care ?
and if you do not care , why should I care ? &apos;
according to an Er@@ ret@@ ti , the Mad@@ ison Re@@ e@@ l , which is now carrying out six studies among workers , has been able to take action on the same day that the problem has been reported through G@@ lin@@ t .
and , having received feedback from workers disappointed with the speed and quality of the decision @-@ making process , he was able to re@@ organise a number of cre@@ ws in the company and offer communication training to tackle the problems .
however , Ru@@ by interoperability will collect new data on workers and it is hoped that , in the long term , this will lead to a longer @-@ term commitment from industry , known for its high turnover .
&apos;@@ I@@ f you are not committed to transparency , you lose people &apos; said Vit@@ ran@@ o .
&apos;@@ I@@ f you lose people , you lose customers .
and if you lose your customers , you lose companies &apos; .
Baltic States : fast @-@ growing incomes
although the 2008 crisis and trade concerns with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic , the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the income of the rich countries of Western Europe , B@@ om@@ berg is writing with reference to the European Central Bank report .
according to the Central Bank , since 1999 , total economic output per capita in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations .
this success is due to low indeb@@ tedness , fast @-@ moving institutions and business @-@ friendly and non @-@ market @-@ friendly policies .
&quot; the Baltic States , together with Slovakia , are among the few countries in the euro area where reactor GDP per capita has moved significantly from shopping to EU average . &quot;
although the objective is for the total economic output per capita to be equ@@ alised to a richer Western Europe , in 2015 the total output of the Baltic economies per capita amounted to only 2 / 3 of the national average for the 15 countries that were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round .
low wages have led the Bal@@ tics to seek better wages abroad .
although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic countries in a positive light and the economy is growing this year , the local people are not enthusiastic at all .
according to the latest Eurobarometer survey , only a quarter of people in Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies were doing very well or rather well .
in the Czech Republic and Poland , just under half of those surve@@ yed thought this about their national economies .
N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s decision to cancel trends twice a day makes Bru@@ in@@ si long
it is almost 23 o &apos;@@ clock when football clubs at the U@@ C@@ L@@ A League are stopped for discussion at the end of a new exercise in the university town of a team .
some of them have burdened their businesses with the effort made on the first day of their training camp .
for a large part of the team , these Christmas minutes offer a break from mid@@ day to mid@@ day .
players taking part in the course of the course will return , after a three @-@ hour trend , to studying the co@@ habi@@ tation for final exa@@ min@@ ations before returning for next morning &apos;s 6.@@ 30 meetings at the W@@ S@@ F football es@@ cor@@ t .
&apos;@@ The next three days will be a real challenge for them , &apos; said Jim Mor@@ a , the Bru@@ in@@ si train@@ er , shortly before Monday became Tuesday .
the N@@ CA@@ A decision to cancel trends twice a day to reduce the burden of players has , in fact , over@@ stret@@ ched their days - at least until we get one half @-@ way through final exa@@ min@@ ations on Friday .
for this reason , the first three courses of U@@ C@@ L@@ A were ti@@ med to start at 19.@@ 15 in order to fit in with the already den@@ se schedule of players .
the transition from two to more days on a daily basis means more days on a tr@@ ong - the start of the Bru@@ in@@ si training camp has been increased almost a week ahead compared to the previous season and , for the first time , during the six W@@ es@@ tw@@ oo season , training sessions are taking place during summer courses .
they are planning until 20 August to 18 trends before formal preparations begin for the opening game in September against T@@ ex@@ as A &amp; M .
according to Mor@@ a , he is in favour of a change of the N@@ CA@@ A rules , although it adds another item to the players &apos; tight schedu@@ les .
&quot; they have a huge burden on three or four days and that is a serious challenge , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; and they are going through this challenge ; they are struggling , they are wonderful young people .
I believe that when it comes to Saturday and we have more time , it will be a real pleasure . &quot;
once the camp is over , U@@ C@@ L@@ A training will be closed down , which is no easy task , however , given the clear view of their remote par@@ king pla@@ te and remo@@ tely located at the centre of L@@ us@@ kin@@ i , a high @-@ class hotel , which has already arrived at a ga@@ te@@ way through a protective network surrounding the ga@@ te@@ way .
since this weekend , ho@@ tels are occupied by players in Bru@@ in@@ si , but Mor@@ a acknowledged that problems could arise during the season with free tobacco .
&apos;@@ L@@ et us take security measures , &apos; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; this is a real cause for concern and it is no exagg@@ erated to think that people can rent a mo@@ use and fil@@ ter from there .
if you have a record of a training , you can do quite a good deal .
but we use the security team there and at the 8@@ th par@@ king station .
we will do our best to use what we have .
I will try not to worry very much about this .
we have a plan in place . &quot;
the Sa@@ sta@@ are @-@ I@@ van@@ o@@ va electoral union born of the Central Party , the dis@@ en@@ fran@@ ch@@ ise@@ ment of Kris@@ ti@@ ina O@@ range , who was expelled from the reform party , and forced to withdraw from the ECB for the bringing together of the forces of Maria Kal@@ j@@ ds , to our Tallinn and the parties , seems to be showing at least as much as the political parties involved in the local elections this year .
however , buses will be counted in the autumn , and the key question will be whether they will have sufficiently disappointed voters .
who will remain in Sa@@ sta@@ are@@ a ?
how small the support department of Ed@@ gar Sa@@ sta@@ are has decreased , one can foresee events organised to honour his electoral union .
one member of the National Assembly , some former and present parties and many unknown faces : will this be the composition of the electoral Union ?
and why , in Tallinn , some of the fai@@ th@@ ful supporters and friends of Sa@@ sta@@ are avoid standing in , can one ask that the &apos; Sa@@ sta@@ are list &apos; of the companies , led by corruption and suspected of corruption , is becoming a reality ?
a Russian @-@ speaking po@@ em involving the parent of the town &apos;s city &apos;s city &apos;s city &apos;s en@@ vy ; and , in all respects , a pri@@ mi@@ tive computer game in which Prime Minister J@@ ü@@ ri Ra@@ tas , while travelling on a ra@@ da@@ ir , must avoid stra@@ y and sla@@ ves - is this the Central Party the first attempt at the votes of 16 and 17 @-@ year @-@ old voters ad@@ mitting ballot bo@@ xes ?
we look forward to seeing what other parties &apos; perception of the youth campaign is .
there are two options to accept that only ET@@ V , ET@@ V@@ 2 , ET@@ V + , Tallinn TV and English @-@ language Fran@@ ce@@ 24 channels will henceforth be viewed as opposed to enter@@ tainment from the beginning of August : to accept that , in future , only 10 television operators will see the wh@@ eel@@ 2 , the ET@@ V@@ 2 , the T@@ V@@ 3 + , the Tallinn TV and the English @-@ language Fran@@ ce@@ 24 channels or will be sur@@ rendered every month .
there are probably also those who initially openly re@@ jo@@ ice in the free television experience of advertising , but in the end , though reluc@@ tantly , pay for television sets and advertise@@ ments .
In@@ de@@ af@@ ening music , la@@ den nation and rub@@ b@@ ish left on the streets are almost an un@@ pleasant side of every major music affair .

media publications quote President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i , who said that there is a new US immigration plan which will change the rules of the Green Card .
the plan foresees a reduction in the number of legal immigrants for 50 000 people per year , stricter rules on obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visas .
the new rules have been proposed by the Re@@ publi@@ can people and supported by the President .
the draft law will be discussed in two cha@@ mbers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars &apos; taxpayers &apos; money because it will change the way the US hand@@ les green cards to citizens of other countries .
the law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme .
the new application process will give priority to candidates who speak English and have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills to benefit our economy , &quot; said T@@ ru@@ mp , the US media ou@@ tle@@ ts .
Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ to young people are moving to the city , to pensioners , back to the land .
A@@ na@@ tol@@ y of J@@ ev@@ se@@ ye@@ v continues the tradition of famous se@@ to gold min@@ ers along the Ma@@ ana River in the past .
she works 140 kilometres away from her home , at the Ma@@ ana supplementary war at Ku@@ vai , as a head of the gold @-@ screen on the car .
it is a tough job : two months of work for 12 hours without rest days , and then only 10 days at home and again back home .
for three years , A@@ na@@ tol@@ y has only once seen its cul@@ mination in the order of business .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at is a th@@ or@@ ny regime there : when you go into it , you do not get the gra@@ de , and when you go on to not take it with you &apos; , A@@ na@@ tol@@ y speaks .
M@@ are Pi@@ ho is speaking in the village of H@@ ai@@ da to a local se@@ to Ja@@ an , who has spoken to him a great deal about the memor@@ ies of his family in Si@@ beria .
the archa@@ ic culture that remains in Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ tos will also affect home @-@ se@@ als , as it is simply so dramatic that it will think most deeply about the distant se@@ als investigated by Pi@@ ho M@@ are .
his first trip to Si@@ beria will be 30 years later this year .
during that time , he has been there 14 times and lived there for one year .
how many went out to Si@@ beria at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century to get land here ?
this is an unresolved issue .
I would argue that 8 000 .
I took this out of the story of the men in Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ to , who have thought about it themselves .
it is precisely difficult to say , because up to 30 people may have come to one group at the time , but the passport was given to a man only .
only one passport was issued , but had children , sis@@ ters and others .
look at how large that territory was here !
it was several times greater than historical S@@ et@@ ko .
after all , it needed to be educated , managed in some way .
S@@ et@@ ry came here as pe@@ as@@ ants , but their lives changed , because here they got into areas that were not just linked to agriculture , but also to the river ( pal@@ e @-@ par@@ king ) , gold mines , industry .
for example , in New Pet@@ ser@@ is , many se@@ als later went to work in a classified city of K@@ ras@@ no@@ j@@ sk @-@ 45 ( where the Soviet authorities built a uranium enrichment plant - J. P@@ . ) when it was formed .
did the se@@ men form the majority of the population in this region at the time ?
yes , they were living in a Compact .
in addition , the tradition of marriage and multic@@ ul@@ tur@@ alism maintained a long time ago .
seven to eight children in the family were common .
how much of the Si@@ b@@ erian comp@@ ound culture differs and differs from that of the mother country ?
they are different , although what was brought here was once the same .
they brought a great many ideas to the people .
they also did so themselves ( ideas of the people ) at the time , but they always made a distinction between what had been brought about and what had been done here .
climate change has had a severe impact on the traditional clo@@ thes of se@@ als , because it is col@@ der here .
the proposed changes were made .
for example , S@@ et@@ oma@@ al had a salt pla@@ te , but it was simply frozen here .
where are the Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ room villages and what life will live there ? / graph@@ ics : A@@ lar@@ i Pal@@ u@@ ends ?
the link with the mother country was spiri@@ tually strong , it was considered very important .
it seems to me that this country is now going to give back there , will influence them .
the girls who have lived in families have listened to ama@@ zing stories .
Pi@@ ho is thinking of people from the Estonian se@@ room delegation who came to H@@ ai@@ da Bay Day at the beginning of July and lived in homes - J. P - for four days .
what is still here is shocking .
&apos;@@ It is extremely easy to come and get off the ground , because the city has a great location : railway be@@ er and road crossing the border &apos; , says T@@ ap@@ s &apos;s oper@@ is@@ ol@@ ist Re@@ ig@@ o Tampere .
the city is no longer just a military capital ; we have a lot of nature , sport and culture , and the car@@ rot gets everywhere .
T@@ ap@@ a is a ti@@ p @-@ fleet !
there are small islands on which to keep al@@ p@@ ine po@@ p@@ pi@@ es common to be held from the town through the current white river .
&apos;@@ There is no room for this beautiful train window , &apos; Re@@ ig@@ o is mu@@ d@@ dled .
those who are not afraid of cold water can flood into the river because the river is full of sources .
I have been there , I can do it !
the river &apos;s water can keep the length and simply make the ro@@ man@@ tics - one can look at the flow of the river and think ahead and think about life .
I , too , have been there with my bri@@ de .
apart from anything else , Tampere has been on the river stret@@ ch between the three bridges : &apos; as this place is next to the city , no one may even be able to stand up if their stories are told &apos; .
&quot; a wonderful view of T@@ ap@@ a is emerging from the toy hill , but there are also health professionals where you can run , you can ski@@ e the winter and now , for example , you can play a dis@@ c@@ gol@@ f &apos;s game : the gol@@ f path has been taken , the super@@ market can lend from the sports centre , &quot; Re@@ ig@@ o pre@@ sides .
the old pro@@ tag@@ onists , of course , go there with their own spring , but I have not yet got there .
obviously my colleague , Ras@@ mus Gol@@ l , must be invited to visit T@@ ap@@ ale , because he has experienced a dis@@ cer@@ n@@ ment of a dis@@ cer@@ n@@ ment and he has a he@@ re@@ tics .
perhaps he will lend me !
Re@@ ig@@ o and M@@ än@@ ni@@ ku@@ p were in@@ separ@@ able from the current period of their oper@@ a @-@ purely childhood .
at least during the ski@@ ing hours .
there are many te@@ ars , many frustra@@ tions and you can go on to this memory in my sporting life .
not to mention broken ban@@ kno@@ tes and ban@@ ners .
&quot; the city as a whole is now full of construction works , all this is changing to a sen@@ se@@ less &apos; , Re@@ ig@@ o pra@@ ises .
however , an old and ti@@ red bo@@ y building is a very attractive place where oral disco@@ veries are played .
I am pleased that , in 2012 , the leader of R@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ M adopted my idea in Me@@ os and had to make a permanent summer theat@@ re with his theat@@ re .
although this year &apos;s theat@@ re season &apos; Ale@@ ey@@ i K@@ aren@@ in &apos; has just come to an end , on 11 August , the railway station is &apos; El@@ lu@@ d@@ ding &apos; , when the old stock is moving around the 1980s .
&quot; between 11 and 13 August , T@@ ap@@ a will be the city of T@@ ap@@ a &apos;s Day , which has been following a series of open house t@@ issues and a series of cultural events including a crow@@ d of people , &quot; speaking in Re@@ ig@@ o , who is just calling for a visit to the city from 9 to 11 years .
in a poor three @-@ chamber on the bot@@ tle of 1 May , the muse@@ um has already been on the way since 1994 .
&apos;@@ The house is small , but the ex@@ hi@@ b@@ itors are a great deal of information and vast amount of information &apos; , pra@@ ises Re@@ ig@@ o &apos;s place , full of the history of the city of T@@ ap@@ a , most of which focuses on rail and military activity .
Re@@ ig@@ o mu@@ d@@ ens that , if T@@ ap@@ al goes through all the recommended sites , the st@@ oma@@ ch will be empty , but fortunately the small city will be full of ca@@ f@@ és .
&apos;@@ We have such good di@@ ets and sometimes get the feeling that you are abroad when you sit in ca@@ f@@ és &apos; , he describes .
well @-@ educated and young soldiers who come to T@@ ap@@ a spend a lot of time in pu@@ b ca@@ f@@ és , and the se@@ ams are striking there with the feeling that you are in Estonia and in your home town , but the round is a multinational company of this kind .
I believe it would be very exciting to listen to stories from the French or American side .

in Greece , two Bulg@@ arians were arrested for illegal ten@@ dering
television channel b@@ TV quoted a foreign Ministry who reported that two Bulg@@ arians were arrested in Greece for having ordered illegally .
on the morning of 1 August , a group of illegally ordered persons were arrested by the police on the island of Si@@ th@@ onia , including two Bulg@@ arians .
they were released on the same day , but an investigation is currently taking place .
the Foreign Ministry said to the television channel that Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free ten@@ dering and are already imposing heavy penalties on anyone who is caught in a holiday place that is not intended to do so .
checks will continue throughout the season .
according to the Ministry , the court may impose a fine .
the w@@ ol@@ ves that teach the ar@@ m@@ ire are breaking the sheep .
the farmers on the shel@@ f have to give their &apos; educational material &apos; to the w@@ ol@@ ves again after a year - the w@@ ol@@ ves that have obviously taught spa@@ w@@ ns have already broken up a lot of sheep .
this year , the w@@ ol@@ ves in the coun@@ ty of Hi@@ i@@ u have broken sheep three times , 23 sheep in total , and eight have been injured , writing the Hi@@ i@@ u site .
the soil had only three figures , 124 years earlier .
in syn@@ dro@@ me , there are also data from the Environment Agency that w@@ ol@@ f was@@ hing machines were not born on last year &apos;s Hi@@ pe land and that information from the Hi@@ pe Council on the fixing of two w@@ ol@@ f was@@ hing machines on the island this year .
against the Ecolabel on Monday , the w@@ ol@@ ves unle@@ as@@ hed 15 sheep in the village of K@@ abu@@ ana and injured 18 survi@@ v@@ ors .
in the early morning of Wednesday &apos;s morning , the w@@ ol@@ f broke one lam@@ b on the Coun@@ ty of the Re@@ he@@ lin village and severely injured another , who had to be subjected to an emergency killing .
the rules on the management of genetically modified crops must be clear
the Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a coordination round the Law on the release of GMOs into the environment ( GMOs V@@ S ) and a draft law amending the plant protection law .
the amendment of the law remo@@ ves the creation of a separate collection of data both for GM ( GM ) crops and for operators , using a future plant health register .
in addition , the GM crop operator is changing the obligation to have prior agreement on the radio to ap@@ ic@@ ulture @-@ handling person .
although GM crops are currently not grown in Estonia , we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of GM and non @-@ GM crops .
this is at least as long as it has not been decided to declare a GMO @-@ free in Estonia , &quot; S@@ ig@@ mar Suu Kyi , head of the plant health department at the Department of Rural Affairs , said .
&quot; at the same time , we need to take into account that the measures we have developed need to be targeted and proportionate , taking into account the costs and administrative burden for both the private and public sectors . &quot;
the draft act repe@@ als the provisions relating to the collection and training of GM crop locations and operators in V@@ S , lays down requirements for the management of GM crops and the opening up of economic activities .
in particular , with regard to beekeeping , the GM crop farmer &apos;s current obligation to inform bee@@ keepers about the cultivation of GM crops with the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with ap@@ ic@@ ulture before cultivation begins .
the draft law has been sent for coordination with minis@@ tries .
all interested parties will have the opportunity to examine this in the information system and , if they so wish , present their views to the World Department .
the proposed changes will affect , in particular , those in the plant farming sector , bee@@ keepers and the Agriculture Agency .
only one GM crop - mon 8@@ 10 - can be grown in the European Union , including Estonia .
to date , however , no Estonian farmer has taken an interest in growing GM crops .
the reason for this is that Estonia does not have a Ma@@ in ch@@ arity , a European cor@@ n for which the maize line mon 8@@ 10 is resistant .
the articles on this land@@ line have also been closed to the southern regions , and this is inappropriate for our climate conditions in May .
in 2015 and 2016 , the Department of Rural Affairs commissioned studies to detect contamination of potentially GM organisms in seeds for various types of f@@ at@@ tening , maize and soya grown in Estonia .
the analysis of the tests carried out showed that seeds were not present and that the study concluded that the seeds of increased rape , maize and soya in Estonia did not contain GMOs .
the previous one , in turn , suggests that there is no deliberate cultivation of GM crops in Estonia and no random contamination either .

E@@ pon@@ der of the White House cost taxpayers thousands
according to military documents published during the magaz@@ ine , the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicop@@ ter last month for an attempt to celebrate American production has cost the southern taxpayer as much as USD 24 000 .
the green and white colour , S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D , called Marine One under the presidency &apos;s presidency in office , was the central figure for an event presenting the American construction programmes in White City on 17 July .
President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp , senior officials of Vice @-@ President M@@ ike P@@ ence and the White House announced industrial products during their t@@ our of all 50 states .
the helicop@@ ter set up in Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ u@@ tis was ex@@ hi@@ jac@@ ked together with a hun@@ t from repu@@ te , a W@@ is@@ con@@ ist fire @-@ fighting car and a two @-@ stro@@ ke from Mis@@ sis@@ ter .
according to the documents of the es@@ ka@@ r Marine H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter S@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ on One ( H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 ) , who is responsible for operating the H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter , the White House &apos;s military office called for the presence of a helicop@@ ter &apos;s office , known as the F@@ AR@@ G@@ O , barely s@@ tun@@ ning 36 hours before the helicop@@ ter bu@@ ried for an extraordinary event in the South .
&apos;@@ I wanted you to be aware of this , because it is an un@@ usually high @-@ profile event , &apos; said H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 com@@ man@@ der a day before the event in an e @-@ mail to his sup@@ eri@@ ority , the Deputy officer of the na@@ vy in the field of aviation .
the message stated that the helicop@@ ter would arrive in the southern hor@@ ror at around 7 p.m. on the morning of 17 July and stay there until the Christmas night between 18 and 21 is cleared .
what was added was the fact that , should there be a departure from the White House , a second @-@ hul@@ l is needed for a return flight due to the restrictions on working time .
the original flight team was at the helicop@@ ter during the event , and the security team sta@@ yed near the aircraft for all the time it was on the ground .
it was not possible to find out from the documents that were submitted to the magaz@@ ine whether or not it was ultimately necessary to have another b@@ rick boat .
H@@ at@@ ch &apos;s law prohibits federal workers from using government property for political purposes .
the documents show that H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 examined whether this event could breach this provision .
&quot; we asked whether it was in breach of H@@ at@@ ch &apos;s law and we were told that it would not violate , &apos; wrote com@@ man@@ der .
&apos;@@ It seems that you have no choice , &apos; responded to the Deputy senior officer .
the White House declared the &apos; American made in &apos; event to be an official event , and the H@@ at@@ ch law would not have covered it .
but even the official events have political under@@ ton@@ es .
the President backed the efforts of the Health Reform under discussion at that time in the Senate and praised efforts to keep government regulations in check .
the use of aircraft known as Marine One or Air Task Force for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon .
Presidents must use them to travel .
however , the requirement to use them purely as a photo@@ graph is unusual .
in February , a T@@ ru@@ mp came to the attention of a President &apos;s plane at his first campaign event , Flor@@ ida@@ ges Mel@@ bour@@ ne , and he dis@@ plays Twitter &apos;s account of messages complaining about the way in which his predecessor used the plane .
&quot; white Ma@@ k is very pleased with the display &quot; made in America , &quot; where products from all 50 states produced by American workers were represented , &quot; said L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters , spokes@@ man of the White House .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 teams often carry out test flights around Washington and in the south in order to get used to wa@@ ving down the United States President &apos;s White House with a single @-@ me@@ tre accuracy .
when T@@ ru@@ mp was in Germany at the start of July at the G20 Summit , H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 w@@ aged 58 tests lan@@ ded in the H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 White House season .
according to the official , the flight &apos; American &apos; flight crew was included as the standard for the monthly study flights to the &apos; American &apos; event .
Monday &apos;s helicop@@ ters flying for 11 hours on that day on top of the &apos; non @-@ presidential support missions &apos; .
according to the White House , none of the other ex@@ hi@@ b@@ itors of the event were burden on taxpayers &apos; pur@@ ses .
according to the representative of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky , the company was not involved in carrying out ex@@ ci@@ tement at the southern hor@@ ror of the helicop@@ ter .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 will not maintain the budgetary documents for the President &apos;s flights and the precise costs of the event will be difficult to identify .
but at the Ministry of Defence &apos;s prices for the financial year 2017 , the V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D reimbursement rate is USD 24 380 per hour per flight .
the Es@@ ka@@ r documents indicated that the flight would take longer than 30 minutes from Qu@@ an@@ tic@@ o Air@@ port to Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , its main base .
the White House claims that the real cost of using the helicop@@ ter is well below its sum .
&quot; calculating taxpayers &apos; costs on the basis of estimated compensation rates is very misleading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at &apos;s estimated compensation rates include many other irreversible costs for staff , maintenance and expenditure which will be taken into account for annual appropriations &apos; .
according to the rand survey of 2015 , compensation rates at the Ministry of Defence do not include personnel costs , but they cover fuel , maintenance and contract costs .
the former spokes@@ person of the White House , Se@@ an S@@ pic@@ er , defended the use of helicop@@ ter at the time at the event .
&quot; the point is to show things made in America this week , &quot; said S@@ pic@@ er .
&quot; and I know that the State of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ u@@ ti is very proud to contribute to our national security and that there are expected to be hundreds , if not thousands , of people whose work depends on it .
and I believe that just like most Americans , we are all proud of this helicop@@ ter and other military equipment , which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rele@@ ssly on .
so of course it is right to highlight this . &quot;
it is not clear whether or not the T@@ ru@@ mp had to deal with the helicop@@ ter when it was circu@@ lating in the southern hor@@ ror , but he was lying behind the fire @-@ fighting car .
in the White House , T@@ ru@@ mp S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky addressed representatives , throwing out the media car@@ ic@@ a@@ tures of a company &apos;s products on its own aircraft fleet .
&apos;@@ I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ ská very well , &apos; said the President , &apos; I have three of their products &apos; .
G@@ ri Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o - B@@ y te@@ ars , peace and joy arrived
M@@ il D@@ ae@@ gh in 2011 hit Š@@ ade@@ i@@ ko@@ t in the last area , 800 m of be@@ ver@@ ages ran a sta@@ di@@ um , and was taken away from the sta@@ di@@ um with a camer@@ a .
just before that , he had received a zero degree of distance from his uni@@ versi@@ tu@@ alist in China .
in 2012 , Helsinki was the victim of a cheap injury , but in London , he received 60@@ 13 points 23 from the debate .
however , the mis@@ fortune continued .
following the opening day of 2013 , the Moscow M@@ oma received a remote F@@ lash injury from an Estonian record .
two years later , he held 15 seats in Beijing &apos;s M@@ il and held the Olympic or@@ ch@@ es@@ tra , but that , too , had wanted more frustration on the part of the ath@@ le@@ te .
only last night , Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o did not receive a letter of result initially from the Amsterdam EM@@ W .
I would just like to put together , once or for once , one proper multi @-@ contest .
once &apos; , Sh@@ ade@@ ik@@ o spra@@ yed &apos; .
worse still to come : a month later , his Olympic competition in Ri@@ os broke the first hur@@ dle because of re@@ ig@@ ning .
the time had to be taken out - to carry on with the seven competitions at all ?
is the effort of two days worth all of this ?
N@@ ei@@ u thought for a long time , but found peace .
I was able to think clean on my head .
it is quite difficult to describe this experience , but I have won@@ dered that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen .
fortunately , there was time to cure ourselves healthy and think twice .
&quot; I knew I would not put a ba@@ g on my des@@ k yet , &quot; said Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o about his self @-@ cle@@ ans@@ ing .
I was able to turn a page and move forward with a new momentum .
T@@ re@@ en@@ er Anne mä@@ ki said that it was very difficult to look at the suffering of the care@@ less , but she realised that the ath@@ le@@ te itself , above all , had to find its own clarity .
after all , he was so wh@@ is@@ tle@@ blow@@ ed down by everyone .
it was difficult to tolerate .
&apos;@@ The G@@ ál said , however , that he will not give up and he wants to prove himself what he is worth &apos; says a mountain .
now there is some sort of peace in it .
he is doing so to his joy .
the contest came back in May when Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o set 6@@ 280 points in a new Estonian record in a series of competitions between G@@ son@@ z@@ is .
in a high @-@ level contest , he improved his personal high @-@ level heat requirement by almost a me@@ tre ( 13.@@ 89 ) and ran at a record near @-@ time barrier .
then , a multi @-@ competi@@ tor felt that it was not at all possible , but that only the initial hunger had been eradi@@ cated .
a mountain who guided him for years says that Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o is a black pu@@ pi@@ l .
he is a spor@@ ts@@ man , he is a good teacher .
if something is wrong or wrong , he says so now .
he knows his own body and entr@@ us@@ ts his own sense .
that is what we have to do .
I cannot say exactly what to do and follow it up .
Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o has also found a new approach .
&apos;@@ I am not the one who makes the maximum of the trend &apos; , he talks and says that the most important thing is to get the feeling right , because it also ensures a good result .
baby baby bo@@ om@@ ers are happy
the good emo@@ tion has also been offered the good luck of the people who are close .
both his former training fellow Member , Mar@@ is mä@@ ki , and sis@@ ter de Gre@@ te , have recently become parents and have received support from new weather citizens .
&apos;@@ It has been quite interesting &apos; , says Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o .
one alcohol whose drinking equ@@ ates to the brain &apos; training &apos; .
Li@@ ves@@ tr@@ ong wri@@ tes that Dr Gordon She@@ per@@ d is even such a big wine f@@ ans that he believes that wine can train better than any other tra@@ ine@@ e in the world .
She@@ per@@ d is a neuro@@ scien@@ tist at Y@@ ale University .
he says that this is not about alcohol or about how it affects our feelings and our ideas , but about the &apos; very active &apos; process of ta@@ pping wine .
by c@@ iting a glass , by sti@@ r@@ ring it up , enjoying it and dis@@ cer@@ ning a after@@ taste , we are putting our brain into work in order to create a taste for wine .
She@@ per@@ di said that the bo@@ vine images do not actually contain a taste , but that the taste arises from the way in which the wine stimu@@ lates the brain .
he makes a comparison between how the brain sees the colour .
&quot; taste is not wine , taste creates a taste for wine , &quot; says She@@ per@@ d .
the things that still affect the taste of wine are , for example , our age , our gender and even the amount of heart that man produces .
She@@ per@@ d , of course , is aware that wine is not so full of ha@@ ir .
&apos;@@ There must be more &apos; , he says .
if you take too much ban@@ g , the system has sa@@ tu@@ rated .
excessive drinking of wine can do harm instead of brain benefits - according to a 2004 study , people who drink more than three glass with wine , loss of memory , loss of balance and reduced mental capacity risk .

according to the UN , Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
the head of the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that the elections can only represent the people if all members of society , including women , play a role in them .
the leader of the United Nations Assistance Mission , Nic@@ ho@@ las Ha@@ y@@ so@@ m , said that hundreds of women would stand for election in local Soviet elections , three women stand as Vice @-@ President and more than 30 % of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; emphasising the importance of women &apos;s role cannot be exagg@@ erated , &quot; he said in a statement made on Wednesday .
the elections can truly represent the people and can only be credible if women are fully involved and involved in all stages of the electoral process .
elections and presidential elections in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April .
the Taliban , for their part , have threatened the electoral process , which coinci@@ des with a transition period in which the role of international military operations becomes consultative .
this year &apos;s elections mark the first time that power has been transferred cal@@ mly from one democratically elected government to the next .
according to the cl@@ one , a strong role for women increases the success of democracy in Afghanistan .
according to the In@@ dependent electoral Commission for Afghanistan , 1.2 million of the 3.@@ 6 million voters have registered with women .

T@@ ime@@ line bags are a summer class which , in recent years , has become a fa@@ it accomp@@ li product in itself and which has even had to be han@@ ged at the end of its hand by the right cli@@ ent , and which has been used by traders , regardless of its modest origin , to display an additional price label for h@@ iti@@ c .
the si@@ ck@@ ening ba@@ g is probably one of those things that has existed once in life and which has not been aro@@ used by much emo@@ tion .
it simply exists , and if it does not exist , there is nothing wrong with it .
now , however , the be@@ er bags are making a real race , and the sc@@ ans have swit@@ ched their fine de@@ sig@@ ner bags from simple be@@ er bags over the summer months .
that being the case , it is not only a coast@@ dog , but today it is just as popular as a street chamber and it even serves to walk into the office with b@@ older women .
however , it is worth making it clear here , before doing so , whether it is going to be a summer h@@ all or whether it is worth putting a mark and a lap@@ top computer on a little official summer .
however , the diversity of mediation has made the be@@ er com@@ mu@@ ters a genuine summer love of women .
for example , when reading foreign mo@@ il@@ logis@@ ts , the first thing to do is to note that the mo@@ e@@ o@@ gh@@ ur@@ ts are the first thing to do on holiday on the local market and acquire some be@@ er bags to which a whole holiday is then carried and which go along with be@@ aches , the market and also , as a friend , with a woman on the city &apos;s do@@ or@@ step .
some blo@@ gg@@ ers are even so generous that they buy a larger w@@ ol@@ f on the market and sell or give them away to their loyal read@@ ers .
it is worth noting , however , that there is such a high demand for bags among read@@ ers that women ( and men ! ) in the real world apparently go on to each other to become a happy owner for some homes .
in a sense , this mad@@ ness is also understandable , as rare times are when , in the fashion of yesterday , it is possible to buy something into a pu@@ zz@@ le for a few tens of euros .
it is true that ro@@ sy traders have also found easy money to make here , and so the more sophisticated luxury br@@ ands also sell their bags for a few hundred euros and a few thousand euros .
obviously , in order that richer customers do not have to feel like simple mortality , who try around with some cheap bags .
for example , it is possible to buy D@@ ol@@ ce &amp; Gab@@ ban@@ a &apos;s be@@ er over EUR 1 000 .
however , for the interpretation of Chan@@ el &apos;s translation , EUR 6 000 can be proposed in the circular .
however , unlike most of the mo@@ del@@ led buildings , the be@@ er do@@ es@@ n &apos;t inher@@ it at all from some of the great Cape Verde , but their story started far beyond .
indeed , the be@@ er bags are said to be very much from the Philippines , where they have been wor@@ n off .
F@@ igh@@ ting is primarily an export business there , and it is very often the case that local c@@ oo@@ king is taking place .
Ad@@ mittedly , the flou@@ ris@@ hing technique dates back to the 14@@ th century and is rather ri@@ fe with the usual bas@@ ket .
however , since the be@@ er does not have to be as red as cor@@ k , it is possible to have an in@@ habi@@ ted Muslim and other material that makes the co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il more person@@ alised and , by extension , more progressive .
recently , for example , tr@@ end@@ y bags , where pa@@ int stri@@ ps or s@@ kin@@ s have been c@@ oo@@ ked in , are particularly tr@@ end@@ y bags .
however , an ac@@ tress &apos;s J@@ ane Bir@@ kin@@ i can be sent in particular by be@@ er bags , the largest be@@ er fan of which had not been seen before .
indeed , he even suited the bre@@ wing to all sorts of clothing complex@@ es and did not have to go much with it to the Cannes Film F@@ esti@@ val .
however , the fact that they are popular today does not have a smaller role to play , but that caring for them is a bul@@ let and , unlike all other ski products , they do not have to be nur@@ tured by special means , but also by water and w@@ et di@@ r@@ ty .
as is always the case with tr@@ end@@ y rob@@ ber@@ y initiatives , apart from the classi@@ cal appearance , br@@ ands have come up with all manner of interpretations .
for example , if you want to , you can obtain a bun@@ ch of clo@@ thes from be@@ er be@@ er or a tiny lo@@ g of rub@@ ber .
it is worth remembering , however , that a classic be@@ er ba@@ g will never go from fashion to be@@ er flu .
but what is the classic be@@ er , then ?
for centuries , this kind of stra@@ w of be@@ er , re@@ minis@@ cent of its style , has been considered classi@@ cal and has been opened on the spot and has been short , as well as on be@@ er , pit@@ falls .

G@@ M@@ B is concerned about investments at the Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e plant in G@@ las@@ go@@ w
the trade union is expected from leaders of the mature producer Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e about long @-@ term production plans at the company &apos;s G@@ las@@ go@@ w plant .
according to G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ land , the company has kept quiet about the future of the investment in customs interoperability .
more than 500 people are employed in a theat@@ re producing H@@ ob@@ no@@ b@@ si and rich well @-@ known c@@ oo@@ kies and other products .
the owner of Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s company , Mr Pla@@ dis , said that he had invested more than GBP 5 million in the site over the last few years .
workers and trade union chair@@ men were paid there &apos; are the first to hear &apos; when something changes in the operation of the plant &apos; .
in a letter to the head of the company , G@@ M@@ B Scottish company Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e ap@@ pealed &apos; for concerns that funding would not be used to modernise production lines &apos; .
the G@@ M@@ B senior organis@@ er D@@ re@@ w Du@@ ff@@ y said : &apos; the fact that we are not getting clarity from the head of the object on the business needs of Customs and the future investment plan is a matter of deep concern to our members .
many generations of families have been employed here , and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and people around the G@@ las@@ go@@ w region , an essential pillar for ensuring proper employment in a region with high unemployment and social housing .
thus , in terms of jobs , wages and well @-@ being in the east of G@@ las@@ go@@ w , and in view of the increase in living costs and the chronic fall in production , a thri@@ ving Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e company is in dire need . &quot;
the planned representative said : &apos; the customs transfer site manager received a letter from G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ ter only yesterday and the company answers him directly because we value active contact with workers and trade union representatives .
two months ago , a regular meeting was held between workers and representatives of the G@@ M@@ B in Customs and openly discussed a number of issues .
we discussed with the workers at that time that , like all the other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we are reviewing our activities on the spot - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - in order to ensure that we are competitive .
he added : &apos; in recent years , we have invested more than GBP 5 million in the customs transfer site , most of which has gone into production lines and improvements to operations .
we fully understand Customs mark as an object of production and , should there be any change in its activities , workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it . &quot;
did the PS@@ G warn Barcelona three years ago about taking an approach to Ney@@ mari@@ i ?
la can regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tt
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not give up efforts to attract Ney@@ mar to his ranks by offering an amount of GBP 18@@ 9 million to buy him , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of this record seiz@@ ure trip ?
this th@@ or@@ ny approach has opened the summer &apos;s transition window , and the L@@ ig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break over the current world record of buying more than twice that set by Paul Po@@ g@@ ba &apos;s return to Manch@@ ester Uni@@ tes at the last season , for GBP 89 million .
once the transition has been completed , Ney@@ ra will become the most expensive player in the world , as well as the most highly paid professional ath@@ le@@ te in the world , who , after taxes , will be paid over GBP 500 000 a week .
Barcelona is , of course , ang@@ ry because of both the approach and the break @-@ up of Ney@@ mar@@ i , although the source close to Ca@@ tal@@ ans@@ i &apos;s board confirms that the club has always looked after the best since its arrival in San@@ to 2013 .
but did the PS@@ G President warn the world of the football world of such an opportunity three years ago ?
when Manch@@ ester City showed an interest in the conclusion of the Bla@@ ise Ma@@ tu@@ ed Agreement in 2014 , N@@ asse@@ r Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f strongly warned all clubs thinking about recru@@ iting some of the best PS@@ G players .
&apos;@@ I am not concerned because they know that when they concern some of our players , we stand up to them and make contact with their players , &apos; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but when they try to conclude an agreement with some of our players , they have to face the consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have gone beyond this limit , as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed an interest in the PS@@ G central player Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti .
the PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could suffer a set@@ back as a result of this interest by removing one of its precious assets in the form of Ney@@ mar@@ i .
Prime Minister : Ireland wants to build bridges , not borders , after Bre@@ x@@ iti@@ t .
&quot; Bre@@ x is seriously threatened with a w@@ edge between Northern Ireland and Ireland , Great Britain and Ireland , &quot; warned Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r on his first visit to Northern Ireland after he took office in June .
&quot; I cannot imagine who would benefit from it , &quot; he added .
cross @-@ border infrastructure projects made the current free movement of people and goods possible , said Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r .
&quot; this is our vision for the future : building bridges , not borders , &quot; he stressed .
he said earlier that he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union and , as it cannot , will remain part of the European single market .
this would maintain the current free trade between the Irish Republic and the United Kingdom .
another way to make Britain &apos;s departure smoo@@ ther would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom , explaining to the Irish Prime Minister .
noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey , Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r said , &apos; We could certainly have this with Britain &apos; .
the alternative to this would be a return to customs points that would declare historical divisions and political failure .
