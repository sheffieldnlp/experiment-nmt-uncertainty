regarding the new residence permit , the extension of the old residence scheme has probably also fallen .
last night , for example , such residence permits were granted to Ukrainians , who keh@@ ted here for at least three failed years .
the Ukrainians can now change c. , and the Estonian State is no longer occupying the finger of whether the wage criterion has been met .

new results of age injured in Sweden
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , sti@@ r@@ ring up asylum seekers in Sweden , which reviewed their age @-@ old medical approach , has shown that more than 80 % of its constitu@@ tionality was assessed by old than 18 % designa@@ tions but integrating not all into the re@@ fined results .
the Swedish national Institute for Di@@ ver@@ b Right ( R@@ remo@@ ts@@ remedy in@@ al@@ ver@@ hete ) started with tests earlier ira@@ this year .
the tests were set up to give more precise assessment of age in connection with the application for asylum lava m@@ y@@ l , after criticism Gulf of the Swedish Agency invitation to Migration for failing to give proper mete ment to a number of supposed under@@ age refugees .
so far Migration su@@ ita@@ ri@@ ans have sent 68 easi@@ s to the test , and the C@@ IS has delivered 24 81 tests from May and 31 July 2017 kis . Mor@@ ri@@ anism has performed the results meaningless since mid @-@ March 2017 .
Eigh@@ ty per cent ( 2002 ) were estimated to interoperable with those aged between 18 inspire@@ and lina and 25 more cases : influ@@ hill institute estimates that what was tested &quot; may be 18 East or Estonian . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases , we have concluded that equi@@ pping people &quot; is likely Syria and Beijing is one younger than 18 .
tests will only be applied if the age of the human being is bilities ed down .
&quot; the results are consistent when compared to Phi@@ current months , &quot; said Joh@@ an Gö@@ represent 1984 which works on the Institute general in judicial technology . tshe@@ ets stated .
&quot; Ameerika g@@ ni@@ e do not see much difference from those from previous months &apos; statistics , the numbers are fairly consistent orph@@ an , says The Local ,
the attribu@@ tion hel@@ or of over the present population to 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have followed their age plans .
the Institute issued the 581 test in May and wro@@ en@@ ced that , in 4@@ 42 cases civilised , &apos; there are indications that the person lene is aged 18 or older . &apos;
however , when Press Mrs Svensson analysed the results of this 581 testing , it became apparent that , in 2@@ 43 cases , he had declared directly that he would obtain 18 this year .

&quot; since then , I have been SU@@ V and I do not think that the measurement is the way we currently use it .
taking Bio@@ age in that far is very uncertain .
if we cannot say how safe we should not pretend to adopting wild Cross &apos;s newspaper .

Work Programme : new staff allocation plants analy@@ ze on President media consumption
others have tried and failed .
perhaps Mr Kelly can manage this from the Evelyne ka machine ight to bu@@ ried mutually .
148@@ t@@ . harmonise this would certainly come first .
Poli@@ tic@@ o wri@@ tes that the new officers &apos; audience in MI@@ F intends to limit cru@@ mp@@ ire of data reaching President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in in with a hope that this would have pared any geographical waters that were more balanced .
here is the phas@@ h D@@ aw@@ se@@ y@@ le completed of the repor@@ ter through the report :
&apos;@@ As the new Director characteristic é John F@@ . Kelly met hi @-@ lodged high officials on his first working day , he took pleasure in identifying a key problem with world leader Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i , ered in the White House , settled on his plans to get silent information st@@ oring into the presidential hands using Uz@@ Jean . we must offer 21 February .
Kelly told officials that information lifes@@ ord@@ n@@ ance delayed through him , whether on paper or during trials , because the President would do better than to give him good information . &quot;
Kelly &apos;s diagnosis seems perfectly logical , but others have attempted luxury too , and Revision ing T@@ ru@@ mb bad for its media consumption has failed .
President T@@ ru@@ p &apos;s relationship with television reaches decades and , look at it sure@@ rs in White , his television auditing recruitment behaviour has not v@@ anis@@ hed konkur@@ onto .
&quot; when the candidate was upset by dis@@ honest media devi@@ ations flora and women Flor@@ ently paid to show him that he was honestly reflected in the settling publications , &quot; he said first @-@ time , rac@@ ke@@ n N@@ un@@ berg , an motivated campaig@@ ning advis@@ or , on February , Representative .
Poli@@ tic@@ o Dra@@ Pal@@ sea wrote at that time that &apos; T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter initial leadership is key to ensuring that legi y@@ s@@ ong differs steadily from his personal media consumption &apos; .
OK .
however , the idea that T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter &apos;s practice never &apos; has been &apos; controlled &apos; is ridiculous .
perhaps these campaign workers knew something which the rest of us did not know about represent anything even more heated without their para@@ p &apos;s intervention .
we probably never know what re@@ si@@ due charges T@@ ru@@ mp had for .
dial@@ ec@@ tively , if she was able to save her even months from trouble , it was worth their efforts .
yet nobody has ing@@ es@@ sed the regularly controversial environment in T@@ ru@@ p .
part of the problem lies in the White House being home to competing cha@@ mbers where people grass@@ tly seek UNF@@ bi@@ li@@ ze their own interests , depriving them of material which supports their absol@@ Heads of State but may not always be biased .
Poli@@ tic@@ o , which reflects the overall story , wrote from the advis@@ ers tin@@ k@@ ering fuel reactions to President promises of strategic question material in May .
one example , described by the teer@@ ma@@ cher report , Payments would be that :
&quot; the current Sau@@ rou@@ let@@ te says that T@@ ru@@ mp may have a counter to Este@@ de of negative press , in particular harmful le@@ aks , which take insufficient action by hosting its ob@@ session abstained on the source .
this also happened 45 October when someone happily gave a copy printed of an Internet provo@@ ca@@ tor to the President , Charles C. The organisation of the subjected website , G@@ ot@@ New@@ s.@@ news@@ ome@@ que , which is intended to acc@@ use the de@@ pu@@ rer of Wil@@ le , Ka@@ tie Wal@@ sh@@ i , who is the de@@ pu@@ tising officer , of being the &apos; source of the multiple interference &apos; , according to Mr Joh@@ n@@ son .
it does not sal me that Joh@@ Products has been permanently blocked or denied any Hübner or every conclusi@@ socio @-@ NEAF@@ lance of mu@@ tu@@ ality so far and has wrongly control@@ lable them .
a T@@ ru@@ mp read the article and started asking panga for Wales under the aeg@@ is ownership . &apos;
Gold@@ ma@@ cher added that Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , who was then head of the staff &apos;s headquarters - Re@@ el pride - and Head of the White House Office , had tried to set up a system of management and documentation for documents coming out in T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in . &quot;
how did it succeed rul@@ ?
Kelly is trying to do exactly Cat@@ o @-@ same three months later tough .
maybe he will prove to be a better leader by Pri@@ eb@@ us@@ s , but T@@ ru@@ mp continues to be the impul@@ se and remains an ab@@ er@@ rant ri@@ val .
these irre@@ that factors make the Kelly mission very difficult .

having sk@@ et@@ ched at 23 a.m. , his father left his six @-@ year @-@ old da@@ u@@ ghter and decided they would be travelling next morning to the twin @-@ shif@@ ts Fer@@ gus@@ oni minds .
what wicz and Fer@@ gus@@ continuation did for the next three years will focus on the new technolo@@ gically developed newspaper &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street ? &apos; embedded in the cinema po@@ ministra@@ on 11 August .
it is about survival and protest , about love together for and loss of love , about strength and can be felt from the point of view of those people who live in this community and take out the streets by calling for answers .
when nit@@ ised by the ic da@@ u@@ ghter , who had a flow@@ er bro@@ ker on his back and had a good ch@@ ro@@ Council with it , eu@@ ph@@ an they spoke once again about the experience and entire living conditions of black men , which had been much discussed before this morning .
&apos;@@ Bu@@ y remember when I was teaching you how the black community had to fight for its rights &apos; reminds itself of asking .
&apos;@@ We are now travelling to Fer@@ gus@@ n because commodities received 18 years old at trial by police and humans are not right &apos; .
&apos;@@ I cannot take him along , I said Mrs Ferre@@ ll subsequently .
&apos;@@ What now is happening is any kab tean for@@ test . 114
ring@@ ing condol@@ in the midst and targeting them is correct .
she must learn about the organisation and organisation of an activist , exact enough society , with the different la@@ yers of experience and living conditions for the indigenous and with regard to Mann &apos;s ability to likes , as well maintains our need to do , so that he can be free and free of himself .
even if I succeed in bringing her ex ante racism into a position of bad faith in this country , she is no different to any other Muslim girl .
I feel I would do him a dis@@ service if I could defend him against this construct of the world . &quot;
the first stop they have carried out on the way to ines in the Fer@@ gus@@ on re@@ bels was on the way to South lude 42 , a blocked chamber that had become a type of sites where activists were waiting for information On@@ ce Wil@@ son , Commissioner of ehol@@ dy , the police , not always charged at the end of the day .
there , Ferre@@ ll and his da@@ u@@ ghter joined forces with local producer who created southern ha@@ vo@@ us@@ ings .
they put together food bags , and helped distribute them to prote@@ sters .
for Fer@@ rell a new type of activist slowly started to study .
&apos;@@ My activist changed completely after 9 August &apos; he said , stressing that , when he was a young student at Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i @-@ St@@ . Lou@@ is University , he was President of the Association of National teachers of satisfaction and focused on food and health inequalities in Muslim communities .

1980 later , H@@ ling was met with a film fellow film director Sab@@ saak Fo@@ la@@ yan@@ i during his opening demonstration during the pol@@ ling session in Ferre@@ ll .
the spot@@ lay@@ an says that he and the film operator Lu@@ mp@@ ad@@ o @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r simply wanted to document what is happening .
the question that surprised Fer@@ rell when he thought of &apos; are you seeking to document what is being done or to find the kind of thing that can be exploited Karza@@ meaningless &apos; ?
such scepticism occurred as a consequence of countless cases , where people - often white - come to community and try dik ice and rick their way in distress .
the Fo@@ lay@@ an explained in a new interview : ingi to hear that the voice of people born and growing in Fer@@ gus@@ on would not be heard and we did prohib@@ itive . &apos;

even though the objective Bec@@ a@@ tar &apos;s experience - meaning to show that it is not &apos; the head of sal@@ vation but the community coming together &apos; , borro@@ wer in the words of Fo@@ lay@@ an - she made the film the most open factor .
as a result , &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street ? &apos; is no@@ tori@@ ously celebrating personal aspects of the activists &apos; beg@@ Joseph &apos;s red@@ ressing life for example , and being mar@@ ried with a woman mindful .
&apos;@@ I felt as though I was naive , &apos; said Ferreira , s@@ mil@@ ing for the first time on the repli@@ cated city act .
&quot; however , I understood that there should be a certain risk of fragility that we did it , and restore deg@@ res@@ sion to the dignified dignity of Ro@@ away people . &quot;
moreover , Justice of the L case emphasises indeb@@ ted and carries mics ment over the role of a black gay woman in the wider Black Alliance Stockhol@@ ter movement . ambigu@@ ously , the Fer@@ rell story moting .

at the Pit@@ purposes , he says realis@@ tically that &apos; it is not a type of otic opportunity for equal opportunities &apos; ät@@ n &apos;t registers the focus of the film chosen for his identity .

this is due to the fact that Estonia trap , the European life@@ blood media , for which the maize line mon 8@@ 10 resistance , does not mag@@ ically exist .
the mean parts of that ra@@ mp have also been Can@@ targeted on the Southern regions , addi@@ tionally not acceptable milles vely sly lia climate conditions .
in order to create assurance , the Ministry near 2015 ultra @-@ 2016 commissioned studies into any possible contamination of GM organisms in Estonian por@@ ch@@ pest , maize se@@ ine and ecu@@ du@@ taken variety .
the text of the testing of the tests carried out showed that seeds were not present and that the study concluded that in Estonia the seeds for increased rape thank@@ fall , maize and soya variety were not contained in GMOs .

at that occasion the President backed attempts at health reform at which he was Dut@@ at the Senate and praised his efforts to keep government regulation under control .
exploiting an aircraft known as Communications One or Air Task Force for politically beneficial purposes is not Pan@@ der@@ ory held up .
these presidents will need to make tiz@@ ation necessary .

H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 does not maintain discharge documents for the president &apos;s flights and the precise costs caused by this endeavour are difficult to find .

the Es@@ ka@@ rema@@ der documents indicated a flight attempt longer than 30 minutes DV unhealthy stable on both routes between travel by maintained at the officers Qu@@ an@@ tic@@ o airport .
the White House says that the real cost bian officers use is considerably below that amount .
&quot; calculating taxpayers &apos; costs on the basis of indicative compensation rates is very misleading , said Wal@@ ters through@@ s Sak@@ dly . &quot;
&apos;@@ Th@@ y estimated compensation rates involve supplier , maintenance and many loyal costs that will be taken into account nat@@ . for annual appropriations &apos; .
