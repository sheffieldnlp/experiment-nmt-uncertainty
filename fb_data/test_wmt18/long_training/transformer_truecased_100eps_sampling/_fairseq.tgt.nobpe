new results of age injured in Sweden
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , stirring up asylum seekers in Sweden , which reviewed their age @-@ old medical approach , has shown that more than 80 % of its constitutionality was assessed by old than 18 % designations but integrating not all into the refined results .
the Swedish national Institute for Diverb Right ( Rremotsremedy inalverhete ) started with tests earlier irathis year .
the tests were set up to give more precise assessment of age in connection with the application for asylum lava myl , after criticism Gulf of the Swedish Agency invitation to Migration for failing to give proper mete ment to a number of supposed underage refugees .
so far Migration suitarians have sent 68 easis to the test , and the CIS has delivered 24 81 tests from May and 31 July 2017 kis . Morrianism has performed the results meaningless since mid @-@ March 2017 .
Eighty per cent ( 2002 ) were estimated to interoperable with those aged between 18 inspireand lina and 25 more cases : influhill institute estimates that what was tested &quot; may be 18 East or Estonian . &quot;
in 432 cases , we have concluded that equipping people &quot; is likely Syria and Beijing is one younger than 18 .
tests will only be applied if the age of the human being is bilities ed down .
&quot; the results are consistent when compared to Phicurrent months , &quot; said Johan Görepresent 1984 which works on the Institute general in judicial technology . tsheets stated .
&quot; Ameerika gnie do not see much difference from those from previous months &apos; statistics , the numbers are fairly consistent orphan , says The Local ,
the attribution helor of over the present population to 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have followed their age plans .
the Institute issued the 581 test in May and wroenced that , in 442 cases civilised , &apos; there are indications that the person lene is aged 18 or older . &apos;
however , when Press Mrs Svensson analysed the results of this 581 testing , it became apparent that , in 243 cases , he had declared directly that he would obtain 18 this year .
this medical age assessment method with x @-@ ratunities iles and agley MRT which then demonstrate a lack PNamide and radiologists has been criticised in some quarters . profitable examples have retain a critical focus in some quarters . ast version of this method of medical assessment .
one of the sceptics is the Enriogue Prefrescent Institute , whose missions will include the evaluation of people &apos;s biodiversity maturity , to find out whether rather than before or later normal audience Ján fastest .
&quot; since then , I have been SUV and I do not think that the measurement is the way we currently use it .
taking Bioage in that far is very uncertain .
if we cannot say how safe we should not pretend to adopting wild Cross &apos;s newspaper .
but Johan Gölapson of the Institute appropriately defended the severity ENP tests : &apos; in general , one certainly pean keep low the negatant risk of in @-@ depth entication for adults .

Work Programme : new staff allocation plants analyze on President media consumption
others have tried and failed .
perhaps Mr Kelly can manage this from the Evelyne ka machine ight to buried mutually .
148t. harmonise this would certainly come first .
Politico writes that the new officers &apos; audience in MIF intends to limit crumpire of data reaching President Trumpin in with a hope that this would have pared any geographical waters that were more balanced .
here is the phash Dawseyle completed of the reporter through the report :
&apos;As the new Director characteristic é John F. Kelly met hi @-@ lodged high officials on his first working day , he took pleasure in identifying a key problem with world leader Donald Trumpi , ered in the White House , settled on his plans to get silent information storing into the presidential hands using UzJean . we must offer 21 February .
Kelly told officials that information lifesordnance delayed through him , whether on paper or during trials , because the President would do better than to give him good information . &quot;
Kelly &apos;s diagnosis seems perfectly logical , but others have attempted luxury too , and Revision ing Trumb bad for its media consumption has failed .
President Trup &apos;s relationship with television reaches decades and , look at it surers in White , his television auditing recruitment behaviour has not vanished konkuronto .
&quot; when the candidate was upset by dishonest media deviations flora and women Florently paid to show him that he was honestly reflected in the settling publications , &quot; he said first @-@ time , racken Nunberg , an motivated campaigning advisor , on February , Representative .
Politico DraPalsea wrote at that time that &apos; Trumpi Twitter initial leadership is key to ensuring that legi ysong differs steadily from his personal media consumption &apos; .
OK .
however , the idea that Trumpi Twitter &apos;s practice never &apos; has been &apos; controlled &apos; is ridiculous .
perhaps these campaign workers knew something which the rest of us did not know about represent anything even more heated without their parap &apos;s intervention .
we probably never know what residue charges Trump had for .
dialectively , if she was able to save her even months from trouble , it was worth their efforts .
yet nobody has ingessed the regularly controversial environment in Trup .
part of the problem lies in the White House being home to competing chambers where people grasstly seek UNFbilize their own interests , depriving them of material which supports their absolHeads of State but may not always be biased .
Politico , which reflects the overall story , wrote from the advisers tinkering fuel reactions to President promises of strategic question material in May .
one example , described by the teermacher report , Payments would be that :
&quot; the current Sauroulette says that Trump may have a counter to Estede of negative press , in particular harmful leaks , which take insufficient action by hosting its obsession abstained on the source .
this also happened 45 October when someone happily gave a copy printed of an Internet provocator to the President , Charles C. The organisation of the subjected website , GotNews.newsomeque , which is intended to accuse the depurer of Wille , Katie Walshi , who is the deputising officer , of being the &apos; source of the multiple interference &apos; , according to Mr Johnson .
it does not sal me that JohProducts has been permanently blocked or denied any Hübner or every conclusisocio @-@ NEAFlance of mutuality so far and has wrongly controllable them .
a Trump read the article and started asking panga for Wales under the aegis ownership . &apos;
Goldmacher added that Rob Porter , who was then head of the staff &apos;s headquarters - Reel pride - and Head of the White House Office , had tried to set up a system of management and documentation for documents coming out in Trumpin . &quot;
how did it succeed rul?
Kelly is trying to do exactly Cato @-@ same three months later tough .
maybe he will prove to be a better leader by Priebuss , but Trump continues to be the impulse and remains an aberrant rival .
these irrethat factors make the Kelly mission very difficult .

what wicz and Ferguscontinuation did for the next three years will focus on the new technologically developed newspaper &apos; Whose street ? &apos; embedded in the cinema poministraon 11 August .
it is about survival and protest , about love together for and loss of love , about strength and can be felt from the point of view of those people who live in this community and take out the streets by calling for answers .

&apos;What now is happening is any kab tean fortest . 114
ringing condolin the midst and targeting them is correct .

even if I succeed in bringing her ex ante racism into a position of bad faith in this country , she is no different to any other Muslim girl .

there , Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with local producer who created southern havousings .
they put together food bags , and helped distribute them to protesters .
for Ferrell a new type of activist slowly started to study .

1980 later , Hling was met with a film fellow film director Sabsaak Folayani during his opening demonstration during the polling session in Ferrell .

the question that surprised Ferrell when he thought of &apos; are you seeking to document what is being done or to find the kind of thing that can be exploited Karzameaningless &apos; ?
such scepticism occurred as a consequence of countless cases , where people - often white - come to community and try dik ice and rick their way in distress .
the Folayan explained in a new interview : ingi to hear that the voice of people born and growing in Ferguson would not be heard and we did prohibitive . &apos;
the phlayan had already shouldered revolt with 15th Damon Damers , a regional artist known for his entitlement , to Princility in relation to sentenced prisoners .

even though the objective Becatar &apos;s experience - meaning to show that it is not &apos; the head of salvation but the community coming together &apos; , borrower in the words of Folayan - she made the film the most open factor .
as a result , &apos; Whose street ? &apos; is notoriously celebrating personal aspects of the activists &apos; begJoseph &apos;s redressing life for example , and being married with a woman mindful .
&apos;I felt as though I was naive , &apos; said Ferreira , smiling for the first time on the replicated city act .
&quot; however , I understood that there should be a certain risk of fragility that we did it , and restore degression to the dignified dignity of Roaway people . &quot;
moreover , Justice of the L case emphasises indebted and carries mics ment over the role of a black gay woman in the wider Black Alliance Stockholter movement . ambiguously , the Ferrell story moting .
two out of the three initiators derive the names of the Heminsurance multinational Trayvon Martin , after the killing of the Kurds ceremony in 2012 Rio : # BlackLivesMatter 1,5 , are homosexual .
