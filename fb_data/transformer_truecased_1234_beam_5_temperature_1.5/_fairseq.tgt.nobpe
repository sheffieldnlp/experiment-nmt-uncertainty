in Estonia and Spain , four members of the Cape Verde group were detained .
according to Mr Posselt , in Spain , the so @-@ called &apos; Cape Verde group &apos; was detained by the police , the leader of the Austrian army , Mrs Gulevich , who is known in the criminal world under the name of SpinKCape rovski .
Gulevich arrested in Spain was arrested at a court permit .
yesterday , the Court also took three suspects detained in Estonia .
it is suspected of being members of the so @-@ called &apos; Cape Verde &apos; criminal community aged between 27 and 57 years , who commit mainly drug crimes .
the alleged leader of the criminal community was detained in the province of Mala Miris in Spain .
in Estonia , three men were detained as a suspect , one of which has been collected according to data , and two are members of the criminal community .
the data collected indicates that tasks and roles had been clearly divided in the criminal community .
the purpose of criminal activities was to commit drug crimes and thus earn criminal proceeds , &quot; commented on the head of the pre @-@ trial proceedings in criminal cases , Public Prosecutor Vaila Verte .
&quot; we do not rule out that the circle of suspected criminals is increasing , &quot; the public Prosecutor added .
it is people who have previously been interested in law enforcement authorities , and some of them have been punished for drug crimes .
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been high throughout the investigation .
&quot; international cooperation has become commonplace for us , and this week &apos;s operation shows the success of cooperation , &quot; said Public Prosecutor Verte .
the head of the Central Criminal Police Service , ago in Leis , said that detention was preceded by an investigation lasting almost one and a half years .
&quot; in the first half of the week , we had a long history of work and , at the same time in Estonia and Spain , suspected of committing crimes , &quot; he said .
it added that central criminal police officers were instrumental in detention in Spain .
for years now , we have good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard .
these detentions are yet another message for criminals that we will get them from the other end of Europe . &quot; said Leis .
the information gathered so far makes it clear that men suspected of being free can continue to commit new crimes , which is why the Prosecutor &apos;s office requested their arrest and also approved by the court .
the man arrested in Spain is waiting for his surrender to Estonia .
property , vehicles and cash have been seized for confiscation under this criminal law .
the criminal prosecution procedure is carried out by a central criminal police office for organised crime and led by a public prosecution service .
he was sentenced to blackmail by the Mayor of Tallinn in 2005 and sentenced to five years imprisonment by SBlokland Gulevich .
in the middle of the last decade , Gulevi≈°it was regarded as the second most important in Estonia &apos;s criminal world following the Gendarmerie , Nikolai Tarankov .
Gulevich , from Cape Verde , appeared in Estonia &apos;s alliances at the beginning of the 1990s when he started to deal with blackmail in Tallinn .
Admittedly , he taxed taxi drivers and women on various hotels and ordered a monthly rotation tax on businessmen .
international joint operations , the confiscation of proceeds of crime and the entry into force of judicial decisions confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective .
for example , the latest court rulings , the eight accused of the so @-@ called Dikic criminal community , who confiscated EUR 80 000 of criminal proceeds , or the verdict against nine persons that Igor Aleynikov set up a criminal community in 2006 aimed at illegal trafficking of illegal cigarettes and trafficking in human beings in East Viruland and southern Estonia .
there has been a total of around EUR 71 500 in recorded crime revenues .
in these criminal cases , it has made progress that police officers exchange information and prosecutors with foreign colleagues on a daily basis and , if necessary , procedures are carried out in any European Union country .
the Civil Liberties Group warns of Missourisse travel
the National Association for the Advandad of the People of Colored People ( NANicaragua ) has warned people of discriminating policies and racist attacks in the State .
according to the Group &apos;s statement , &apos; The NASR issued for the State of Missouri State , valid until 28 August 2017 , calls on all African Americans to be particularly attentive and very careful when they move around the country , given the suspicious racial events that have taken place recently in the state and have also been highlighted here &apos; .
according to NATA , the group urged both the recent Missouri law , which makes it more difficult to win cases of discrimination , and also the fact that the country &apos;s regular lawyers &apos; targets are , to a large extent , minorities .
&quot; citizens &apos; rights are violated .
they are drifted because of their skin colour , beaten or slaughtered , &quot; &quot; said Ros Chapel , President of NASR City Star .
&quot; we have never received so much complaints before . &quot;
this is the first such warning issued by an organisation for the US state .
the group referred to events such as racist insults on musicians &apos; students at Missouri University and the death of the 28 @-@ year @-@ old black Sandersi .
Sanders died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of this year , after he was beaten in petrol by state and the Missouri police captured him without being accused of a crime .
furthermore , the report recently compiled by the Chief Prosecutor of Missouri , which shows that in the State car drivers &apos; cars are halted by 75 % more likely to be halted than white drivers .
&apos;For people to be aware and to warn their families , friends and collaborators about what might happen in Missouris , &apos; said Chapel .
&quot; people need to be ready , whether it is to take fun money or to inform relatives that they pass through the state . &quot;
according to the latest figures from the FBI programme on hate crime , 2,100 hate crimes were recorded in the Missouris in 2015 , which puts the state in a position of 16 in the country for similar offences .
a travel warning is also a response to the new Missouri law , which makes it difficult for the company to refer to the Court of Justice for reasons of discrimination in the quest for housing or work .
the American Civil Liberties Association ( American Civil Guard ) had previously issued travel barriers for Texas and Arizona following the adoption by those states of immigration laws obliging local authorities to arrest people for immigration offences because , according to ACLU , it increases racial profiling .
usually , travel warnings are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on other countries , but in recent times , interest groups have started to use this measure as a counter @-@ reaction to certain laws and trends within the US .
Hepatitis : what could anyone know about the different forms of this difficult disease ?
Hepatitis , or incineration , can be caused by five different types - A , B , C , D and E @-@ hepatitis virus .
all of these viruses provoke a fierce burst of the liver .
however , there is chronically a hepatitis B and C , which can continue to evolve into a cirrhop - a liver corps and a liver cancer .
the epidemiological Adviser of the Health Agency , KuSuu r , tells us that acute hepatitis disease events are the same in the case of all types of skimmed incineration - fever , fatigue , Embrance , Easperation , oineration , air pain , grey emissions , horse mackerel , meat and sweeteners , as well as swine and limasters .
the last hour of the disease also comes from the popular name of a litre burnt by cancer .
children can undergo hepatitis without disease phenomena .
the various types of household incineration can only be determined on the basis of laboratory research data .
Alpatitis may turn to chronic hepatitis and run for decades without disease phenomena , which means that the person may not know anything about his or her dangerous illness .
Mr Kuelar points out various forms of hepatitis and describes their culmination more closely .
Ehepatitis virus infections are spread from a disease to humans and infect us when eating contaminated food or drinking water , seals , emissions of infected human beings into hands and hands of foodstuffs , soils , objects , contact and consumption of drugs .
a hepatitis was carried out by family members and carers , people suffering from chronic liabilities , sex people with infections , sex men with men , drug users , countries with hepatitis A .
contamination can be prevented by vaccinations , in particular by recommending vaccination for people travelling a lot and at risk of hepatitis A .
in addition , it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements : to wash or disinfect hands , before using food , to wash all fruit and vegetables .
the hepatitis virus is spreading in connection with man &apos;s blood , in the breadings of drugs , in therapeutic treatment , in augmentation , in the use of blood @-@ contaminated meters ( toothmeters , pregnanatories ) , in the use of donors &apos; blood , in the sex treatment of hepatitis sufferers , and in the treatment of hepatitis sufferers to animals / newborn babies .
drug cells , sex partners of infected human beings , sex men with men , newborn mothers of infected mother , sick family members and carers , blood and other body liquids are exposed to health care , rescue workers and police officers , as well as people visiting countries with hepatitis B high diseases .
in order to prevent hepatitis , it is possible to vaccinate people ; in particular , it is recommended to vaccinate people who are at risk , as well as people suffering from chronic liabilities , HIV infections , sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes .
( b ) hepatitis other preventive measures are : non @-@ use of stranger hygiene and manbal devices , other sharp tools and systalstalstalgia , therapeulation and augmentation , and the use of condoms in the event of dangerous infections , or prevention of sexual risk taking place .
vaccination against hepatitis V is part of the National immunisation Scheme and free of charge for children in Estonia .
Hepatitis C virus is spreading when dealing with the blood of a person who is infected with the disease , when it comes to drugs incineration , therapeution , augmentation , the use of blood @-@ contaminated meters , the use of donor blood , the person of hepatitis bullet in sex , and hepatitis disease for animals / newborn babies .
drug users , sex partners of infected human beings , sex men with men , newborn mothers of infected mother , sick family members and carers , blood and other body liquids are exposed to health care , rescue workers and police officers , people with HIV infections , and passengers visiting countries with hepatitis C .
prevention measures for hepatitis C are : non @-@ use of hospitality hygiene and manbal devices , other sharp tools and systalstalgia , prophytoisation and augmentation , and condoms in the event of a dangerous mixture of infections .
there is no vaccine against hepatitis C .
d hepatitis contamination is caused by the Dhepatitis virus , which goes much further in the presence of the hepatitis B virus .
as a result , Dhepatitis Bhepatitis , combined with hepatitis B or superinfants , there are chronic hepatitis B sufferers .
blood and other body liquids , contaminated needles and needles , relatives and rarely infected animals are spread in contact with hepatitis virins .
the hepatitis hazard tax is chronic hepatitis B infections and non @-@ hepatitis B people .
an effective preventive measure is vaccination against hepatitis B vaccines , which also protects people from HIV infection with hepatitis virus .
e @-@ hepatitis viruses spread by feudal means of drinking water and food , including little heat @-@ treated beef , fish and seafood , donor blood , psychips and more infected animals .
passengers may be infected with high levels of E hepatitis disease in countries .
Ehepatitis preventive measures are compliance with the hygiene requirements : to wash or disinfect hands after slaughter , prior to food preparation and eating , after hospital care .
fruit and vegetables are washing ahead of consumption , avoiding eating little heat @-@ treated beef , fish and seafood , drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug consumption .
although , over the last few months , competitors tried four times to printing the Olympic winner , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Farah final hub took power and won 26.49.51 .
Mr Farah did not think for a long time , drawing the husband Tania and the children on his own path after the finalists .
this was a special moment for me .
I very much support my family .
it was wonderful to be with them , saying Farah to journalists .
Farah will focus its fifth title competition in London on the golden dump of 5 000 and 10 000 meters .
everything is possible if there are religions in it .
in spite of the title , Mrs Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;Connorm in Daam gold . Gustav Klimti Cup , Mr Bloch @-@ Baueri has an extraordinary story of &apos; synonymous with one of the works of art at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century in Vienna .
but even more deeply in history .
the inflammatory slope would have lost more influence on the attractive bandwidth , the narrowly subject would have been to be put on top of the extraordinary office allowed in the title .
at the moment , there would be some sort of two books : Gustav Klimti and his painting &apos; Daam gold &apos; for Adel Bloch @-@ Baueri , and a much greater and more comprehensive history of respected Jewish families and the German occupation , along with its aftermath in Austria .
the first third of the book will lead to a flourishing cultural life in the middle of Vienna , who himself owed to the Austrian capital , can hardly imagine how life went around Ringstrass more than a hundred years ago , or how all its head was turned when the climate invaded .
the concentration of cultural characters in one of the richest cities of Europe , seeing the name familiar with in the book , was felt like a gram in a more cultural way .
however , for example , the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a city in which there was an untreated arson and the highest level of suicide in Europe does not add anything to development .
or perhaps , however , every couple of paternalistic footballs also add colour to the cultural life of the beginning of the 20th century in Vienna .
dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
in the last decades of the 19th century , the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded , becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe .
nearly one in ten people in Vienna had a Jewish one during the Sajanditis .
elderly parents were also newcomers in Vienna , but by the time that Arad married itself twice to open the Czech sugar magnaad Ferdinja Bloch and Climate for his famous paints , his father had become the seventh largest bank in Habsbursts .
however , Adelet the whole life that he belonged to did not lead to .
if you look at &apos; Daam gold &apos; , it is difficult to believe that the end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ life infection of this kind of dar of socialism and dreamt of travel to the Soviet Union .
for 1907 , when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his husband &apos;s luggage from Climate Kong , it was the last six @-@ minute painting maker in Vienna .
at that time , 4 000 kroons were paid , a quarter of the price of a well @-@ established rural house .
the fact that , in the case of some marksmen , there was no suspicion of a master bubble with a modelta did not deter sugar magnaat .
as far as the deletion is concerned , the only certainty is that the relationship between the modelli and the artist created in the course of their work continued until the end of life .
Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;Connor - Daam gold .
Gustav Klimti Championship , Adel Bloch @-@ Baueri has an extraordinary record &quot; , Varrak 2016 , Aldo Randmaa , who translated English .
shortly before the start of the work with Adelem , the climate had visited Ravenna San Vitale , and the investigators believe that it was precisely there that the wonderful mosaic Erinna Theodort was an idea for the artist to make a golden portfolio known from Adeledeledeledeletion as a mosaic .
at the same time ( between 1907 and 1908 ) , the climate presented its &apos; Daam gold &apos; in Vienna in 1908 , was born one of the golden terrestrials .
art historians did not notice the similarities of two women .
what about nature is Hitler ?
&quot; I think to remember my friend Mr Klimmer , I am obliged to make him publicly available , &apos; Adel Bloch @-@ Bauer wrote , a few years after the departure of an artist ( Klimt died in February 1918 ) to the Director of the Belvedere Museum , and wanted their family &apos;s Klimti to go to museums .
six years prior to the death , the climate had produced one of the Adeles .
he also asked her husband to leave her two sports courses and four Gustav Klimti landscapes to Galeri in Austria in February 1925 .
in his words , she asked Mrs Mariana and Mr Luda for her sisters .
one year after the climate had finished the &apos; Austrian Mona &apos; annex , Viin Kacarriart de Akademine had attempted to get 17 @-@ year @-@ old Adolf Hitler , but fell through the drawing paper .
although sometimes Hitler &apos;s later anti @-@ Semitism is considered to be the reason for the fact that Jewish professors did not accept him in the academine , none of his culminants were actually Jews .
in any case , the role of the Austrian Galeri , referred to in Mrs Christ , had changed considerably by 1939 - it had become important to find decent works for a woman from the rich Jewish arts in Vienna .
Hitler &apos;s personal artistic musicians also served some work at home for As , but not for the climate .
Sixty years after the night of Nazi art , a 10 @-@ year @-@ old court dispute began between the Austrian Government and Bloch @-@ Bauer heirs .
it should just be noted at this point that , if the &apos; Snovel &apos; is seen in Belvedere Castle in Vienna , the &apos; Daam gold &apos; portrayed by Adel Bloch @-@ Bauer must be tracked to New York Neue Galeri .
and , before the Vienna War , to read the aforementioned book .
even if you do not plan to look at the climate &apos;s work , because at least my emotion , following the closure of the book , the subject of Nazis and Jews was sold more than USD 135 million around the mamal and modell Adel Bloch @-@ Bauer .
therefore , not so much a cabin , rather than a matribal fate - and a very moving story .
there was a great deal to facilitate the focus on events on the work done at the beginning of the book by the relatives of Bauots .
17 @-@ year @-@ old swimming in Canada was very close to Estonia &apos;s record .
in eating , gold was very close to the personal corn of its own 200 m glue swimming , at 2.16.62 .
the Tippppmark dates back to the 17 @-@ year @-@ old festival of Canadian jewellery championship 2.16.58 , was brokered by Priit Aavik Ujugation blog .
gold finally escaped the A @-@ finishing board of ten years .
in the Finally , he went through his distance to 2.15.76 and achieved a good 7th seat with a new , high level of excellence .
Estonia &apos;s record ( 2.15.13 ) , consisting of Alina Kendziorn , remained just over half a second .
in Estonia , gold rose all the time , and its latest personal top @-@ level mark is the fifth ever result of Estonia .
the young hope of the future lies at 100 m , 200 m and 400 m in balfire in Canada &apos;s adult Championships and 200 mm and 400 metres in bundling .
last week in Tuonto , there was a Canadian championship of jewellery , and gold made a successful start there too .
he won 200 mm in baltuous shuttling with a silver medal of 2.03.22 .
so quickly , it was swamped as a distance campaigner last in 2008 .
in Estonia , only Estonia &apos;s record publican , Elina Parkika , has distanced itself more quickly from the Golden era .
in Canada , a vibrant champion won a top 56.66 of the new Estonian season with 100 mm vouchers .
for example , she has been distanced by a century more quickly by her grandmother , Kertu ly Alnek .
he arrived at another 100 m in the open exchange of theatre swimming in his personal top @-@ stock , at 1.03.69 .
for half a long distance , he won only the seventh seat when he sleep at 2.17.31 .
gold is currently leading Estonia &apos;s candbook at four distinct distance .
President Trump goes on holiday , critics insured teeth
the holiday season is in hand - it is also a nonsense for the President of the United States , Donald Trul .
however , since the Trump has so far been one of the President who has taken the most holidays , the critics are wearing teeth .
according to the United States VIS and the CNN , the President intends to have 17 @-@ day leave in a static golf club in Bedminster , located in New Jerseys .
although the President &apos;s leave began yesterday , opponents of Trumpi have been speaking for weeks now .
they are complaining to the Olympic Games of too frequent cleansing .
it is precisely that the President is entitled to spend a weekend in his Florida , Virginia and New Jersey in cotton .
by the way , the Trump has not cleaned the President for its 196 working days .
George W. Bush , for example , was able to have 67 days on this holiday , with Barack Obama half less than the Trump , but only 21 days .
however , it tends to foolish things quickly .
ten days after he became President , when he received the Trump , he said , &apos; 60 minutes &apos; , that there would be no time left for him to leave , because a great deal needs to be done .
he also expressed his outrage about Barack Obama &apos;s holiday three years ago .
on Twitter , the current President wrote : &apos; while Obama is on holiday , plays golf , the brakes and the j√§ssist concerts are going on , the journalists in exile are pulling their heads out &apos; .
according to white house officials , 17 @-@ day golf club visits to pollen do not exist .
instead , it is officially referred to as &apos; working leave &apos; , during which Trul does not have the time to read the Olympic Games or for other sporting activities .
in addition , there was also a second reason for working leave .
it is precisely that there would be a change in the western prison system in the White House , which is why the entire staff had to leave it .
the West Bank is also located in the Ovalkaker and other presidential premises .
&quot; I do not believe that any one of you would like to be in the West in August if there were 38 degrees and no conglomerates , &quot; said Lindsay Walters , the white house spokesperson , who stressed that the President would continue to work on holiday .
where President Trump is going to spend 17 days , you get an idea of video .
blocking critics on Facebook do not apply to public office if you do not tolerate voters &apos; criticism .
the father of our country knew so much about disadvantaged media coverage .
the Americans loved Mr Washington , but the newspapers did not take a long time to bull him for everything , from internal politics to his political principles .
of course , he was annoyed by the criticism .
but he did not force his critics to remain silent .
because , in the year 1783 , Washington said that &apos; freedom of expression may be taken away from us , and in darkness and silence we may be chaired by sheep on slaughterhouses &apos; .
this brings me to Maryland kuberner Larry Hogan , who is struggling to be more in Washington .
they have blocked and erased at least 450 people who expressed their views on their official Facebook page .
and at the beginning of the week , the American Union for the Freedom of Citizens ( American Civil Nations Union ) addressed him to the courts for this reason .
the officials of the Kuberner &apos;s officials turned the action into empty and web commentates into &apos; who is interested ? &apos; .
&apos;This is just Facebook , &apos; many people said .
but that counts .
and this is particularly important when it comes to a man like Hogan .
it is an overwhelming democratic state with amazing popular Republican tourage .
his approval percentages are the second highest ranking among the country &apos;s 50 Governor .
Hogan is not a reactive sight .
it has led the state firmly and remains strictly firm on its own principles .
in addition , she has used her as a major tool for communicating with his constituents quite deliberately on Facebook , presenting , for the first time after the chemical pill , for example , his bitter head .
therefore , a public forum with a formal label , managed by the staff who pay taxpayers &apos; dollars from Kenya , is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
Hogan &apos;s press representative , Amelia Chess , defended in an interview given to Washington Posselt the behaviour of the Governor , arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than moderecasting .
however , it is far too easy to taste the picture of Internet browsing on the Internet , spammers or people full of hatred .
the post spoke to a number of people who were blocked by Hogan .
and that is precisely what they are really the people who communicate with their elected leaders : the user , the owner of the company and the pastor , and not Internet controls .
they all said that their comments were respectable , thought @-@ out and not ropaste .
Pastor quoted the Bible in his post , urging the Khogan Catholic movement .
a lawyer from Marylan , Bowie , Lakshmi Sarma Raman , did not instigate hatred , but rather hate crimes .
&quot; I said , politely , that I am disappointed because he has not responded to hate crime or other recent news , &quot; he wrote the editorial news story in his country .
&quot; I also do not like the idea that how many people comment on the same subject , some of them call it an indifferent collective effort instead of acknowledging that it is a great deal of citizens &apos; concerns . &quot;
what the Governor &apos;s officer called &apos; targeted spam attack &apos; would probably invite others to &apos; public support &apos; .
the age of Facebook makes it easy to reconcile messages by simply blocking criticism or deleting negative comments .
it is much cleaner than before when it came to sending out workers to do the same , so that they aggregate newspapers with critical editorial headlines and burn them or arrest the protesters and force them to remain silent .
however , that is exactly what is happening now , just digitally .
Hogan is not the first public official criticised for making Facebook and other social media toothless .
President Trumpi has accused Twitter users who have been blocked from Twitter .
one of the first key judgments on this matter was made last week in Virginia .
Mr James C. Cacheris , the US civil servant , decided in Alexandria that Mr Loudouni &apos;s Board of supervisors violated the first revision of the Constitution when he blocked the voter on his Facebook page .
in Ktucky , the Governor Matt Bevinit ( R ) also visited ACLU Facebook and Twitter for use .
this should not be so difficult .
there was a similar impact on affordable postal costs in Washington than on the Internet .
between 1776 and 1800 , the number of newspapers and anonymous writers stunned his way of leadership .
even then , Washington had to deal with anonymous controls .
people wrote letters to newspapers from pseudo @-@ unionyms such as Juricola , Valerius , Belisarius and Portius , making the decisions of Washington recoup .
according to historical documents which have been compiled as part of the Water @-@ based George Washington magazine , he burned his cabinet with petitions criticising his views on twinning , trade and shipping agreements with Britain .
but he did not force them to remain silent .
freedom of expression , differences of opinion and debates are fundamental pillars of our country .
and proper management means accepting it .
Ronan Rafferty hopes of the comfort of Renaissance Cclub &apos;s home territory
the former President of Europe , Ronan Rafferty , hopes of comfort over the next three days of East LoER , Renaissance Club golf courses taking place 25 .
the people of Northern Ireland , who were in the vicinity of Archerfield Linony last year in the run @-@ up to the last round of Mr Paul Ealna , have staged into a new place of engagement , and will play the role of the founder of the club and executive leader , Jerry Sharid , rather than his own .
&quot; I saw Renaissance Club built , and now we can see how the club is blowing in full glory , &quot; said Rafferty .
&quot; players see the path in their best shape ; it is in a perfect state .
Jerry has done an excellent job in setting up this place .
she is a keen supporter of golf games and proud of what has been achieved here .
this will allow an excellent presentation of the path . &quot;
Ingan ever expects to be able to defend the title for the first time , even though the man has won both European Toubon and the European challenge Touril during his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; this sends a very special feeling , &quot; said Sethportis , a committed player .
&quot; I was unable to defend my Extremadura Orange , because it was taken away from my competition calendar one year after my victory .
it is mathematical to come back to this chicken .
this is an excellent place to play a golf .
I remember the memories of last year , for me and for my wife , Mrs Sharon , last year &apos;s victory was special .
it was a very special period that we will always bear in our hearts . &quot;
Gary Orr will return to the competition once again on his country &apos;s soil , who joined the European Works Agency later this year , when he became 50 .
this is his first event in Scotland since the participation of Aberdeen Bank in 2013 .
&quot; it is always a little more important to play at home , &quot; said Helensburgh &apos;s man Orr .
&quot; Denmark did well , but at the same time it was interesting to add .
I have enjoyed playing again enormously and quite rightly demonstrated golf games .
I am pleased that things are going on so far . &quot;

poverty and death of Indonesia in gold @-@ stricken areas
when Barina Degei is preparing dinner , he does not use lead .
he seldom uses even a boy .
Indonesia &apos;s tar in the capital of the Municipality of Papua Riprovince Paniai in the majority rotail places its housewife in the local language in place in the direct replacement of the bar to be invited .
in half an hour &apos; time there will be a fire in the dared sludge and there will be an eager skins with uncoded hands .
Degei is silenced from the mud to theory and , at the same time , it is also doing its daily homework , for example , washing the water of crafts coming from nearby nearby sex .
the ball plays a role in an untenable room .
since she is a mother of four women , she has not been allowed to take care of any possessions .
Pol√ºgaamia is commonplace here on May .
late work , however , may be dangerous for the vast majority of Somalis &apos; masters to be unemployed and many of them drink hard , as well as soldiers here .
&quot; no one dares to go around after 5 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; he says .
it is a rare pilot in the country of Papua Bauer , a former Dutch colony which was integrated into Indonesia in 1968 following a referendum which only made 1 026 older people voting hand in front of the forces .
in the direction of moving towards a rapid Yakarta government , which liberated the Dutch people from the supremacy of power , it will continue to keep the region under strong control , preventing foreign journalists and human rights supervisors .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pope and Western Pope , so independent Papua New Guinea remained eastern of the island .
in order to be able to achieve this , the majority is both a remote and abandoned place , and a 5 @-@ hour journey from the capital of the province of Jayapuru will have to fly to Nabimel for 90 minutes and then pass through the rental car .
there is no public transport .
the city of approximately 19 000 inhabitants is made up of columns surrounded by carmbs and covers lainous iron rockets , which have been transformed into different ruins .
very few indicators have undertaken a journey here , not to mention journalists , nor have there been almost any foreigners here .
prior to the arrival of Christian missionaries , Mrs Mee Pago &apos;s paints were marathon with the name of Tamee .
there were other changes .
&apos;We were not accustomed to wearing such clothes , &apos; Degei says , referring to its colourful cradle to the market , the fire to the pluustery and the private anthem .
&quot; prior to that , we were only wearing a plant cow . &quot;
Papua Indonesia is the poorest province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and infant mortality and illiteracy statistics are one of the worst in Asia .
however , it is also a golden country in Indonesia .
just 100 km away from Paniao , which is a mountainous province of 153 000 inhabitants of New Jersey , the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Grasberg , which belongs to a company operating in Phoenixis Fbetreport McMoran .
approximately USD 3.1 billion worth of gold and copies were extracted from Fre in 2015 alone .
in addition , it is possible to contend with supplies of raw wood , worth an estimated USD 78 billion .
however , these riches are the source of the suffering of boats , as they result in the suffocating presence of a powerful Iranian army .
the New York Times study in 2005 showed that Freexport in the years 1998 @-@ 2004 paid local troops and military units about USD 20 million , including up to USD 150 000 to a single victim .
the attempts made by speculators to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden hall , and they are seamlessly betrayed .
according to human rights activists , more than 500 000 boats have been killed since 1959 and thousands more have been raped , tortured and imprisoned by the Iranian army .
according to the Committee on Human Rights in Asia , the massacre in the mountains in Papua arhus in the 1970s was the dimension of genocide .
last year alone , more than 3900 peaceful protesters were arrested by the Colombian police in the region .
the 2016 report of Birsbane &apos;s Grand Archbishop will contain testimony to the atrocities committed last year , such as extrajudicial executions , torture ( rape and electric blowers ) and the brutal repression of peaceful protests .
&quot; it is difficult to read the number of victims , as such incidents take place every week , &quot; says Andreas Harsono , the investigator of Human Rights Watch , Indonesia .
there have been even stronger blockades , as Papua natural resources have led to the influx of new settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia .
83 % of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians , but demographics are changing , as there are black economic migrants coming from the islands in Indonesia from Barva , Kalimantan , Sumatra and Sulawsi .
popular canteens are sold in the Queen and mixed vegetables by gado @-@ gado @-@ gado , which are serted along with ground level .
they cannot compete with them .
&quot; migrants started selling heroes and vegetables more cheaply than local boats on the traditional market , &quot; said Androulla Andersson , born in Paniai , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old beekeeper who came to the capital of the province , Jayapplause .
&quot; Syrians Fronmama @-@ Mama &#91; women &#93; painting boats are therefore losing their market share . &quot;
the President of Indonesia , Joko Widodo , who is well known to the people as Jokow , promised in his election campaign in 2014 to deal with these inequalities and human rights violations in Pope .
the former pub won 27 constituencies , including Paniai , on its way to the presidential Palace of Jakarta .
however , there has been very little change in the Pope and the local feel cheated .
&quot; our hearts have been broken because , in 2014 , we voted in favour of Jokow in the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes with regard to the restoration of justice , &quot; says apprenticeships .
in fact , just two months after Jokow took office in October , Paniai was in a low position .
on 7 December 2014 , 11 children in the Tyrotail stunned on Christmas when two Indonesian soldiers beauted blinded blindness .
born children said to them that they should include front lights .
according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai , one of the soldiers insulted their voting tone and returned later to four soldiers .
according to the victims and spectators , in the words of the victims , in the &apos; drink @-@ driving force &apos; soldiers hunted children and deceived them with their guns .
then one of the soldiers was shot among children .
one child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Yulianus Yeimot , was so brutally beaten that he fell into the home .
a few hours later , a close electoral Commission building was burnt down , and things went further next day .
some 1 000 young people came together in order to claim justice to the local police department and the military management centre .
they carried mee pago tricks of waita @-@ tantsu during which poultry songs were buried and buried .
some protesters started to lecture the police and the military .
&apos;When the crowd shows resistance more than three times , let them down , &apos; the official document , which has seen a magazine of time but has not been issued to local media publications , says it was said .
the elderly city of Kego Koto , Yeremias Kayme ( 56 ) , has felt a threat and called for peace to be maintained by asking the people to go home .
no one had the will to listen .
&quot; returning me to the left , I was suddenly shot in touch , &quot; he said , in a magazine magazine in his private colours , at the blood of a tree .
we still do not know who the fire was , but it says that in the month it came from soldiers &apos; rigs .
&quot; there was a lot of people , a great deal in the House , &apos; adds him .
the local man , Alfius Youw , was shot on his guns three times , according to a councillor .
&quot; let me wait on him and I watched him through as a body to make sure that he is with him , &quot; said the magazine holidays synnically in Yohanes , who use only one name , like many characters .
&quot; I have seen that he has died ... Snovel lew . &quot;
Dr Yotje Mende , Chief Police officer , said to the reporters that he was subject only to the security of his department because it was attacked .
&quot; we need to defend ourselves when we are threatened to kill , &quot; said Vice @-@ President Pudjo Sulistiyo , the spokesman for the Police Service , in 2015 .
&quot; this is a matter of life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young protesters were killed and many injured .
the news about the killings arrived in Jakartail only on the next day .
three weeks later , Jokowi Jayapuras held a passionate speech in which he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and allowed abuses to be dealt with in Pope .
&quot; I want to resolve this case immediately so that it will never happen again in the future , &quot; he said .
security minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would establish an alternative mechanism for dealing with human rights crimes .
however , almost immediately the excuses followed .
&quot; most crimes took place a long time ago .
some of them took place in the 1990s and the early 2000s .
the point is that we are committed to resolving these crimes , but we have to follow certain processes , &apos; he said .
however , when he talked about the magazine on 5 June in Jakartas , Wiranto withdrew his words by saying that he had no intention of setting up a mechanism to deal with complaints in Pope .
instead , he said that &apos; everything would be resolved by law &apos; .
the Wiranto , who has been accused by the United Nations of crimes against human rights in relation to more than 1 000 deaths in East Timor during the 1999 bloody referendum on independence , said that 11 crimes against human rights had already been resolved in Pope , including what happened in Paniais .
the families of the victims of Paniai adopted such assertions with gloom .
&quot; I have been intercepted four times over the last three years , but no progress has been made , &quot; said Yohanes .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he is still living in fear for years later .
&apos;I am afraid , &apos; he says .
&quot; I am afraid that the army will arrest me , I am afraid I will be shot . &quot;
his brother d Yacobus confirmed that the people of Paniai are afraid of this incident .
he said that he was beaten by the army after helping to bury four victims .
&quot; I had to be looked by the army after burying the bodies , &apos; he says .
executions have not stopped .
on Tuesday , the inhabitants of the Egyptian police were shot in the Paniai neighbouring Paniaam in Deiyai .
one person was killed and 17 wounded , including children , when he went to war between the inhabitants of the village and the head of the construction company , who refused to transport an unconscious man to hospital .
the male people , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ravianus Douw , who drowned nearby rivers trying to fish , died on their way to hospital .
the recent inhabitants of villages protested on a construction site before the company office .
according to the police , the people of the villages were lecturing policemen to stoning , the latter having responded to warning bells .
however , according to local reports , mobile Britons ( Iranian military police ) started to shoot at the people by killing one person .
&quot; we were in great panic , we are afraid of revenge , &quot; said Windows 29 years of Domingda Badii , who lives close to the hospital and saw injured insects .
&quot; I have deceived myself in my house for two days . &quot;
Mr Deiyai &apos;s Parliament has called for the prosecution of the police officers involved and the withdrawal from the area of the police &apos;s mobile Brigade .
Paniai has always been a problem for the Government of Indonesia .
the lack of meaningful development feeds the dissatisfaction of the meals , moni , dans and dammal tribes living in Papua haljendava .
many of them have signed up to the army of insurgents who , according to themselves , defend the rights of painants , jumping attacks and kidnappings among Iranian soldiers .
some VPL leaders come from Pania , including Tadius Yog and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .
in response to this , over the last few years , under the pretext of defending the sovereignty of a state , the army has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of people .
some of them will never happen again .
among the people of Papua Islands , Panians are known as &apos; tragic forgotten place &apos; .
poverty feeds dissatisfaction .
the small rice that is sold in the majority is too expensive to buy locally .
Leib is the same unattainable .
the people themselves cultivate all their food , mainly the Bah√° , as well as some fruit and vegetables .
farming is the work of women , each of whom is able to care for four or five ruins .
they usually hold most of the receipt to the family ; the rest is sold on the local market .
only 10 000 Indonesian premises ( 75 cents ) are paid by the 10 Baha &apos;s .
over time , economic inequalities have been exacerbated between heavy boats and new migrants , who have arrived a great deal from the opening up of new routes at Nabire airport .
the few jobs that exist go to better educated and more prosperous migrants .
speculators themselves often do not have the capital or the necessary skills to do a competitive business .
&quot; young people are not interested in leaving the village because there is neither jobs nor money , &quot; says John Gobai , President of the Paniai tribal Council .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from the Pope .
in addition , there will be severe restrictions on foreign media .
French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were extradited earlier this year because &apos; they did not follow the relevant practices &apos; , even though they had a rare film permit .
according to Vice @-@ President Pichm Kine , Human Rights Watch , Vice @-@ President of the Asian department , the election pledges made by Jokow have not been carried out to lift the restrictions placed on reporters to promote transparency and development .
&quot; journalists attempting to make reports from the most peaceful provinces in the East of Indonesia and from the Western Pope threaten the rejection and blacklist of Madagascar , &quot; said in his statement .
the lack of a satellite view of the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government is largely limited to its immediate neighbours .
in March , six of the Pacific countries , Bahrain , Nauru , Belau , Tupain , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands alike , urged the United Nations Human Rights Council to examine &apos; various large @-@ scale crimes &apos; in Pole , including the shooting of Paniai .
the same countries have historically supported VPL .
Arrmanatha Nasir kiss , spokeswoman at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia , withdrew charges from the group , saying to the press : &apos; in Indonesia , democracy and freedom of the press still exist so that evidence of cases against human rights is difficult to bury &apos; .
the local people want more foreign governments to heed .
when the Dutch official delegation visited Jayapurat on 4 May , the country &apos;s Ambassador for Human Rights , Mr Van Bartiga , the local people intercepted the meeting , but wanted to be anonymous , according to the source , to remain silent , urging : &apos; we want freedom &apos; .
new presidential elections will take place in Indonesia in 2019 , but boats do not believe that they will vote again in favour of Jokow .
&quot; Jokow is a man with good intentions , but surrounded by people involved in the shooting of Paniai , &quot; says Hobai , President of the tribal Council .
he wants to give Jokow the impression that not only do the people of Paniai continue to live under the threat posed by the predatory army , but they are hard hit by poor education and health services .
according to Gobai , the people of Paniai , like other boats , regard their voice to Jokow as the debt that they have to pay .
&quot; they do not need money , they want justice , &quot; he says .
in spite of threats and intimidation , the families of the victims of the fire in Paniai were able to cope with yet another symbolically controversial response by Yemen , which swept into one of the victims &apos; bodies of the police force and the army to the land in question .
knowing that justice can never be put on its feet , they at least do not allow those responsible to forget their crimes .
&quot; one of our family members was killed , &quot; says Yacobus with a shot .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
negover of Dubai Torch &apos;s pilots came under the carpet for the second time .
on Friday , one of the world &apos;s biggest residential storms in Dubai was eaten , forcing hundreds of people to flee this 337 metre of age and a 79 @-@ stroke construction .
this is the second fire which , for just two years , has been ravaged by a high level of radiation called the Turin case , or the Thimvikur .
the building was evacuated , none of the injuries were reported and there were any direct causes of fire .
&quot; we sleep and threw out the fires and people &apos;s fears .
let us wait for the tour , and it took about 10 minutes for us to get down to the 50th order , &apos; said to Reuterans one of the people who called themselves George .
according to Dubai &apos;s civil protection officers , fire @-@ fighters were also deleted at around 4 o &apos;clock in the morning at local intervals ( 00.00 GMT ) and hijacked the building .
the government said that it was working to ensure shelter for those affected .
this incident can once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on high external soil worldwide .
a study carried out by the Turin Management Board after the fire in 2015 found that the most damage had been suffered by fabrics such as decoral panels and insulation on foreign soil .
the British police have said that they believe that the insulation of the London Grenportfolio Tower , together with its ambassadors , could have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire that took place there in June , killing almost 80 people .
see : these phones are likely to receive sales cards in the autumn
it is time for televisions and cynicism , because the telephone manufacturers will then disclose their new models of excellence .
Samsung Galaxy S8 , Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia Premium came to sale in the spring , and new hitt telephones are expected in the autumn .
according to the Tele2 marketing and sales Director , Christian Semother , today &apos;s flagship ships are characterised by an innovative design , an outrageous shandnner , the serser @-@ servani 4K resolution , a screen and a ultra @-@ fast process .
Samsung Galaxy S8 , in the world of technology , was a major source of attraction , which is also at the top of Estonia &apos;s smartphones &apos; sales table .
the autumn will allow clergy sufferers to fly even more haste , more resilient adage , better cameras and greater water and customs security .
he added that , on the basis of rumours , you can already speculate and predict four top @-@ level models , which are likely to conquer today &apos;s sales tables .
these four &quot; smart phones top &quot; models will reach the boys in the autumn of this year .
expected iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach boys by mid @-@ September .
however , there is a lot to be gained from the new Apple model , which can and can be done .
if iPhone 7 did not lead to significant differences between iPhone 6s , Apple &apos;s 10th birthday is expected that the new model will be completely different from previous ones .
there has been talk of four colours : black , White , Sweep and chromium .
one of the elements of the new design is probably the screen , which covers all the telephone front , has been lost at home , and fingerprints have been built into the screens .
Mr JonyIve , Director of Apple &apos;s design , is calling for the new iPhone model to look like a glass .
there has also been talk of an iPhone version .
in addition to the head @-@ up , the unmanageable charging and a more high @-@ quality camera , we can expect faster A11 processes .
this is certainly one of the most expected smart phones in the year .
the outsourcing of the new model Galaxy Spring 8 will begin on 23 August .
there have been a lot of rumours about what new Galaxy Plan 8 will look like .
Admittedly , even more business users are meant , and S pen allows even greater functionalities .
the telephone fund should have two cameras , one of which is a lainurt and one with a narrow view to teleobjects .
at the moment , no one yet knows what the two susceptiums are capable of , but in any case this is the first test of Samsung , which is certainly comparable to iPhone 8 for quality .
however , we are eagerly awaiting 23 August .
although Nokia has sold sales this year with three smart phones headed by Nokia 6 , their flagship vessel , Nokia 8 , which is already presented on 16 August , is still missing .
we look forward to a screen stretching from 5.3 to the bottom line and to an extraordinarily fast Qualcomm Sscarce dragon 835 processes and a more resilient tandem .
in the case of Nokia , there is also talk of aluminium corps and significant levels of water and customs security IP68 .
similarly to Samsungone , Nokia &apos;s new model has two stunning camera , an optimist produced by the company Zeiss .
once the Sony firm flagship has been XZ Premium so far , the manufacturer has confirmed that in the near future at least two smartphones with even more innovative functionalities will be added .
we are waiting for a smartphone that is a little more modest than XZ Premium , but at least as good or better .
on the new Sony model , it has been speculated that its screen is at least hot .
what the reality is , we can already see right now , because traditionally Sony has unveiled its autumn flag vessel at IFA , which will take place between 1 and 6 September this year .
according to transcripts leaked by telephone calls , Trump of Mexico pressed for payment of the border wall .
the Washington post unveiled telephone calls between US President Donald Trumpi and Mexican and Australian Heads of State .
on 27 January , Enrique Pena Nieto , the Mexican President , went on a telephone call to put an end to public proclamation that he did not intend to pay for the proposed border wall .
the American President warned him about his public condemnation of the wall , saying : &apos; you must not say this to the press &apos; .
the Trubunch made a promise in his presidential campaign to build the wall and age on the southern borders of the United States that Mexico would pay for this project .
transcriptors were also published in his first speech with the Australian Prime Minister , Malcolm Turmes , revealing intense debate .
Trump said to Turunele that the agreement whereby the United States takes refugees to Australia is &apos; ridiculous &apos; , &apos; nervous &apos; and &apos; rum &apos; . he stated that the agreement that was made during the Obama Administration would give him the impression &apos; guide &apos; because he has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States .
the Trump ended the speech by telling the Turunele that &apos; this was the day &apos;s most unpleasant speech &apos; .
the national court did not take a complaint against the city of OC MRP Liine in the event that the city of Tartu rejected their offer for the procurement of bus and coach transport between July 2019 and 2029 .
this is a letter rejected by Anfour Aputin Aputin , Head of the Tartu Civil Service , because the offer did not meet the requirements .
this is the procurement of public transport in Tartu city for the period from 01.07.2019 to 30.06.2029 .
MRP city Liine referred to the Supreme Court of Justice to the District Court ruling .
the national court did not act .
although many people in the social media complain that their night is disturbed by the cut off from the Weekise Festival , and the entire city is full of screens , there are also many who do not have to say any bad words about a permanent festival .
I am even positively surprised that the brakes were so polite in the shop .
I did not see any misrepresentation or courtesy .
even so , I saw &apos; , there is a wonderful wave .
after all , it is a good thing that there will be , there will be , and there will be joy , of the Persia , which has stayed like winter , &apos; , he will gladly add .
there is no cradle in the tyranny of Ranny .
if , when living in the city of the centre , he was still listening to playing music , then the music has not yet arrived at his homework .
&quot; but I hope I will hear , &quot; he will gladly say .
in Agnes , who talked with a fire , it also says that the Grand Festival is rather a good thing for Perter - it will make a significant contribution to the turnover of local merchants .
he also welcomes the fact that so many houses have come to the visitors &apos; capital in the summer .
the woman of Peolives does not matter .
even though I am no longer on the coast , it is nice that rand has revived .
and it is good that the people are moving , and this has been the case three times &apos; , a woman says .
the first time was probably a little worse .
then perhaps there were complaints , he is wondering .
it is true , however , that , according to him , what is happening on the ground is normal for the capital cities in the summer .
&quot; this Weekise is a very good prophmo for our little city , says Harri , who is on the park .
life and m√∂ll have also failed to bury his elurtm .
but for it ?
we should all pull together .
think about how it would be better to communicate between nations .
after all , music does not mislead .
this does not happen , although I live near it .
&quot; good people can save and have nothing to do , &quot; he says .
visitors coming to Slovenia are , according to him , courtesy .
&quot; of course , they have joined them a little , but young people are young people and heroes God - give but be people and we can do it ! &quot;
painful residents have moved away from somewhere by then , whether to relatives or to acquaintances .
&quot; however , in general , the festival has a positive impact on life - people like such melu , and they are talking to the University with the children of Persia .
his family , too , does not disrupt the festival model , even though last year it went even further than it was today .
last summer , we heard more .
we live outside the city itself , that in fact there is a long way away from the River Perter , &apos; he talks .
Pearson cuts 3 000 more jobs and reduces dividends to revitalise business
the British educational company Pearson said on Friday that he will cut 3 000 more jobs and reduce his interim dividend by 72 % , thereby launching another restructuring programme to deal with business @-@ threatening distress .
these jobs , which , according to John Fallon , are likely to be made redundant at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , add to the 4 000 posts lost during the previous restructuring process .
Pearson announced in May his plan to cut expenditure by another GBP 300 million ( USD 394 million ) under the third expenditure reduction programme in order to try to revitalise businesses that have been hit by the transition to high @-@ speed digital learning .
the company , which agreed to sell last month at Penguin Random House to its partner company Bertelsmann , said that their expectation for a year has not changed since the sales income increase was announced to GBP 2.05 billion in the first half of the year .
on Sunday , the rainforest continues stubbornly with the rains .
in Estonia , on Sunday , the rainfall comes from the sun with the rainforest , and the wind outbreaks are at times very strong .
in Estonia , the Ecolabel comes up with explanations in the cloud .
on several sides there is a rainfall , there may well be an abyss .
between 5 and 11 in the south @-@ west , the outbreaks up to 14 , islands and coasts up to 18 mm / s .
air temperature is between 13 and 17 degrees .
the day will be buried with a mixed picture .
on several sides , there is amplification , there is a possibility .

attack in Kabul : NATO soldier killed in suicide attacks
the suicide bomber , according to officials , attacked military convoys in the capital of Afghanistan , Kabul , killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others .
in NATO &apos;s statement , five soldiers and interpreters were injured .
there were also three civilians who died in an incident in the city of Qarabaghi , according to local reports .
this bombing is the last of the acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in the Herati mosque attack on Tuesday .
on Monday two people were killed by suicide bombers near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul .
NATO &apos;s statement said that there was an explosion on Thursday evening , when the Afghan army of collective patrols was attacked with &apos; man @-@ made explosives &apos; .
according to the statement , everything has been injured in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital in Bagram airport .
according to Correspondents , the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic state , in Qarabagh , are a serious source of concern for the forces in Baghdad , NATO .
according to the UN , at least 1662 civilians have died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital city .
at the end of July , the car bomb in Kabul killed at least 30 people , mainly in the Shi &apos;ite line .
according to the Taliban , they were behind the attack .
on 31 May , more than 150 people were killed by a major bomb attack in the central city , which has led most to death by military attacks in the country since US @-@ led forces were reluctant by the Taliban in 2001 .
this violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , while the President of the United States , Donald Trump , is considering whether to increase the number of US troops assisting the country &apos;s military forces and the police .
according to respondents , the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public confidence crisis against the government , its policies and , in particular , President Ashraf Ghan .
EPA annulled the decision to postpone the regulation following sharks
the United States Environment Protection Agency ( United Nations Environmental Protection Agency ) annulled the decision to delay the adoption by Obama of a regulation obliging states to limit surous emissions , one day after 15 states referred the Agency to the courts on account of its conduct .
the EPA announced a decision to proceed late on Wednesday 2015 , saying that it demonstrates the Agency &apos;s commitment to cooperation with states .
&quot; we believe that we need to engage in dialogue with our national partners and listen to them , &quot; said Scott Pruitt , head of the EPA .
the Pruitt had announced in June the intention of the EPA to postpone the rates of ostility content in Peru , which measure pollution in the various parts of the country , in order to determine where this level should be reduced by one year in order to meet the highest air quality standard by one year by 2018 .
the 15 main democratic states , together with the Colombian community , submitted an action on Tuesday , saying that this decision is illegal .
President Donald Trumpi &apos;s government has attempted to draw back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama .
however , these efforts have led to reactions among the groups of democrats and nature conservation who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on people &apos;s health .
it says on the EPA website that the breathing of ozone @-@ containing air &apos; could lead to a reduction in the employability of Copts and an increase in the risk of suffering from respiratory diseases , such as asthma .
German cigarettes may have pipes .
German swine and pigs can come from pipes because heavy rain threatens the yields of the second largest wheat producer in the European Union , Banimal berg writes .
this year , it can be said that weeks before harvesting can mean that the fruit intended for the bread industry can only feed animals .
&quot; the quality of content is far worse than that of the bubble and worse than in 2015 , &quot; Agravis Raiffeen &apos;s analysis , Mr Bernhard Nepal , said .
this year , up to 40 % of German nicotine can go to animal feed , which has been fed compared to the usual one , in Agratis .
German farmers , like their European counterparts , have been exposed to any weather this year .
first of all , the winter was too dry .
then came the cold spring , which was replaced by heat waves in June .
in July , Germany was hit by the storm , which has continued in August .
many eyes have been placed on northern Germany , where the rain obstructs harvesting .
so far , only five per cent of nicotine has been repeated .
the majority in the region has not yet started harvesting , notified the local buyer of catches in Ceravis .
&apos;There are quite difficult days &apos; , Mr Frank Deckert Rendsburg , senior traders in Ceravis , said .
consistency in everything , that is to say , internal design of Finns
Caunis Nature plays a part in the internight of mesh homes , because , through big windows , Saimaa fishermen &apos;s measured views are reached in many rooms ( life ) .
at every step , our northern neighbours &apos; aspiration to create both harsher and perfect ( energy @-@ saving ) homes comes to an end .
the ability of Finns to use wood as construction and reconstruction materials , furniture and beauty is also worthy of deforestation .
Virgised techniques and smart solutions can be found both as a builder and ( home ) maker .
it highlights the fact that black , white and grey collections if they are supplemented by wood rapes and topipes can be very disturbing .
good ideas can take another week , because the air will run until 13 August .
suppliers and spices suggest that this kitchen is often copied .
the √ñ√∂l adopted today &apos;s footnote of Weekise Festival Balticen , and Martin Garrido did all he can to remember the last speaker .
the people were truly revolving at the time of Mr Simpson &apos;s speech - songs , songs of interest , tanks .
when lunch stopped , a common mastery of the Spanish city was dispersed .
we are bringing together the photographers that attempted our photographs for three days in the space of Weekise .
you will certainly also be some of them , look for yourselves !
M√ºry Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time , discuss possible confrontation .
Mr Vasyl Lomachenko and Mr Garcia , who are supposed to be on a collision course to face up to 66.7 kg in the boxing category for the near future , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in the office of ESPN in LOS Angeleres , up to Garcia , the unwinning World Boavian Council lightweight champion , walked out the other side of the corridor to welcome Lomachenkot , World Bo–µzationi sulgweight cheque .
following a unanimous decision by Garcia , both combatants belong to the top of the weight table on Saturday in ShowTime , the former four @-@ time world champion , Adrien Broner .
Garcia extended its hand better and said , &apos; How does the summer go , the champion ?
I wish you every success . &quot;
Mr Lomachenko is defending his belts against Miguel Marriga on Saturday evening at 19 ESPN .
when a couple of photos appeared , Lomachenko &apos;s m√§nejer , Eg Klimas , stated that there would be a &apos; perfect yardstick &apos; against combatants .
&quot; I am a former consultant , &quot; said Garcia .
&quot; I called for Bronger &#91; 63.5 kg &#93; , but I am not so big .
I am small for 63.5 kg .
I want to move downwards .
and he has to move up to half the lightweight &#91; 61.2 kg &#93; , and then we can fight .
games have called for this .
let us then help them to do so . &quot;
Lomachenko agreed .
&quot; the world needs this fight . &quot;
in the climate , the question raised was whether it should be worthwhile looking at it , which is part of his strategy to allow Lomachenkol to debate at the end of this year at 61.2 kg of class in order to make it possible next summer to meet with Garcia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 novans ) , which also has an interest in combating Jorge Linarese Linarese and Luke Campbelli &apos;s match winners following their lightweight at Forraut on 23 September .
&quot; looking at this fight could be worthwhile , as fans have called for this confrontation , &quot; said Garcia later , saying that he was open to fighting any channel offering the best financial packages .
&quot; we are key players .
no other name can attract so much attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Mrs Garcia said that she considers Lomachenkot a &apos; armed fighter &apos; , and that she could look to his Saturday &apos;s match .
however , Lomachenko was timid in praising Garcia by saying that , in his view , the three divisjon champions from Riverge saw &apos; very slow ; apologies , Mseley ... you wanted this nodistant &apos; .
according to Mrs Garcia , the aim was to show the strength of the blows and then boy .
both have confirmed that they feel that the tension is increasing in order to reach the challenge between them .
&quot; this is a fight that looks forward to realisation .
no other confrontation arouses so much attention and noise .
I am more than willing to work on this , &quot; said Garcia .
Lomachenko said : &apos; I have been waiting for the best fighters , and Maey is exactly that .
this will be a good fight . &quot;
what world pressures are being moved to Estonia ?
soil was extended and issued quarterly more than 13 000 residence permits by the police and border control authority ( PPA ) for third @-@ country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia to work , study or family .
when , for example , soil was decided to issue a fixed @-@ term residence permit of 6702 foreigners , Madagascar &apos;s number was 4928 .
the services cannot tell us how many migrants will end up permanently staying in Estonia , but such an analysis will be drawn up by the Ministry of the Interior .
ten years ago , nearly 500 Ukrainians sat in Estonia a year ago , this figure will be close to 2 000 in recent years .
during the crisis in Ukraine , the number of applications for renewal increased dramatically , with 1087 people receiving fixed @-@ term residence permits in 2014 , up from 675 in the previous year .
in Estonia , the highest number of Ukrainian citizens comes from the statistical authority , with 850 Ukrainian citizens arriving in Estonia in excess of their generosity .
&quot; the Ukrainian community has always been big in Estonia and , due to difficult circumstances in the country , it is natural that employment and learning opportunities should be sought from a country where the community and many families are already in front of the family . &quot; said Kristin Ramallah , spokeswoman at the Ministry of the Interior .
the number of Ukrainian citizens who had fixed @-@ term residence permits was even higher than that of Russian citizens , even though in 10 years the longest @-@ term residence permits have been issued .
when Ukrainians come to work mostly here , Russian citizens for family migration .
&quot; given the historic Russian community here , they are also more likely to have the greatest family ties with people living in Russia , &quot; said Helina Medal , an internal protection agency .
&apos;When you look at where the citizens of Russia who have been licensed by Estonia live , Harjumaa is immediately Eastern Virgland &apos; , he added and pointed out that about 40 % of them have been married with the citizens of the European Union .
soil was granted a fixed @-@ term residence permit of 1696 Russian citizens , which is also a record number .
at the same time , the number of Russians who wanted to extend their residence permits decreased .
&quot; compensation is the result that , instead of extending the residence permit , a new residence permit has been requested to settle permanently in Estonia , &quot; was explained by the press spokesperson at the Ministry of the Interior , Mr Ramallah , who said that the interest of Russian citizens in Estonian residence permits has remained rather stable for years .
a new residence permit for Estonia to reside permanently can apply to foreigners who have lived here for at least three years from the previous year .
its aim is to encourage the Silk @-@ up of people who have been adapted .
however , long @-@ term resident residence permits require five years , for example .
the extension of the old residence permit has obviously also decreased as a result of the new residence permit .
for example , soil was granted such a residence permit to 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years .
the Ukrainians will now be able to exchange their jobs , and the Estonian state will no longer stop pointing the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met .
this residence permit has become popular - applications are still made by holders of a grey passport ( 1029 ) , Russians ( 487 ) , Indians ( 54 ) and nigerans ( 36 ) .
a total of 1968 people , including 23 Americans , 12 Egyptians , 18 Georgians and just as many Chinese , were able to live in Estonia for entry .
with the first half of this year , the total number of such applications is already 1269 .
in 10 years , surprisingly , Nigeria has become one of the most active applicants for Estonian residency .
when , in 2007 , three residence permits were issued to Finns , soil was 200 .
Nigeria comes to learn from this university .
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular , for example , among Georgians , the Chinese and the Turks .
the number of citizens of India , Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen mostly thanks to learning games .
for them , too , there is the rule that , where a community has been set up , there will be others more easily , &quot; added Ramallah . &quot;
over ten years , two people in Estonia have also moved , for example , from North Korea , just as much from Laos and Madagascar .
ten people have come here from Cuba , 231 South Korea , 40 Indonesia and four Uruguay .
if around 6 000 third @-@ country nationals receive a residence permit a year , this is about 0.46 % of the total population .
even if you look at the citizens of the European Union , migration remains close to about a percentage , &quot; the mafia commented that the figures are actually small .
a total of 14 822 people emigrated to Estonia according to the statistics office , 13 792 .
this means that immigration transcends migration for a second year .
the majority of entrants and movements are Estonian citizens , but there are more of them among those who leave them .
that is why Estonian citizens &apos; migration mystery with 2 000 people was in decline .
Estonians in particular migrate between Finland and Estonia .
Mammu Couture Princssimde lures with sats , chickens and tarrogance .
there is , however , a history for Mrs Tammeoru - old paints and defendants : &apos; I can dream for hours somewhere in the museum and admire the thieves and crats of the old era .
if you take something with stone , you will study and learn from it on a daily basis .
it is a pleasure to find out .
the Arctic world of MMouture Couture has the potential to appear in some alien environments , but the designer does not think so .
you yourselves decide how much soul your life !
as a friend , as a whole , I have a sail full of the wounds that I have created , couture .
because nor is it his fault that he does not live in Hollywoos and does not go on a red whim every day ; he also wants to wear the most beautiful brokers and is suffering !
you will be able to live your own special life !
an artist does not recognise the gap between the breakaway events and the grey day .
it was this reasoning that put forward a plan to transfer high grade in Estonia to rural areas , between forests and fields , to people who often do not reach them .
for example , a joint collegitation was presented a long time ago , in comparison , in Jevening and in Perlo moealleel , where 45 mosques were filled by the Queen &apos;s defilee as a whole .
there is often a hang in the city of Tallinn , with dignity , but there is more emotion elsewhere - slogans , bbavo , stand up , want to thank you .
a large proportion of the audience had just had to be news , but now they are the fans of Mammu Couture .
if you overshoot people &apos;s expectations , they are spirited !
and I like the feeling that I am in my fashion like the summer .
incidentally , we had a 50 @-@ metre red red carpet , a whole street full of stickers , it seemed that they would not come to an end .
Mrs Ashton also does not recognise the fashionable practice that nature must be presented by a superimperialist superb , she will be happy to bring ordinary women .
I often call on my own customers - they have always been happy .
after all , it is so lax the experience , you find a wonderful piece on the temple stage !
I am so sorry that I have never seen that I have never seen my own play , I am always behind the ground in order to be able , as a hopeless Spaniard , to put a last piece of meat on things .
my nervous would not allow a calm sight of the Chamber .
it is this kind of motto , Mrs Maria Maria Maria who wants not only to play a representative role , but also to be involved in everything .
I have my sister in the core , and most of the collections are carried out by myself .
I like the whole process , where you play with details , to discover .
I am never far removed from my nature and I am not afraid of work .
it is not limited , but it is also a matter of injection , logistics , organisation , organisation - everything has to jump off the days of a woman of one temperment .
for these hours of work , the fanatics still have a huge amount of work .
I cannot say when my working day ends , for me it is just a happy day !
I am still very lucky - it is like unstoppable happiness : I do something beautiful , man gets something beautiful and , in turn , compliments .
it has been said several times that my brokers have a land grace - they make themselves feel printed .
the guerrilous , ultrullibery lines made by Mrs Ebadi known overnight have long since remained a signal from the Couture until now .
Martin Myrsep U18 boys : weapons of Estonians were now turned against us .
the damage , the fairy tale , ran out .
the first thing came to an end was that we could not get round our tables .
and when so much difference comes in the table , there is nothing to do , &quot; said Estonia U18 corvpallipos 61 : 75 drop @-@ out to Britain , our only basketball , BC Kalev / Cramo abitreener Martin Myrsep .
opponents took 28 requests from the south @-@ west , which led to so many more attacks .
we were also not prepared to protect them aggressively and not to attack them , which created it .
many of the attacks by the English people ended in three to five seconds , we were unable to build protection .
in defence , however , they were able to hold their hands somewhere , and we could not combine them .
it brought the team down its feet .
the work of the opponents was better done .
according to Myrsepa , Estonia would have had to make more tactical mistakes in order to wipe out the anti @-@ insurgency .
in the last quarter , we had a zero error , but opponents have already received a number of quick records .
Atlessness and density , which were our weapon at the alagropiturnir , all now turned against us .
today we did not have the power against their aggressiveness .
the Myrrhenp remained satisfied with his negligence in Kalevis , Matthias Tastery .
security in general can say good words about the whole team ; to date , there has been a united shock .
it is a pity that such an aggressive response had not already been met before .
Tass have always been self @-@ confident and played out today , but he seemed to have been tired - he has borne quite a heavy burden .
but he made some very nice gestures , which I have seen before in trendars , adding guidance .
horrendous figures : EM @-@ turnicotine was nominated for three quarters less than 10 ( ... ) .
U18 age classes do not apply only to the young men em B @-@ divisjon corvpallisigniir in Tallinn , she started in Dublin the day after yesterday .
and , unfortunately , Estonia &apos;s play with Poland lagged in the area of anti @-@ refrigerators .
Estonia lost 25 : 65 , but even after the third quarter , the situation was 9 : 49 , or only in the last 10 minutes , opponents took their feet from the gas beet and 16 were left : 16 .
in both the first and the second quarter , Estonia threw 4 , 3rd point ...
at the same time , in the first two minutes , the Estonians caught two pieces of the first few minutes , and then played by 25 pieces , then one yellow , and then another 21 tales .
perhaps in almost half an hour , one of the 47 fins was taboo .
in addition , 2 points came from the four looses .
there was a reasonable number of losses in this period of time , 12 .
at the end of the game , Poland had 33 and Estonia had 13 % ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has started with two losses , with 83 in Portugal having to be admitted on the opening day : 56 on the right .
NATO vessels came to Tallinn to complement supplies
today , for a week in Tallinn , NATO arrived at a permanent mine attack group for an initial port visit in order to supplement vessels &apos; stocks and prepare for prospective practices .
in the course of a visit , ships are preparing for landing on the sea , thereby giving crews the opportunity to holiday on a daily basis .
following the visit , NATO vessels will remain in the waters of Estonia in order to carry out a number of exercises and to be ready for future operations in search of historic exploits .
&quot; the participation of indigenous people in the NATO unit and the combined activities they carry out in local waters is a good illustration of our integration with the alliances , &quot; said the chief captain Arto Reinland , the overseas fleet Commander .
as of 29 June , NATO will chair the Latvian Navy capter , Gvido Laudups , a permanent group of landfilling officers from Estonia , Johan @-@ Elias Seljab , at a ceremony in Riga .
LVNS Virsaitis , a Latvian naval force , has been designated as the group &apos;s flagship port .
during this semester , the Estonian navial mine hunters are also part of an international unit .
as one of the four groups of vessels subject to NATO naval boards , NATO is a permanent group of primary responsiveness units that the Alliance can send to different parts of the world within five days .
4 . - To 13 August , the Pirita monastery will once again become a place in which Birgitta Festival , launched 13 years ago by Maestro Er Kans , will be held down .
this year , Mrs Festival , the capital city &apos;s artistic leader , Lyto Joosti ( 36 ) , will be beautiful , powerful and unprecedented .
&apos;Traviita &apos; and &apos; Tosca &apos; , balletilagic answers from Bolerost , Karlssonin , and there is also no shortage of own @-@ productions , this time Joseph Haydni &apos;s wonderful Orchestra , in 2015 .
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre replies .
it is higher than any music theatre in its usual form .
it is a festival that takes power and never gets rid of .
it is because the experience with which a listener receives in this superior and salvable environment puts humanity in a brighter way and concerns human beings in a way that cannot be described .
to the risk , you are the first year leader of Birgitta Festival art .
did the Maestro Eri Kbabies &apos; shoes not feel a little big ?
of course , but since I had a very personal relationship with Mr Klaus , there has been a lot of help .
he went through me all my student career and also supported the restoration at the start of the diametric career .
perhaps it is thanks to this that it will be easier for me to continue his work .
there has been so much charity in different Klas and , of course , all of this goes to me .
it was excellent to join a team who knows exactly how things are going on .
it was the great heart of Eri Kans , too , who gave me the power to make a good move forward with Birgitta Festival in Tallinn .
and here I am , and I can do it .
what about the audience at today &apos;s Festival , what are you offering in particular ?
we have artists from England , Latvia , Lithuania and surprise , among other things , the first baller written on Mrs Lindgreni .
this is &apos; Karlsson lb &apos; .
and there is a notorious nuance in this regard that the author of this ballel is the Latvian composer , Juris Karlinning , who himself expressed a wish to write it .
apparently , she has already had a carature of Karlsson , who has already lived in the heart of the child .
at the risk , how are you all tired of all this ?
thank you very much to my life @-@ sponsored colleague .
such work requires a system of support and a lot of love , and this is something that I am lucky to have .
and I have noticed that my personal emotion does not depend so much on other people as I do , that is , how do I oppose every new day ?
and such an awareness of maintaining the tone , maintaining the usefulness and , in fact , smiling ourselves into the mirror of the morning rose by a significant percentage of my happiness .
especially now this week , when there are the most important tests , I have been particularly keen on it and it is working .
to laugh oneself is hurting the brain and raising the tone .
that is simply not a word .
I think that people do not yet know half the things of their own body , which the universe offers them , but it is one of the things that everyone will discover slowly .
right now , this is an important moment .
is there also a hardship before the dirigend was taken ?
there is still a need to replace clothing with more comfort .
this is a small moment for ourselves .
in general terms , however , I do not have the opportunity to pump or make a little cool before the big event .
in fact , I even like to talk actively to people , even before they take dirigendium .
however , come all to Birgitta Festival , what is also to be detected here , not least for a big manager and a ballet friend .
see a stark video with the risk of Joostiga !
new results of tests for assessing the age of Swedish asylum seekers were published
the latest results of the tests show that more than 80 % of the constitution was assessed as older than 18 , but not all of them believe in the accuracy of the results .
the Swedish National Institute for Legal medicine ( Rasytspreferably inalvert ) started the tests earlier this year .
the tests were set up for a more accurate assessment of the age during the application of the asthma , following criticism by the Swedish Office for Migration ( IOM ) for failing to correctly determine the age of a number of allegedly juvenile refugees .
from March 2017 until mid @-@ 31 July 2017 , Tunisia has sent 680 cases of testing , and the Institute for medicine has issued a total of 2481 tests .
Eighty per cent ( 2002 ) was assessed for 18 @-@ year @-@ old or older cases , and in another 25 cases , the Institute for Legal medicine estimated that the test &apos; may be 18 @-@ year @-@ old or older &apos; .
in 432 cases , it came to the conclusion that the person is &apos; probably younger than 18 &apos; .
the tests will only be used if a person &apos;s age is questioned .
according to Johan G√∂ransson , who works in the Institute of judicial medicine , the results are consistent compared with those of previous months .
&quot; we do not see a big difference compared to the statistics of the past months ; the figures are quite consistent , &quot; he said to the newspaper The Local .
the fact that a large proportion of cases were assessed on average than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have been elected for their age .
the EIT issued the results of the 581 test in May and said that , in 442 cases , &apos; there are indications that the person examining is 18 years old or older &apos; .
however , when the newspaper Svensson ska Dagbladet investigated the results of their 581 tests , it became clear that , in 243 cases , a person had stated directly that he would receive 18 this year .
this medical age assessment method , in which fabull @-@ teeth r√∂ntgeniid images and exotic MRT are carried out , has been criticised by dental doctors and radiologists in some circles .
one of the sceptics is Arkrinologist Claude Marcus , the Karolinska Institute , whose task is to assess people &apos;s biological maturity in order to find out whether they went through audiences sooner or later .
&quot; I have had reason to think about this and I do not think that the method of measurements currently being used should be used .
the designation of biological age in this way is very precarious .
if we cannot safely say , then we should not pretend that we get , &apos; he said forestry to the newspaper .
however , Johan G√∂ransson of the Institute for medical medicine defended the accuracy of the tests : &apos; in general , it can be said that the risk of pumping the baby inadequately into adulthood is negligible .
the biggest risk , perhaps at around 10 % , would be if the person is just under 18 . &quot;
9 sign that you could forgive you for more expensive .
you paid you and spent a night with someone else .
the summer is painful , because you have so many nice times and memories together .
I would like to reassure him , but is it the right time ...
Your Tango lists nine signs , which show that the cost of your action is twofold and can be forgiven .
it seems more expensive to understand the seriousness of the situation and hard to deal with it .
more expensive treatment will be given to the problem that led him to a bed with a different compass .
you are no longer in a defensive position .
it sincerely regrets and takes responsibility for its actions .
he is not trying to blame you for your behaviour .
it agrees that it has made a serious mistake and is sincerely trying to improve the situation .
he is attentive and he is trying to communicate with you in a pleasant way .
at the same time , he is forcing you to get to grips .
they do not deny what has happened , nor are they trying to make it unnoticed .
it is all the more expensive for you to understand why there was a lack of loyalty to you .
you talk about this , and also about how to avoid it in the future .
you need to communicate better and assess each other &apos;s needs .
your more expensive attitude and action have helped you to develop our condolences against his mistake .
a more costly commitment and behaviour has created the basis for your proximity to return .
as a couple , you have made progress to believe once again in your unity and relationship .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old newer , Anna Maria Orel , made a beautiful debate in London , receiving 67.37 places of good 18 seats .
after that , MM noorim was a female jungle , and a happy woman confirmed that he hopes to fight for medals in the future .
the contest went well and had a good experience .
with the first test ( 64.80 ) , I immediately removed my average result , the second one ( 62.80 ) risk too much and the third one ( 67.37 ) I was able to keep it very clear . &quot;
I expected my emissions , and I am very pleased that I found it .
Anna Maria Oreli MM &apos;s debate ended in a good 18th place .
Vihmasadu Orelit did not mix , as he is , after all , training the winter through the TEC stage .
&apos;I am terrified &apos; , he said a little bit more .
the London Olympic Assembly had almost a full house of the people , did the people reconsider themselves , or were they able to turn off ?
Mr Tajani , but in a positive sense .
everyone says it will add - that is the case !
if you compete on your own , you can experience it .
he then confirmed that he will be satisfied with the MM debate and that he is still waiting for a lot of good competition : &apos; I came here with the 32nd outcome of this season , in other words the last one , ended in 18th place .
this is a very good result .
I am 20 years old and More - that is the only thing that counts .
I take good experience and , in some days , I want to compete on behalf of medals .
Western Virgina kuberner announced party change
the Western Virginia Democrat Governor , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening , together with President Trumpa , that he would change political parties .
&apos;Let it not , but the democrats walked away from me , &apos; said Governor Justice .
&quot; today , I say to you , having pushed a lot and thought for it ... today , I say to you , the Western peaches , that I can no longer help you as a democratic Governor . &quot;
explanations of joy were shed at the sitting .
&quot; so I will become Republican tomorrow , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a engineer , I would say to you that it is time to play another game . &quot;
the Trump had previously promised a major announcement at the gathering of Western Virginia .
Trucher won 42 points in Western Virginia and Justice did not support the candidate for democrats , Hillary Clinton .
justice , which , according to Forterai , is the only billion star of the state , proved to have been elected in 2016 .
Ford states that it has coal mines in five states , and the coal business quite from its own father .
its value is approximately USD 1.59 billion .
at the same time , the Republican National Committee ( RNC ) published an announcement on Thursday night that &apos; the party exchange of Governor Justice is yet another blow to the democratic party park , which would rather prevent the country from being improved again rather than working for it &apos; .
&apos;Over 15 months and controls over the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice &apos;s announcement is simply the most recent wake @-@ up call for parks that are out of the beginning and cannot find a positive and united message , &apos; said RNC representation Ronna McDaniel CS Newsi in his statement .
it is hardly surprising that , where there are many people , there are also many injured .
Ms Urmet , who is in office at the Weekise medical axis , told the girl yesterday that posters had had to be distributed quite a lot .
Grandes and brands are fundamental , excuses and easy failures .
of course , stalls , ruins and shoes .
according to Urmeti , visitors come to the festival with false footwear , and so there will be problems .
the media have also had to provide assistance to a couple of visitors with major injuries - there have been some scaremongering practices , and there have also been one footballs .
we have also made brothers when a person has pulled the hand or the finger .
let us do less nurses here ; let us send more to hospital .
look at the videos as to whether the brakes on the media for the treatment of potablet would also ask a painkiller .
Coe praised the Russians &apos; honest apologies for the Dingushall .
according to his words , &apos; Russia &apos;s honest apology from Thursday &apos; , the international rallied Sebastian Coe was praised , but repeated that now is not the time to allow the country to return to sport .
Dmitry Shycehtin , who entered into force at the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Cup , said that the competition ban imposed on his country is the right one and has a firm aim to combat doping .
he apologised for &apos; all kinds of lighters who have been burnt out in competitions by golden and silver medals &apos; .
in spite of his comments , the IAAF Congress voted in favour of keeping the ban on competition in force , which was introduced in November 2015 , after the World Anti @-@ Doping Agency ( WADA ) report found evidence of state @-@ sponsored doping in Russia .
&quot; in my opinion , today it was a very honest presentation , a very honest presentation , saying to the press the President of IAAF , Mr Costa .
&quot; the entire Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation itself recognised that they had had had rather difficult times and that they would do their utmost to reform the alunion . &quot;
according to Coe , he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for self @-@ anticipation .
&quot; I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is being made , but the Congress supports the proposal of the working group that now is not the right time to withdraw Russia , &quot; said Coe .
&quot; we must do everything possible over the next few months to normalise the situation .
we are always guided by the principle that we want to isolate clean sportsmen and sportspeople from the broken system , &quot; he added .
one of the hundreds of Russian frivolers who meet the strict criteria of IAAF are competing with the lighter entry into force in London on Friday as neutral athletes in the World Cup .
the head of the IAAF working group , Rune Andersson , said on Monday that Russia does not yet meet a number of rehabilitation criteria .
following a presentation to the IAAF Council , he told journalists in London that doping control is still insufficient and that lecturers banned are still operating freely .
the electric car revolution substantially changes the demand for metals .
who are the winners and losers ?
not only does the electric car revolution fundamentally change everything from the fuel market to infrastructure , but it also creates new winners and losers in the metal market .
although extragiants such as Glencore can say that they will win from one place to another , smaller mining firms will not help .
Glencore coal and oil currently serve , but , in the era of electric cars , cobalt , lithium , copper , aluminium and nicotine demand will continue to grow .
this year , governments in the United Kingdom , France and Norway have stepped up their contributions on the spread of electric cars to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades .
that is why Mr Volvo has already announced that he is planning to give up an internal combustion engine , and Tesla will bring to the market a cheaper Blue 3 electric car .
Banimal berg &apos;s New Energy Finance Facility estimates that over two decades electric cars will be sold more than those using oil @-@ fired fuels .
&quot; with regard to some metals , this will change everything , &quot; said Simona Gambranin Banimal .
we have already seen a huge impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium , which have been growing demand for years .
in electric cars there are approximately three times more copies than in conventional cars , Glencore declared .
even more answers are needed at charging stations , so Exane BNP Paris estimates that this will increase demand by around 5 % by 2025 .
the increase in demand for electric cars means additional demand for lithium , cobalt , graphite and manganans .
Glencore derives profits from copper price increases for electric cars and the fact that there is the world &apos;s largest cobaltier producer , predicted by the Jeffila Group .
according to this broker company , the winners of the winners of the Fbetreport @-@ McMoRan and first Quanma Minerconventions are the winners .
the market is reacting to a changing trend .
this year there has been a 70 % drop in the London metal exchange rate .
there was a 37 % increase in soil prices .
finally , 14 % this year , mainly as a result of economic growth .
Glencore shares rose by 20 % in London , having exceeded the price rise to the rival Rio Tlide Group , BHP Billitoni and Anglo Stream .
on the manufacturers &apos; side there are lead companies such as Recyhtx and Campine , who have to adapt to a new era .
the main end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ hand use of the Prince is the batteries supplying the start @-@ ups of cars with a diesel engine .
electric cars are used by liitiumines .
&quot; this is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found for other purposes that could overcome the fall in demand , &quot; said Michael Widmer , Governor of the Bank of America Merrill Lynch metal Market analysis .
there is still a lack of insight into the impact of the generous trend .
Plic is 17 % this year , which is the best metal in London among the main industrial metals .
investors will see problems for metal in the long term .
&quot; I am not sure it is so bad for lead , because cheap oil is keeping ordinary cars competitive , &quot; said Herwig Schmidt , a metal company Triland Metalia .
if lead demand falls , it will take place slowly .
that may be the case in about 10 years &apos; time .
up to now , however , stricter emission standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars , which are more frequent dependent on advanced lead @-@ based batteries , will be assessed by the international lead and by the investigative body .
heavy metals such as aluminium will be replaced by steel , as a lighter car will be able to drive less electricity .
this explains an additional 1.6 million tonnes of closed minimum demand between 2013 and 2016 .
it accounts for 2.7 % of the world &apos;s output of aluminium .
this trend is likely to grow , says Widmer .
Aluminium catches 13 % this year because the growing demand by car manufacturers has led to market shortages .
steel producers do not .
he is working with General Motors to use nanotechnology for the production of wonderful cars .
ArcelorMittal is also trying to develop a lighter meltdown from steel in order to oppose a minimum .
&apos;A strong steel should be the answer to this development &apos; said Exane BNP Paris &apos;s analysis , Sylvain Brunet .
we see some progress in Europe .
the end of the oil era can also result in suffering for plaice .
soil took about half of this precious metal diesel engine as a catalyst for cars , and was announced by the metal finer Johnson Matteries .
&quot; many of the raw materials , such as oil and plate , may not have high demand in the future , &quot; said Bernard Dahdah , Natix &apos;s raw materials analysis .
this does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important , but their importance will change within 15 years .
Plaatine manufacturers believe in the continued demand for diesel hybrid cars .
Marc Grynberg , leader of Uncore power , said that more hybrid cars will continue to be sold in 2025 .
in the 10 @-@ year perspective , Toyota Motors and Hymuni Motos have been developed on hydrogen @-@ based cars that depend on a poster in order to generate electricity from hydrogen .
until now , however , this technology has not yet legislated commercially .
&quot; the Diet appears to be a clear losers along the road to electric cars , &quot; said Exane BNP Paris from Brussels .
German car manufacturers received a major setback in July because the Stuttgart court banned the use of diesel in Mercedes @-@ Benz and Porsche &apos;s home city .
how the monetary rules for football affect Neyra &apos;s transition to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing rampant spending of football clubs in Europe do not prevent Neyra &apos;s world record transfer from the Spanish football club to the French club Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequence from UEFA , the governing body , which dominates the European game and which has the power to ban teams from taking part in the security of the prestigious League of Ministers , will wait until Saint @-@ GerMay for Paris .
the financial rules on fair play ( FFP ) , introduced by UEFA in 2011 , mean that the PSG will have to prove at some point that Neyra &apos;s switchover was financed without huge losses .
EUR 222 million were paid to Barcelona ( USD 262 million ) just because the Brazilians bought out of its contract , and Neyra &apos;s salary will reach tens of millions of dollars a year .
here there are some aspects of Neyra &apos;s transfer to the French club .
the PSG will undoubtedly be able to extract such money for the recruitment of Neyra and for inclusion of its stars in a cloak , given that the team is funded by a family governed by the Katar energy pipeline .
clubs have been allowed to spend a great deal on recruiting players , but they have to balance it with legal sources of income that enable them to come up with them in football .
FFFP formed the basis for Michel Platini following his election as UEFA in 2007 .
this former French player believed that clubs who are falling into debt in search of success are actually engaged in fraud and risk swamping if the banks or owners were to give up subsidies .
as of 2011 , FFP will focus on monitoring their losses instead of the debts of clubs .
this change means that the business model used by Roman Abramovich first used in 2003 in Chelsea - to buy a club with potential and then spend heavily to improve the team and create a global brand - is more difficult to implement .
during the current three @-@ year evaluation period of FFFP , which runs until 2018 , the clubs may bear up to EUR 30 million in losses .
and despite the fact that Mr Platini &apos;s successor , Alexander Ceferin , is still committed to blocking excessive spending in 2015 .
&quot; FFFP is certainly not dead and we will no doubt continue to strengthen these rules in the future , &quot; &quot; said last week The negotiator , Andrea Traverso , the UEFA @-@ s FFP Supervisor .
even though the PSG tadus Neyra for the overpurchase clause as one full payment , they will be able to allocate this amount for the purposes of accounting for the entire duration of the agreement .
Mrs Neymar concluded a five @-@ year agreement , so it will be possible to indicate a transitional fee of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years .
for the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , the PSG , together with Manchester Cityga belonging to Abu Dhabi , received the most severe penalties .
PSG was fined EUR 60 million ( USD 82 million at this point ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million , and the club called for the crew of the League of Meists to be limited to 21 players during the 2014 @-@ 2015 season instead of the usual 25 .
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to override the regulatory authorities by extorting their revenues through companies linked to owners of the club .
the Catar company may sponsor the PSG , but if the value of sponsorship is recognised as standard market rates , UEFA would not allow it to be counted as official income .
this was the case in 2014 , when UEFA decided that Qatar tourist Authority PSG &apos;s value had been excited .
it has been said that a certain part of Mrs Neyra &apos;s PSG service could come to KaInfrastructure through contributions from the Management Committee of the World Cup in 2022 .
however , the PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neyra could become a world championship and say that UEFA &apos;s regulatory authorities would be easily able to expose such a manoeuvre .
the penalties previously imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant with regard to any attempt to ignore the rules .
people familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed the transition pro @-@ actively with PSG @-@ Neyra .
they were talking to ETA on condition that their anonymity is guaranteed , as they are not allowed to discuss the situation of the PSG .
the latest reports show that over ‚Ç¨ 10 million worth of revenue during the 2015 @-@ 2016 season at around ‚Ç¨ 542.4 million .
data from the last financial year have not yet been published .
PSG hopes that the arrival of Neyra will have a positive impact on sponsorship transactions , trade and snus .
the club looks forward to an increase of at least 30 % in turnover in relation to the conclusion of the contract .
Spain too , having clearly upset the departure of one of the biggest football stars , sought to block Neyra &apos;s transition by saying that the PSG is in breach of the FP .
&quot; this is a clear case of &apos; financial doping &apos; with the club and with the state , &quot; said President Javier Tebas to the Spanish newspaper AS , referring to the fact that the PSG belongs mainly to Katarias .
Arsenal m√§nejer Ar≈£Wenger , whose club belongs to the American sports magnage , shares the view that the state finances the club .
&quot; this is the result of property rights , and it has completely changed the entire football landscape over the last 15 years , &quot; said Wenger on Thursday .
&quot; if the club belongs to the state , everything is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play , as the state may have other ways or other interests to represent such a major player . &quot;

fifty years ago today : the Orchopian storm in Estonia , which was knocking on houses and windows .
the Hurricane described as a century storm , which , on 6 and 7 August , caused serious damage , particularly to the West , Harjuria and the Black Sea .
during these days in the north @-@ west of Estonia , the wind was more than 30 mm / s .
in my old factory in Bavaria , I went from one map pub to the other to the other and had a hand in supporting them .
everything was blind and marvellous , just like the world stage .
Taamal already withdrew from houses , recalled in 2002 the old Mrs Linda Kurova hospital magazine Estonian nature in this interview .
Linda &apos;s husband saw his belongings collapsed .
however , what sort of support were you going to give in to your hands , where are you coming up against such a storm ?
Haapsalus Kalda , who lived on the streets , came down as a window , when the windows fleshed water . &quot;
the fact that the roads were full , and the cabin coverage of the railway station had been flying 20 to 30 metres , has seen Linda the majority of sharks just like next morning .
according to the local authorities , the cats behind the Paralepa were behind hope , some were completely lengths , some boys .
everyone saw it very frustrating , the storm went out of hundreds of old trees as radar and pragmatism like a war .
Western Viruland could not be particularly badly affected by August 1967 compared to Western Estonia , but the losses were high there , the Virumaa theatre written in 2007 .
Sharapsalu Lfossil Park and Padise Park were wiped out from the ground , but the parks of our chain were also severely affected .
in Tallinn , the wind was measured by up to 35 metres per second , or approximately 130 kilometres a hour .
in Tallinn , Meritteal , one of the few lead chambers had died on the evening of 6.August : &apos; mother , mother !
they are in the air and will no longer be signed ! &apos; , wrote Virumaa theatre .
in Viljandiland , the generation &apos;s natural building was destroyed so much during the storms that it was decided afterwards to dismantle it .
it was not opposed to the design of the T√ºr Empire , which was later not restored .
on 12 August 1957 , the newspaper Red Cross wrote that refurbishment of towns and cities and settlements is progressing slowly and that their vehicles are progressing slowly , and the population could be involved in cleaning work .
Grains were also severely affected in Turin , and the newspaper stated that &apos; party organisations must be an incentive and guidance both for corps and fertility corps &apos; .
Orkaans will be able to speak when average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m / s .
once again in Estonia , the bluefin tuna will last 2 November 1959 , when Ruhnul measurements the wind radiation 48 m m / s .
on the island of Vaindstory , a measure was broken , so it was not able to record exactly the strength of the wind that was measured there .
secret of holiday beaches : night harvesting and poor coastal waters
younger summer festivals will also mean smaller corps in the beaches of Tallinn .
&quot; if there is no , people are on the ground , and if there are no people , then there will be no people &apos; , the quaestor will be recognised .
Stroom , the city of Northern Tallinn , is being torn up by rocks .
they are offered fantastic competition on low turns of competition by a piglet that drives down the platitudes .
in fact , the last seven centimetres of gross rubbish is blowing out of it through seafood and people left behind : insects , cigarettes and so on .
people are still coming to ransom , regardless of whether the water is warm or not .
if there is a beauty , then people are on the ground and , if not , there are no people too , &apos; the management of the Private Company Haabersti is said by Alexander Usov , the head of cleaning works .
it is 6.30 p.m. , and there is a bitter corps on the coast , because at 8 o &apos;clock a poster must be in order for the people .
Usov is already at four o &apos;clock .
in addition to Stroom , he is still keeping an eye on the coast of Pirita , Harta Lake , Kakum√§e and Palaraare Pikakari .
landfill amounts have fallen .
years ago , there was much more .
people can now already assess what is being done for them , &apos; Usov is talking about who has corrupted migrants for 15 years .
it was the case that , when something new had been stood up , it was already over the next day .
now , what is on the coast is already being held .
clean coast price
one of the biggest jobs on Estonia &apos;s beaches is the repetition of the rubbish , the adru .
for example , it has to be transported 400 000 tonnes on the coast of Pirita .
&apos;This is an incredible amount &apos; , marks Usov .
the second major category is municipal rubbish , that is to say , all that people are leaving behind .
one and a half kilometres offshore in Stroom have eight large rubbish lines that need to be scrapped three times a week .
so much will come from rubbish .
however , cold summer tables have meant that rubbish is one fifth less than otherwise .
the third species comprise abandoned things .
in most cases , they are children &apos;s televisions .
this time , the Usov Empire has pulled out of the sand ten metres of sludge .
they leave owners waiting for a floating wood route .
&quot; they usually come out more , but it is a normal harvest . &quot;
children come to rank and take toys in order to bury them back into the sand .
landfill is broken down .
Erika Scholler , a representative of administrative services , has admitted that a tractor &apos;s screening work is disrupted by local authorities .
noise , which lasts from night to hour , is mixed up by people living in the neighbourhood .
on the day , however , this work is impossible .
in one month , rand will have to travel twice .
&quot; if we do not do so , we will be fined by the city , &quot; Scholler will mark .
however , like Pirita , Pikkar and Savary , the aim is also to get Stroom rand below the quality of the international flag .
&quot; compared to Europe , there is much more work in Estonia to care for beaches , &quot; says Scholler .
we have more adples and more kids and it is more difficult for a friend to join .
however , there is less rubbish in our beaches than elsewhere in Europe .
when I hear that there is talk of rubbish , the conversations between Mr Martin , who is living near Stroom &apos;s beaches , are taken inexorably by a journalist and corrogation staff , pointing out the current bottlenecks .
there is a picture of the moon everywhere in the gallery .
there is a problem with birds and bottomless slaves who have hijacked rubbish bags , &quot; said Martin .
although it is difficult to assume that people are able to change their behaviour so far , Martin hopes that the urban government will do something with rubbish slogans and , for example , put them on the roofs , in order to prevent at least birds going on there .
in general , however , Martin Stroom is satisfied with developments .
we can see that the city takes care of this .
it has become more pleasant with baby walkers , enlightened and fresh asphalt roads .
at one time it was the case that only one route could be taken in instant cases , &quot; says Martin .
findings of Stroomis : coins , only coins
twenty @-@ seven @-@ year @-@ old Dimitri , who , as a armier heating , is sailing along the coastline with metallic depression , has had to be exploited as a measure of tomorrow &apos;s size .
he does not believe that , today and in the future , he will find anything valuable .
sea angles are not generous enough to do so .
&quot; I have been dealing with this for one year , and so far nothing worthwhile , &quot; says Dmitry .
as a refrigeration , in Dmitry , there are some euro coins , bottles and also dangerous pounds which later dumped in the rubbish .
normally , there are still coins .
&quot; culture , the finger and so on are usually not the case , &quot; they are owned by the armies .
Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain on the previous level , as unfettered economic growth and the easing of inflation have cushioned speculation in relation to the increase .
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain a loophole , as household incomes have put interest rates on hold .
decision makers of the Bank &apos;s Financial Policy Committee ( MPC ) have voted 6 : 2 in favour of 0.25 % retention and fewer members this month are calling for an increase , as slow growth has weakened support for growth .
in its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast from 1.7 % in 2017 to 1.6 % in 2018 and warned that the pressure on household incomes would remain , as inflation is still expected close to 3 % in the autumn .
at the same time , however , the Bank also signalled that the increase in rates is necessary to contain inflation from Brexon over the next few years , and the expected increase in lending costs on the financial markets may be necessary .
Members also voted in favour of the partial withdrawal of the mammoth package , which was launched a year ago as a result of Brexti .
in February , the Bank will terminate its fixed @-@ term cash scheme , which provides banks with cheap funding , even though it said that it is now up to GBP 15 billion more to be offered under this scheme , which is GBP 115 billion .
in the minutes of the decision on the rate , the Bank says : &apos; in the central forecast of MPC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) will remain powerless in the near future , since the difficult situation of real household incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption &apos; .
as regards the rates , it was reiterated that , in order to mitigate inflation , a &apos; fiscal effort &apos; was needed , to a somewhat greater extent than expected in the markets .
Eurostars is currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020 .
however , the Bank stressed that any benefit is gradual and limited .
the Bank &apos;s reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the forecasts in May .
the forecast of 1.8 % growth in 2018 remained unchanged .
after this news , the pound went down against the dollar and the euro .
women fell by 0.5 % to USD 1.31 and 0.4 % to EUR 1.11 .
the decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointing growth figures , which have led to an increase in expectations concerning the increase in GDP in Cotonou , from 0.2 % to 0.3 % in the second quarter .
the Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although at the end of the year it is starting to boost a little .
the Bank &apos;s latest inflation report gave little reason to rejoice households with rising inflation and pitiful wage increases , saying that the situation would go a little worse before improvements were made .
it has been added that the monetary policy cannot prevent a fall in income in the next few years , but a significant recovery is expected towards the end of the three @-@ year forecast .
thanks to the noble pound , the growing demand for British produce is also an incentive for the economy , partly compensating consumers for lower costs .
the decision will come one year after the 0.25 % in August last year , after the shocking EU referendum , which led to a sudden weakening of the pound .
according to the Bank , it is likely that it will take four years for prices and the economy to be completely revived .
prior to the Bank &apos;s last decision , there was a feeling of increasing demand because inflation had increased pressure on households ; in July , three policy makers called for an increase of 0.5 % .
inflation fell by 2.6 % last month , compared to 2.9 % in June , even though the Bank &apos;s message was expected , and in the coming months there will be an increase again .
the Bank said that excessive growth compared to the 2 % target was caused by a completely weak pound .
Andrew Montlake , leader of Coreco mortgages , said : &apos; in the light of the recent downturn in exchange rates , the mortgage market appears to be becoming increasingly competitive once again , as borrowers want work and hope to finish the year in a positive way .
Eurostars seems to be particularly favourable for those whose current transactions are coming to an end , as refinancing , often without service and low rates , has become increasingly popular . &quot;
NHS writing 10 000 people out of conflict with HIV medication
patients will have access , from September onwards , to &apos; transformative treatment &apos; for HIV prevention after the battle in the Supreme Court over whether or not the NHS should finance the medicine .
NHS England announced that public health is now expected to make it available to 10 000 people during an initial three @-@ year clinical attempt to contact pre @-@ emptively ( PrEP ) - a tablet that is manned prior to the interim procedure and has shown a approximately 86 % reduction in the risk of infection for high @-@ risk people .
the NHS agreed to finance a clinical attempt after last year &apos;s ruling by the Court of appeal that the NHS would be able to pay for PrEP , despite its own assertions that the drug should be financed by local authorities .
the Executive Director of NHS England , Simon Ste186 , welcomed this on Thursday as a &apos; sweeping intervention &apos; , while the National AIDS Fund ( NAT ) described it as a &apos; momentous moment &apos; .
sex health clinics in London , Bright ton , Manchester , Liverpoolis and Sheffiels are among the first to register people , and further clinics will be added in October , before the programme is introduced anywhere in England by April 2018 .
&apos;PrEP &apos; is a hotline for HIV drugs that will be taken before the incident in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV among people at risk of infection .
PrEP prior to taking action means that there are a sufficient number of certain medicines in the body that prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can take place on a daily basis or at the latest two hours prior to an interim procedure .
the right candidates include LGBT men , transgender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and do not receive treatment .
they identify suitable people who are willing to participate in clinical trials , including men , women , transgender people and those whose HIV @-@ related partner cannot receive antiretroviral treatment .
people who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will also be able to register their willingness to participate in the local sex health clinics which participate in the programme .
the programme costs GBP 10 million , and NHS England signed the contract to get medicines this week after the international procurement procedure .
the clinical test aims to assess the true potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence of who is treated and how it is consumed and implemented in a large cloud .
Ste186 said : &apos; this new wide @-@ ranging intervention should complement and enhance a comprehensive and increasingly successful fight against HIV .
this is yet another milestone for more than three decades in the fight against one of mankind &apos;s biggest health problems . &quot;
Deborah gold , Chief Executive of NAT , said : &apos; this is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV .
the PrEP , if properly targeted at those who need it and are at risk level , offers an opportunity to change the British HIV epidemic .
since September , people with a high HIV risk in England have had access to a powerful new tool financed by the NHS , which is individually managed and does not depend on the negotiations with the partner , thereby improving many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
ian Green , Executive Director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation , said : &apos; it is now essential to ensure that a clinical trial is launched quickly on the part of the country and that none of the members of the HIV risk group are excluded .
now that the PrEP clinical trial has been received , we are on the way to protect more than 10 000 people who are at risk of being infected with HIV .
Minister for Public Health , Sharon Hodgson , said : &apos; the beginning of the PrEP clinical trial is a very welcome and long overdue one , after months of delay and the census of government shoes .
evidence shows how much change this drug can bring to HIV prevention and end the spread of this life @-@ changing infection .
this clinical attempt will lead us a step closer to a complete understanding of the benefits of PrEP .
it is now important that a clinical trial is carried out as soon as possible in order to protect people who have contact with HIV and bring us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
electricity prices rose by 12 % in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
the difference between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania in electricity prices for the next day decreased to EUR 1.94 compared with EUR 7.71 in June this year , Elering .
the main cause of the price gap is the wealth of the Lithuanian @-@ Swedish Community .
in Estonia last month , the average electricity exchange rate amounted to EUR 34.33 per megavage hour and the price rose by 12 % compared to June .
in Latvia and Lithuania the price fell by five per cent to EUR 36.27 per megawatt hour .
in Finland , the price was EUR 34.17 , while the electricity exchange rate was EUR 26.37 per megavage hour .
prices rose by 12 and 7 % respectively .
between Estonia and Finland , electricity moved from 75 % last month to Estonia and 16 % from Estonia to Finland .
the other nine per cent of transactions between the two countries did not take place for the next day .
between Estonia and Latvia , electricity moved from Estonia to Latvia at 99 % , and 73 % of hours had full transmission capacity .
according to transactions in the Nasdaq OMX market on July &apos;s latest trading day , in August the electricity exchange price could reach approximately EUR 34 and EUR 37 per megavage hour .
the carbon price affecting the price of electricity production came up last month and transactions took place between EUR 5.04 and EUR 5.47 per tonne .
living in higher life - In a quasi and smart designers , it has become home to the small Earls Court of Justice .
Joanne Leigh , a former banker who is a passionate property innovator , changed his home of Knightsbridge in 2014 against the Earls Court .
this is in the first order of Queen Anne Ter≈£i , and the fact that Joanne has not brought his bags together and sold the flats is a tribute to the new design .
&quot; prior to that , together with a former compass in Knightsbridge , I lived on a much larger scale , &quot; said Joanne .
&quot; I chose something that would be tantamount to the price that I have offered .
I was shown by the Earls Court of Justice , which had the same high waves .
I knew about it , and I made an offer on the same day . &quot;
since the first visit , the 93 @-@ metre corps have gone through a complete wave of innovation .
at the beginning , it was a sleeping cort and a difficult sticking plaster - it had to walk through kitchen in order to arrive at a sleeping pipe ; Joanne wanted to add savings and quasi @-@ regulation in order to take advantage of the high mountains .
&quot; I wanted high , big windows , a lot of light .
these were my demands , &apos; he said .
he appealed to Erfan Azad Notting , the architectural and designer session Duck &amp; Order , to take advantage of the 3.8 m deserts and create a home that is not just a development site , but a place where Joanne can live .
it was not high enough to add two spaces to each other , so the architectural challenge was to create a quasi @-@ order in which to stand up .
the Erfan had to take a creative approach .
&quot; aquaculture is rather complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to reorganise the premises so that they were located on one another , without having to boast .
it was not just about building a platform , but using steel design so that it is right that both the upper and lower space . &quot;
this emphasis allowed Mr Erfans to create , in the room , two flambles with complete arrogance with a lot of dramatic elements .
one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ one @-@ size @-@ fits @-@ all will be opened with lighting on the Retrouvius window for glaciers under the sun .
the golden furniture , silver details and retropacilian Serge Mouille &apos;s light underline the style of space .
the use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of communications , space and traffic lights .
in both the short corridors , mirrors have been included so that it appears longer .
in Knight , the mirror is giving the impression of the second window , which opens up .
in the course of its activity , the census provides a reflection of the deposit for all the eating disorders and glass requirements of Joanne .
housing is accompanied by a false opportunity to close the vegetables if it is not used , creating an image of a smarter space .
cumulative kitchen is nothing new .
however , with this kitchen , what is unique is the fact that it is a plug of uprisings of garage .
&quot; it did a little bit of design , &quot; explained by Erfan terastronomy from MDF .
&quot; this has a counterweight , which is why it is very easy to put up with it . &quot;
thanks to the smart use of space and reservoirs , Joanne now has 16 additional square meters , additional sleeping rooms and a better harvester plan .
after all , what you sell - or what adds value to property - is &apos; Erfan .
&apos;Kinnismineral land kler takes an outdated form of tup and makes calculations on the basis of an underground area &apos; .
here , they have been able to increase surgery , using high @-@ quality materials that add luxury to space .
&quot; the materials are what you are dealing with and thus help to create emotional links with your homes , &quot; says Erfan .
&quot; you do not love the electricity cables in my sein .
it is important , but it does not put heart languages ringing . &quot;
this shows that a good design and an increased surface area help to do something astonishing from a rather normal corps .
in fact , they can even create a desire not to leave , as was the case with Joanne .
the chief figure , Jensen , is Chicago , a petroman in a pilot night who is competing with a fellow Member because of professionalism .
no more than the amount of money that has been earned , apart from which any ethics is forgotten .
his wife and her three children can only see a man on property and late in the evening .
in the first part of the film , I find myself in the idea that this is a version of the business world - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler .
however , what the film goes on , the less clerical element remains , and the moralising intention of filmmakers is beginning to appear more and more .
life @-@ changing experience leads to cancer for the main contractor .
a choice must now be made between work and family life .
the poet dreaming the father &apos;s feet at the Chicago Large buildings to think about matters of real importance such as religion , charity , love ... without even mentioning the disaster of the twin sectors .
after the third body in which the poet &apos;s father &apos;s eyes are opened , there is a feeling that film @-@ makers will certainly be exposed to the target , because even the most stubborn spectator will not be able to hold back tears when they see the suffering of the cule cancer patients .
if the poet falls into the House and his situation seems to be almost hopeless , the father will once and for all understand the morality of his work and do a good job for the elderly .
now , in my own sense , if the film has its own destination , then I would reward my vision after the film coffee , if I am wrong , then it could be praised for at least one surprise .
for a moment , there is a suspicion that the ice coffee will be lost - when the husband handles a sick person and a man drives a sickery along a motorway .
however , Poeg has been amazing , and although his father has just lost his job , it is even positive , because now it is time to deal with the family .
I , too , can feel very well - I can predict the end of the American drama quite well .
in truth , film is well constructed , with all the elements required to do so .
there will be a Council , there will be laughing , illustrators will be a good and moral beauty : money is not the most important thing in life .
this film is well introduced by surprise .
the new Staff Commander is planning to limit President @-@ in @-@ Office media consumption .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly will actually be able to deal with it .
in that case , it would be the first .
Mr Politico writes that the new staff chief of the White House intends to limit the flow of information from President Trumpin , including news , in the hope that it will keep the excess in a more balanced way .
here there is a full report from Josh Dawseyan :
&quot; when John F. Kelly met with senior officials on his first day of work , the White House revealed a key problem with President Donald Trumpi Valges Main , which he plans to solve the poor flow of information into President Assad &apos;s hands .
Mr Kelly told the officials that the information had to pass through him , either on paper or at meetings , because the President would make better decisions if he was given good information . &quot;
Mr Kelly &apos;s diagnosis seems perfectly logical , but others have also tried to do so and have failed to tame Trumpi by monitoring its use of the media .
President Trumpi &apos;s relationship with television dates back decades and , even now that he is in White Main , his television observation habits have not gone anywhere .
&apos;When the candidate Trump was annoyed for dishonest media coverage , to show him that he was also fairly reflected in the statements affecting him , &apos; said Sam Nunberg to Politicos in February .
Politico tara Palmer wrote at the time that , according to the six former campaigners , Trumpi Twitter is a key factor in the management of ter @-@ habits , to ensure that her individual media consumption is also accompanied by declarations of assurance .
OK .
however , the idea that Trumpi Twitter &apos;s habits have ever been &apos; controlled &apos; is ridiculous .
perhaps those campaigners will know something that the rest of us do not know that the Trumpi tag would have been even more heartening without these interventions .
we will probably never be able to know about shuttles that the Trump did not announce .
if he was helpless able to save him a few times a few times , his efforts were worth doing so .
no one , however , has been able to prevent Trumpi from constantly creating polemics .
part of the problem is that in the White House , which consists of competing tactics between them , people are trying , without exception , to promote their own interests by transferring material to the Truel , which supports their world views , but may not always be reliable .
in May , Politico , which reflects the whole course of the story , writes the reluctance of the advisers to inform the President of a strategic interest in feed .
one of the examples described by the reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows :
&quot; the current and former Trumpi submits that Trump can react to the negative press , with a particularly damaging impact on leaflets , in an explosive manner , taking as a obsession the identification of their source of origin .
this was also the case at the end of February , when someone discredibly gave the President a copy of the Internet provocation , Charles C. GotNews.com , a website belonging to Johnson , which accused the deputor Katie Walshi of being a white house &apos; source of multiple leaflets &apos; .
it goes without saying that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter , or that he did not provide any concrete evidence , or that he has also presented and withdrawn false accusations in the past .
the Trump read the article and started to ask for the subject of Wales . &quot;
Goldmacher added that Rob Porter , the then senior Staff Commander Reince Priebus and head of the White House , had attempted to set up a system for the management and documentation of documents reaching Trumpin . &quot;
how did it succeed ?
Mr Kelly is trying to do exactly the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader , but the Trump is still an impulse , and his assistant will still compete for influence .
these irrevocable factors make Mr Kelly &apos;s mission very difficult .
street musicians coming from abroad will not be able to obtain a bitter address .
there are many foreigners in the city of Tallinn .
those with whom the girl came to the fire acknowledged that he was playing in the elderly without the permission of the municipal government .
we first found three street musicians along Viru &apos;s gates , who had involved the same number of Koreans .
it was clear to see that musicians with rubbergs and broken hardliners were absensors who would have to spend one du≈° martyrs on .
in spite of the humiliation , the only woman in the company played a trail in the acordiation , while one man , alongside him , called him three Palliations and brought furnides closer .
the third man had sat alongside them on one of the dogs and smoked the craftsmanship of the farce himself .
their three chambers did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the people who were passing .
Mr Bob , who has played with Mr Noemi and the palliates , said that he was wearing on the streets both for fun and for money .
the purpose of the event was to collect tickets for a ship travelling to Finland on the same day .
with regard to the question of whether or not they asked for permission from the city for rotation , Noemi and Bob were shaking their heads .
firstly , we did not know .
secondly , we will never stay in one city for more than a day or a few days , and in most cases they will be granted for a month or so .
it makes no sense to pay for this , &quot; explained by Bob .
when we came back to the gates of Viru some 20 minutes later , we saw that two women are in the hands of musicians and are driving them away .
it paved with sacks and bags in absentia to come to grips with the Viru crossing of the Centre .
there were also three Polish young men present on Viru street , one of whom played a fifth , the other knife , and the third had even contributed to electronic glass .
&quot; we are here to offer people entertainment in order to spread music and joy , and to earn money for fuel and life , the trio of the pipe Mivosh explained .
according to Mivoshi , they are aware that there must be permission from the City Government .
&quot; of course we do not have it , &quot; he said it joke .
but we hope that , when people enjoy our music , there will be no problem .
of course , if the police comes , then we go elsewhere , but you have to try &apos; , he added .
the Estonian bank bought bonds worth EUR 149 million under the Public Private Company Programme of Central Banks in the euro area in July , and the Central Bank &apos;s bond portfolio increased to a total of EUR 4.36 billion .
the Central Bank does not provide more detailed information on purchases .
Estonian bank President Hardo Hansson has made it clear in the past that the central bank buy @-@ up scheme for the euro system will cover three different purchasing programmes : covered bonds for the financial sector ( VIS ) , asset @-@ backed bonds ( ABS ) and public debt ( PSPP ) .
the Central Bank will buy bonds from the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere .
the impact of purchases reduces the production of lower @-@ risk assets and encourages investors to take greater risks .
as a general rule , in the framework of the public sector bond exchange programme , each central bank buys its own government bonds , and the bonds of other countries are not purchased .
as the Estonian state has not issued bonds , the Estonian bank is making so @-@ called &apos; replacement purchases &apos; within the amount allocated to them .
Central Banks will also shop in those countries where the offer of bonds under the purchase scheme is limited .
the Estonian bank generally buys the bonds of the European institutions , such as the European Financial Stability Facility ( EFSF ) and the European Investment Bank bonds , confirmed by Hansson .
the Estonian bank will purchase bonds under the asset exchange programme as of March 2015 .
in the meantime , NTBs were also procured , but in June 2016 the Estonian bank was no longer able to buy mail bonds .
on behalf of the central banks in the euro area , the Finnish Central Bank buys both Eleround and Estonia &apos;s energy bonds from June .
emigrants ignore degrees and return to a &apos; millionset of millions &apos;
some of the West Midlands &apos;s most affluent home owners have once again found themselves in fierce confrontation with determined migrants who have ignored the unelected bureaucracies of the county council in order to win back their walls away from them .
migrants have refined their 20 trailers on the brink of a wealth of millions of business in the vicinity of the Sohatulli street .
they have returned together with the army of horses , children and lorries , after they were blowing out there only in May , without putting themselves in the mess of the bureaucracies cumbersome to block their invasion by the Council .
an activist group found a weak place in the limits of protection , turning its vehicles through an unstoppable part that had been left to football .
Maruangy residents have skirted at the Sopigulli Council , saying that the Council is &apos; useless to deal with the problem &apos; .
a anonymous person said : &apos; they copied there on Monday evening after they were expelled from Bentley Heathy , where they refused to stoning .
the Council must be ashamed to act because they are useless in dealing with the problem .
the migrants were there in May , they were delayed , and now they are back again .
they came to more yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot;
he added : &apos; Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such matters by obtaining long barriers to protect his parks .
I live on the road of street etsbrook , and I am not happy that I must continue to pay a mandate if the Council is unable even to block such a thing . &quot;
a local resident who also wanted to be anonymous also said : &apos; it is ridiculous ; we have only seen the latter leave these travellers , and there is already a new offensive .
this time , there has been an increase in the number , and even a horse has been seen in the grassland . &quot;
representative of the Someat City Council said : &apos; we are aware that there are unacceptable camps in the land near the street etsbrook road , and we are working with the Sooneulli police ; we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible .
the gathering of evidence will be very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by phone number 101 .
this will help create a picture of the situation for the court if we present the case to them . &quot;
the Weekna Festival will , among other things , visit the Minister for Culture , Indrek Saar , who is pleased to have been able to bring real world top names to Estonia .
the question of why it is so important for the Estonians at the Weekise Festival is Saar that it should be asked of all those who enjoy three days at the Festival .
however , he will admit that there have been real players in the area of Persia .
&apos;When you look at the level of the artists that we have been able to bring to Estonia , the absolute top names of this music director will be brought home - this is often not the case in our book &apos; , the Minister for Culture will speak .
which festival , however , are the artists who speak the most about Saart itself ?
I consider myself to be relatively old people , and it is certainly one of the most experienced doctors , Armin van Bnewren , who stood up last night .
after all , according to his poster , all of us , at some point , have complicated our own feet . &quot;
however , he also highlights a number of names , such as Chainester , Deadmau5 , Knifebels .
of course , our own Estonian players too : starting from NO≈£P , they can be read in a whole series .
in reality , this concentration of well @-@ known names is very high , &quot; he says .

Audi upgrades up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the light of criticism by car manufacturers .
a day before the Audi announcement , BMW said that it provides software for more than 350 000 vehicles .
according to the Chairman of BMW , the company believes that &apos; there are smarter alternatives than driving restrictions &apos; , referring to European cities , including the BMW home city of Munich , which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday an update to reduce emissions from diesel engines by three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe .
none of the companies described these practices as &apos; provocation &apos; .
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions .
however , nitrogen oxide emitted from diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and may cause asthma .
at the same time , equipment installed to neutralise emissions from diesel vehicles will increase the cost of diesel vehicles , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
while German car manufacturers are under an in @-@ depth investigation , Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s government is also accused of ringing powerful car manufacturers and of ignoring the signs referring to the problem .
companies are trying to prevent Volkswagen from repeating its faults , who were silent about the use of so @-@ called petroleum devices , which made it possible to adapt exhaust fares to regulations when testing a car , but returned to normal driving conditions .
a number of Volkswagen heads have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic .
in Germany last month , the former head of the Audi engine Development unit was arrested .
former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may be brought to justice in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi in Germany went into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen when the authorities accused of installing the Audit System in order to circumvent the requirements of Europe &apos;s emissions volumes , thereby extending the investigation , which had previously focused on the United States .
the inclusion of the Audi in the investigation may be a major blow to the Volkswagen , a producer of Luxembourluxury cars , disproportionately generating the profits of a large proportion of Volkswagen .
Estonian schools will receive 20 000 euro of European Union flags .
by 1 September , the Ministry of Education intends to buy EU flags for Estonian schools to mark the Presidency .
a total of 105x158 centimetres of the European Union &apos;s flag will be 570 education institutions .
Lips are intended to invest in indoors ; they must also be carried out in high @-@ quality printed indoors with a sense of attestation ; the ERR news portal will be facilitated .
on the label , there is a text : &apos; Kingitus to Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union .
the estimated cost of 570 flags lies at EUR 20 000 in the Ministry of Education , a flag costing EUR 35 .
murder of journalist highlights growing threats in Mexico
the workers of the weekly newspaper , Riodoce , usually gather on Wednesday in order to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the state of Blue authorisation , sowed by organised crime , corrupt officials and unstoppable drug wars .
today , however , they have gathered in the shadow of their personal tragedy to discuss their own security .
they are told that it is important to change their ruins .
two parents &apos; writers will be discussing which looks safer : whether to bring children to their office , which was the target of the granche attack in 2009 , or leave them home .
security experts have written three words to the leader of the room : &apos; enemies &apos; , &apos; neutrality &apos; , &apos; allies &apos; .
they are asking reporters to give the names of a veil in every piece of water not to provide evidence in theory , suffices on impressions and inner feelings .
the presence of government or cartels is suspected of being drug traffickers , politicians , businessmen and journalists alike , of having a full list of couples who make it dangerous to reflect the chaos that exists in Mexico .
violence is not a stunt , and the more dead people across the country accumulate , the majority of which is made up of journalists from Yemen , according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists , since the resignation of President Enrique Pena ≈ûto at least 25 in December 2012 . 589 journalists have been under public protection following attacks and threats , and this year at least seven journalists have still died in seven countries .
the most recent deaths include their editor and source of inspiration , Javier Valdez Cardenas , co @-@ founder of Riodoce .
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; Valdez wrote in one of his many reports on drug @-@ related violence .
his absence makes a deep sense , even though his presence can be felt everywhere on the Asian Riodoce Building , a big picture of Valdez , which shows an average clip , with a letter entitled &apos; Justice &apos; , and two of the 30nines reporters , Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez , carries T @-@ shirts , which have been portrayed by his wife @-@ private glasses , or the face of his petroleum .
the meeting will take place less than two months after his death , and pasters will discuss common trauma , their nightmare , their hopelessness , their paranoia .
in 2010 , although a separate public prosecution service was set up to deal with journalists &apos; cases , only two cases have been prosecuted by the Committee for the Protection of journalists .
like most of the annual drug trafficking and organised crime @-@ related murders , which amount to thousands , the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .
Riodoce &apos;s editorial action continues to reflect the violence in Sinaloa , even though their hearts have been broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous .
without the data and justice of murderers , the security meeting Ibarra says that there will be a great deal of use .
&quot; it is very nice to waste your time here at the meeting , &quot; he says .
&quot; as long as the reason is not known , everyone will be trusted . &quot;
Valdez left the office of Riodoce in the capital of the State , Culiacan , on 15 May morning .
he was able to travel just a few quarters before two men stopped his red Toyota Corolla , forcing him to exit the car and shot him 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper , meaning in translation the &apos; twelfth river &apos; .
an armed man was travelling to Valdez in the car and made an accident close to that .
Valdez was 50 years old .
she was left behind by a woman and two adult children .
there is free circulation in Culiacan .
however , the subject of Valdez basically lies only in silence .
since the arrest of Guzman last year and the extradition to the United States in January , the Blue Card has been one of the most bloody battlefields in the country , as rivalries are fighting to fill the power vacuum .
it makes no difference that , on the streets of Blue authorisation , a few people or even a number of people are dumped every day , or that the dead are grinding riddled from two @-@ fold sweets of narcots , which are greater than many homes living .
let us forget , for a moment , that the time of peace refers to the fact that only one cartel is headed by a maritime state with valuable ports and drugs routes to the United States .
in spite of all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers of his work , Riodoce &apos;s co @-@ founder and the President , IsMay Bojorquez ( 60 ) , feels that he was not able to defend his friend .
he believes that the killing was facilitated by two mistakes .
the first of these was the publication in February of an interview with Guzman &apos;s sons of the cartel , which is competing with the sons of Guzman .
this piece of correspondence could have been alluded to by gangs suspected of being able to buy all copies of the publications as soon as they were reached in newspapers .
another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country in the name of his own security , after a crackdown took place in one of the newspapers with the same story in another .
Valdez was legalising both in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico .
he had been alive for so long that his friends and colleagues expected him to exist forever .
in 2003 , he served as a veteranreporter report at Noroeste , when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce , sold 50 @-@ dollar shares .
Bojorquez said , &apos; It was impossible to deal with the press without touching on the drug problem &apos; .
the newspaper took time to know about its courageous and honest labels , and sales and advertising increased .
Reporters were keen to publish vigorous studies without fear of censorship and readers sleep in a print of which they could read stories that no one else dared to reflect .
eight years after the establishment of Riodoce , the newspaper won the prestigious award of Maria Moors Caboti for his demonstrations in Latin America .
in the same year in Valdez , the Committee for the Protection of journalists ( AKK ) won the International Press Freedom Award for its courage to follow Mexican drug creation wherever it takes .
he openly admitted that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to live on , &quot; he said the AKK award .
last October , in an interview given to the television channel Rompeviento TV , he said that drug trafficking is a way of life for you .
&apos;To take on board the challenge posed by the journalists &apos; office , Peru &apos;s second chance of playing a fool game .
I do not want to ask me what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I did not say what is going on . &quot;
Riodoce collelova strives Valdez , a joke who roppered like madrus , a friend who generously divided embryos and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they gave their support to his routine .
he was always wearing his own village .
he went across the office to El Wogau yabo bar and was always on the same desk .
now they are asking whether his stubbornness became fatal to him .
his death has also cast them in doubt as to how best to do his job and stay alive .
&quot; they do not like the arrogance of their women , their children , their legitimate businesses , their secret landing cards used to transport drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things should not have been touched , &quot; said Bojorquez .
the result , even in the best times , will be strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ determination .
trusting your instincts .
if this is a case of suspiciously framing , the hotel away .
according to Riodoce editor Andres Villarreali , the problem is that &apos; fragrance can be deceived ... , and so was it with JSE &apos; .
he and others are saying that you no longer have old rules , just as they do not apply in the Tamaulik , Veracruz , Guerreros or other states , which are home to the poisonous composition of profitable smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt state officials .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the space in which Riodoce workers met for security training , mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed ; a few days before that , it was revealed that only the button sold to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
in front of the house , two policemen sought a relaxation of 40 degrees .
they were appointed by the government to host the offices of the Republican University of Culiacan in a four @-@ day building .
some of the reporters wondered in a half joke whether these police officers belong to the 50 % of the police officers whose Governor himself hailed untrustworthy .
several months have elapsed since the reporters had travelled to mountainous rural areas where controls are de facto in the hands of drug gangs .
Riodoce &apos;s edition of this week dealt with three main features .
one of them was the murder in Yaloa of the former boxomallego Valenciar Chavez venna .
in addition , they had a revealing story of government funds being spent on the home city of the Governor .
a group of people was kidnapped from Culiacan , one of the most expensive restaurants .
there was no official announcement of who was kidnapped or how it happened , so it was necessary to be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city of Leicrestauran , both for drug traffickers and for public authorities .
Reporter learned from public documents that a restaurant has been registered for the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling institution of the Revolutionary Party ( IRP ) , which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the last century .
in recent times , several IRP kuberner has been accused of widespread coverage of cases of corruption .
in Villarline , the reporter asked her to write previous incidents in the same place , including how the son of Guzman , who wear the name of El Chapo , escaped military bets .
in just a few months previously , readers would have been looking for a copy of Valdez in order to obtain information about kidnapping from the best sources .
&quot; in the past , we would have known what happened , &apos; said a 46 @-@ year @-@ old Villarline , whose body construction has earned him a banner called El Flaco .
&quot; now all the channels of communication have broken down with our sources . &quot;
the Valdez office has become a reservoid of bridges and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists , and the editorial workers have become something they could never wait for activists on behalf of the press .
Reporter Miriam Ramirez seized a couple of bridges and orientations next morning at the local public Prosecutor &apos;s office for another journalist .
in the western state of Michoacan three days after the killing of Valdez .
it has been found as a dead body and , according to officials , it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests .
journalists from all over the country have become more vocal and underline the phrase &apos; SOS press &apos; as organised protesters on pavements and buildings .
on this day in Washington , President Bojorquez will have the opportunity to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case .
a day after the death of Valdez , when he met with Your licence Governor , Ramirez accused the authorities of crying out for journalists and killing them for telling the truth .
after that , he asked for he to be diverted from government action elsewhere , concerned that hatred has affected objectivity .
Valdez had said on repeated occasions that Mexican journalists were &apos; restricted &apos; by organised crime , co @-@ guilty state officials and an indifferent society .
in his last book &apos; drug media &apos; , he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also carried out under the command of politicians and security forces who are at the mercy of organised crime .
Articulo 19 , the Media Monitoring Group , awarded more than half of the attacks by journalists on the police and public officials last year .
&apos;In Mexico you happen , because you want to keep quiet , &apos; Ramirez said .
there will obviously be a bloody impact .
no one will forget the death of the blogger , Maria Elizabeth Macias , in the northern border state in Tamaulik six years ago .
she was found dead with a letter which was probably signed by the cartel LOS Zetas : &apos; I am here for my reporters &apos; .
the computer glass offices and elephants hanged alongside his beloved head .
some of the publications have decided to close their doors , for example , in the northern border state of El Norte , Chihuahuahua , following the killing of their correspondent Aung slava Battihi in March .
others will pass on as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their president in 2004 .
in 2010 , the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with the editorial &apos; What do you want ? &apos;
some journalists have fled their home states , or even their country .
it is a nervous decision .
in theory , it is difficult to find a job , and they still have to boast today in order to avoid dangers .
and sometimes behind them , as was probably the case with photographi Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered three months after Veracruz in 2015 , together with four women in Mexico , in 2015 .
those who remain in place and continue to work will have to refute risky decisions on a daily basis .
someone who once wanted to become a poet admits that reflection of the drug business frightens him .
&quot; Mexico is on its way to hell , and that is why I am going to report , &quot; he said .
at the midnight of one recent Friday , when the latest number had already been cut off , Riodoce &apos;s editor swept the office on a paperwork and beating beer when all telephone lines suddenly commenced .
in Mazatlanis , a staggering cumbersome city , 19 people were killed according to validated data in fire exchanges between rival gangs and security forces .
the war escort continued , just as a number of messages retained by cartels found in the area were also promised .
according to the same pavements , reporters issued news on the Riodoce site using a mobile phone .
in the front of next day there was a need to change .
the scenes seized another fire exchange in the Maghreb region .
Bojorquez pibeauty stood up for police officers to see whether they are vigilant .
if they feared , they did not at least show this .
workers of Riodoce were posted in his footsteps under massive banknotion , where his average finger can be seen for the whole of your mother tongue .
&apos;How could you think about closure at all , &apos; said Bojorquez &apos; on the same day that Javier Solana was slaughtered , a traineeship asked me to report to the streets ? &apos;
Dinosaurus used protective colour in order to avoid enemies
at first glance , it looks like a form , albeit rather frightening .
scientists have now unveiled the first findings concerning the existence of unbelievable rubbish numbers discovered by Canadian miners , which has so well preserved that the experts have described it as &apos; dinosaences Mona Lisa &apos; .
it has maintained so well that it was even possible to find out that the skin covered by his souss was a bunch of colours , and his past had been somewhat &apos; complicated &apos; .
a report published in a magazine published by Health Biology described status as &apos; the best preserved soomaldinosaur that has ever been found &apos; and &apos; one of the best Curriculum readings worldwide &apos; .
in the case of fossil fuels , it is a new category of nododge that lived in the middle of the seasond era , from 110 to 112 million years ago .
its incredibly good retention in Raba was carried out by theatres who describe it as &apos; truly significant &apos; .
according to National Geotheory , this type of phosphorus , which has ever been found , has been the best preserved as part of the meals covered .
it was found on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk when he extracted Suncor Millenium in Fort McMurray near Northern Albertas in Canada .
it hit something that did not recall the passion surrounding it and decided to look into more detail .
identified phosphorus was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology museum .
for the next six years , an animal was designed to extract 2 500 pounds ( 1100 kilometres ) from the land unit .
after all this hard work , the end result will now finally be ready to bring the public ahead .
&apos;If you put a bit of a blind eye , you can almost believe he is sleeping , &apos; said Caleb Brown , the editor Royal Tyrrell in the museum in which he is stunned .
&quot; this goes down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur - dinosaur Mona Lisana . &quot;
when studying his skin , she found out that this vegetation session , which is covered by soaps and resembles divisive tank , was likely to pose a significant threat to meat @-@ food compounds .
it used a red and white sense of protection to hide from predators and applied sheltering techniques , which are referred to as &apos; shelter &apos; and which are also used by many modern animals .
it made it possible , according to the experts , to enter the dinosaur better , and to avoid enemies , as the major dinosaurs were likely to hunt him .
for the first time in May , the presence of a family of nodosatologists aged 110 million went into news and is now visited in the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology museum .
the theatres have now looked at the existence and gave it the name of the Borealopelta Marmitchelli museum mark Mitchell , which spent more than 7 000 hours in order to reveal the suffering .
thanks to the amazing survival of his father , Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists have been able to document the shape and size of Finns .
they found refuge - a common method of protection in the animal state - which means that the title of existence was the harshest as the lower .
even though there has been a lack of objectivity , findings come as a surprise , as Borealopelta is much greater than those living today with defective animals .
this suggests that dinosaur pressure was sufficiently intentionally hunted by other compound compounds , that evolutions were preferred instead of being a surviving tactic , instead of hiding apart from confrontation .
however , most of the animals used today , such as fear , seals or meals , are far smaller and more vulnerable , indicating that nodosaurus had had to make a real effort to survive .
&quot; the vigorous cooling @-@ off of the dinosaur , covered by massive and abundant soaps , shows how dangerous it might have been to predatory animals in the seasonic era , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds of diabetes also revealed that a dinosaur &apos;s skin was a red bag .
scientists will continue to provide an investigation in order to get angles about this life , including retained content of this style of salt , in order to find out what the animal is the last word .
they believe that the dinosaur has fallen into the dead rivers , thereby entering the sea , where he had sunk in front of the ocean .
at the time , Alberta was just as warm as now in South Florence , and rivers and oceans were likely to extend far further to the internal land than now .
&quot; this nodosaurus is truly significant , since it has fully preserved soustic skin , but it has also remained three dimensions while preserving the original shape , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; as a result of this , the animal today looks almost the same as in the seasonic age .
to reconstruct this , it does not need to have a great deal of imagination to use - it is enough simply to run bridges and it seems to be like sleeping . &quot;
there was a time of crisis in which muscles - heterohants - were stunned in the land , with huge increases in meat eaten .
even though their Queen Tyrannosaurus rex lived many millions more years later than Borealopelta , some of his frightening predecessors could have hunted out of this astronomic dinosaur .
these include Acrocanthosauru , 38 legs ( 11.5 metres ) , a long and six @-@ tonne monster .
scientists whose recent findings have been published in the Biology magazine believe that Borealopelta uhuta was stunned after death in the sea and that this muzine was mutualised .
on 21 March 2011 , Shawn Funk was detected when he extracted from Fort McMurray to northern Albertas in the Millenium mine in Canada .
according to Muuseum , it is best preserved by soomomalsis in the world , including skins and sooms , and it is comprehensive from concentration to wood .
these percentages were , on average , 18 legs ( five metres ) long and fixed up to GBP 3 000 ( 1 300 kg ) .
there were two 20 customs queues out of it .
scientists believe that , through the present Western Canada , this hijacked vegetation compound , the river that was flooded in the high seas was proud of .
however , the place of absorbing a dinosaur at sea helped to maintain its characteristics in an excellent detail .
the glaciers of this particular father , coal , have so well preserved that the mygarchical Homoss continue to cover skin glaciers .
as Michael Greshko writes in the National Geosian magazine : &apos; such statehood is just as rare as lotovictory .
the more I see it , the more incredible it seems .
the burnt skin glaciers are still covered by mystery stores located in the yellow .
a better front is lying next to him , and the way in which five properties are silenced .
I will be able to lecture the Finns in his winter . &quot;
how did one activist find an answer to the question of &apos; whose thanks ? &apos;
on 9 August 2014 , Brittany Ferrell received complete shock .
just a few days after the trip to New York , that was the birthplace of St. Louka Airbnb on a leaked bed , travelling on Facebook a phone .
he came on top of the post of his former school companions .
it said : &apos; the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old adolescents , and he is still on the streets &apos; .
he was confused as to why nobody else had outsourced this information from his stream , so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
Pidega @ TheePMilah &apos;s user &apos;s mail had been handed over several times on his line of time .
Mr St. Syripequality from the region of Louise provided real @-@ time shuttles to Michael Brown , the death of an unarmed 18 @-@ year @-@ old black man who was killed by Mr Ferguson Missouris White police officer .
he gave a picture of the life of Brown in a woman who was present on the street , living there for four hours .
&quot; it is crazy , &quot; said Ferrell additions .
however , death was nothing new for him or for the community .
he put his phone off , but later this evening , he looked back at a tag announcing the arrival of people in Canfield Drive .
Mr Jagati photographs of the police and the harsh people and a man who claimed to be the father of Brown and kept the &apos; Ferguson police killed just my unarmed son ! &apos; .
he watched in real time a stream in which the policeman stood before a group of protesters with a hatching house .
in another video , another police officer , he said : &apos; I kill you all ... animals &apos; .
Mr Ferrell reminds him of the way in which he struck himself from the point of view : &apos; this is unusual &apos; .
&quot; this is not the kind of murder we are accustomed to and which we could describe as typical . &quot;
I was horrified at this point .
I was angry and advised . &quot;
he booked a return flight and went home next day .
having buried at 23 : 00 , he went to his father for his six @-@ year daughter and decided that they would travel to Ferguson next morning .
what took place next three years with Ferrelli and Ferguson will be a central issue in the new documentary &apos; Whose street ? &apos; ( &apos; whose thanks ? &apos; ) , to be presented in cinemas on 11 August .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and defeat , strength and resilience from the point of view of those who live in this community and who took up the streets by asking for answers .
when Mr Ferreira , together with a daughter - who had a lipsy sticker in the supermarkets and a chat with it - went on to Ferguson , they once again talked about a subject that had come before them many times before this morning - the experience and living conditions of black people .
&quot; do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights ? &quot;
&quot; we are currently travelling to Ferguson because the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old boys , and that is not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take him on board , &quot; said Ferrell later .
&quot; what is happening now is ... the culmination of what happened in the past .
it needs to know and see this and grow in the middle of it .
it needs to learn about a activists and organisation , and at the same time know the different layers of experience and living conditions of the Muslim people , and what we need to do in order to be free and free .
even if I manage to raise him in such a way that he does not personally copy brutal racism , he does not differ from another black girl .
I feel I would be doing him a disservice if I were to protect him from this world . &quot;
the first stop they did in the vicinity of Fergusoni was by the South Florissanti - in the filling of the police stations , which had become a kind of camps where activists were waiting for news about the police officer Darren Wilson , who was not ultimately charged with charges .
there , Mr Ferreira and his daughter united forces with the local business owner , who prepared the southern islands .
they brought together food homes and helped to spread them to the protesters .
for Ferrelli , a new type of activist was slow to take shape .
&quot; my activist changed completely after 9 August , &quot; he said , saying that when he was a student at Missouri @-@ St. Louise University , he was the President of the Alliance for Young students and focused on food justice and health inequalities in Muslim communities .
&quot; I had no experience of organisation .
all of this was just laissez &apos;√™tre &apos; .
weeks later , at the time of the Ferreira evening demonstration , she met a film co @-@ director , Sabaah Folayana .
Folayan said that he and the film operator , Lucas Alvarado @-@ Farrar , simply wanted to document what is happening .
in the face of Ferrelli , the question came : &apos; are you trying to document what is happening or find a story that can be exploited ? &apos;
such scepticism was due to countless cases in which people - often white - come to the community and try to take advantage of its protein and resilience .
Folayan explained in a recent interview : &apos; we had heard that the voice of people born and growing in Ferguson would not be heard , and we wanted to do so differently &apos; .
Folayan had already put his hand in hand with Damon Davati , an artist in the region who was well @-@ known for activists in connection with prisoners who were sentenced to death .
his involvement made the project attractive for Ferrelli and the other six others , who were followed by a team of Whose street ets for years following the shooting of Brown .
&quot; in this documentary , nobody speaks for us or for us , but we speak to ourselves , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; it was important for me how these people are portrayed , because that is how I am portrayed . &quot;
although the aim was not to focus on the experience of Ferrelli - the intention was to show that the Movement is not about &apos; donor leader , but about bringing together the community &apos; , as Mr Folayan said - he made the most open part of the film .
as a result , &apos; Whose street ets ? &apos; , surprisingly personal aspects of the life of Ferrell , such as ruthfulness and marriage with his wife .
&quot; I felt as if I had started , &quot; said Ferrell , saying the first time in which he saw the urban works ready .
&quot; however , I have realised that there must be a certain vulnerability to this work and to the humanisation of black people . &quot;
what is more , Ferrell &apos;s story emphasises and puts again the role of black LGBT women in the wider Black Sea Lives Matter movement .
two of the three initiators of the movement , who thought in the social media about the killing of the black teenagers , Trayvon Martin , in 2012 , of the hashtag # BlackLivesMatter , are homosexuals .
&quot; the leading role played by black homosexuals has kept the movement across the board , &quot; said Ferreira , and this is precisely because we must constantly fight on several fronts .
Mustanabad homosexuals have to bear all this burden . &quot;
Folayan agreed , pointing out that &apos; movement is indeed alive for black women , and many of them black homosexuals &apos; .
at the same time , he says that &apos; this is not something of a kind to create equal opportunities &apos; - Ferrell was not chosen as a film centre because of his identity .
&quot; he was a man of whom the right energy was evening , &quot; he said .
&quot; however , it is not a coincidence that he went directly on the frontline , as black LGBT women are much at stake when living in such hubs .
his energy can be perceived through the screen . &quot;
at the same time , news cameras from Ferguson have long disappeared , but racial links between the community and the police remain fragile .
the conditional sentences imposed on Ferrell at the time of the demonstration for blocking the road lasts for 2.5 years .
he describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere in the region he calls home simply as a &apos; huge threat &apos; .
nonetheless , it still attaches importance to the mantra that it has been eating memory since it took to the streets of Ferguson a whole three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing more to lose than our chains . &quot;
7 examples of how to overcome the Weekise du poppy
some of the more frequent mechangers , even after a little bit of piles , find themselves suffering from , hence help .
or on the basis of the words &apos; How a potaque &apos; , the cradle of the stick .
however , this is only an inevitable postponement and a decent blessing for health .
what can you do in order , after today and tomorrow &apos;s Weekise trall - or whatever - to feel better on this morning and to overcome poppy as painfully as possible ?
Joo Water .
for alcohol and vice versa , after a great deal of pipe in the morning ... or possibly even alcohol .
as the body loses a lot of liquids when it comes to alcohol consumption , it has to be recovered in some way .
minerals are also thrown out of the body with water , and sestap is a good hair of mineral water .
since , after being thrown off , swept up , sweets are often irritated , it is particularly good if it is bubble @-@ free , or only easy to legislate .
let us walk away .
it would certainly not cost a boy to split trees into the grandmother - it might prove fatal to be a false decision .
however , an easy walk @-@ out helps the body to remember once again what sense it is in life .
Sleeping in Telgis and sleeping boys is a more time @-@ consuming way to become a whole .
give poor energy back gradually and cautiously .
if you are on the verge of overdrinking from yesterday , then it is certainly not worth trying to charge a heavy fat .
for example , a fresh pipe containing fruit fabrics as a body is set up quietly .
if health is already suffering in the South , it would be possible , for example , to try the weddings .
and , a little later , there will be clarity .
a referee was avoided .
this diure tachom will free the body from the last water .
as has already been said , water and volume are your friends .
it makes a contribution to painkillers .
if you are to be painkiller in order to prevent poppy in the evening , you will have to deal not only with alcohol , but also with paratsetal or ibuproprov , and so will it disappear .
so many more hits and , in the future , boys will be worse .
in addition , painkillers do not remain in the coffers for a very long time .
if you take a painkiller in the morning , let us do it with an empty piece - it annoys your already tired sweat .
or if you do not have a partner , you can do well with you .
there is something like walking , but there will be no quantum leap when you walk .
however , too active a pace and an outrageous bet were avoided : the physical effort should be moderating during the poppy season .
the road joke .
the words of friends of the time , friends of friends of friends of friends of the past , paternalism and Nazis friendly about both himself and others ( suffering ) .
Nali and laughter may not make a pocket , but it is certainly easier for them to follow .
for once , the boy goes over anyway !
University of Northwestern professors and Oxford workers are sought as suspects in murder .
according to the police , a professor of the University of Northwester and the University of Oxford are being sought nationally , who have received suspicions following the deadly petty petty wives of male people to find one of Chicago &apos;s luxury facilities .
according to judicial documents by Cook &apos;s county , on Monday , arrests were issued for 42 @-@ year @-@ old Wyndham Lathemi and 56 @-@ year @-@ old Andrew Warreni , accused of being murdered at first instance in Trenton H. Cornell @-@ Duranhanu .
according to the documents , 26 @-@ year @-@ old Cornell @-@ Duranhanu died after repeated nails .
according to the warning that Chicago &apos;s police station issued to the community , the deceased was found on 27 July .
police officers received telephone calls and found a victim whose body had several towers for the arrival of the Grand Plaza Corterhouse .
according to the officials , the Cornell @-@ Duranhanu events were sentenced to death , and the investigators are treating rape as a murder , while the police are actively looking for two suspects .
Mrs Lavid has been working as co @-@ professors of micro @-@ biology and immunology at the University of Northwester since 2007 .
Alan K. Cubbage , Vice @-@ President of University Public Relations , said in a statement sent as an e @-@ mail that Ladows have now been temporarily removed from work and that he is forbidden to enter the towns of the University of Northwester .
&quot; this is now a criminal investigation by the competent authorities , and the University of Northwester works with the investigators , &quot; said Cubbage .
Warren is a senior assistant in the financial department at the University of Oxford .
the representative of the University and Somerville College said in an email statement : &apos; we have been in contact with the British police and ready to assist US research authorities in every way possible &apos; .
in addition , the statement stated that Warreni colleagues were shocked and would like him to present himself .
Anthony Guglielm , Head of the Communications Department of Chicago , urges the authorities , with suspicion .
&quot; the police have an idea of where they are present , but we are dealing increasingly intensively with defining the exact whereabouts , &quot; said Guglielm .
according to Guglielm , suspects will be helped by local , regional and national authorities .
Guglielm said that the police had received telephone calls from the Grand Prix Corterhouse , who had just received a kryptic allude that there has been something happening in Corps No 1008 .
according to the police , it was a spectacular spectacle .
according to Guglielm , it is not clear whether the event itself was also taking place on 27 July .
he said that security cameras confirm the presence of Lathemi and Warreni in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor Lathares and the victim had a relationship , &quot; added Guglielm .
the Grand Prix leadership sent a letter to the people : &apos; the police is currently working to find a background to events and victims , and is looking at various motives , including the possibility of a family dispute &apos; .
firms that help your businesses avoid becoming next UbB
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of workers in his e @-@ commerce start @-@ ups , but the polls were futile .
the answers were often vague , useless or , worse still , misleading .
and even if he promised anonymity , some workers did not trust this process .
&quot; this system was simply not consistent and objective , &quot; said Errett , who is leading the company Madison Reed , which sells e @-@ commerce products with 75 employees in San Franciscos .
so he called on external actors to help .
start @-@ ups with new types of human resources are disappearing , helping businesses to find out what their workers feel .
by developing and licensing software to measure the involvement of workers , they enable companies to carry out flash surveys , target specific teams and demographic groups , offer anonymity for workers and complaint hotlines and , in some cases , allow insurers to bypass &apos; C level management &apos; and address the Bureau directly .
&apos;There are now tools such as Strava and Fitler , which are meant to monitor health , but where is Fitbi for your company ? &apos; asked Jim Barnett , co @-@ founder and CEO Reding City start @-@ ups Glint , whose software analysts are used by companies to measure the inclusion of workers .
according to Erretti , he has received a much better overview of what he thinks and knows in three years when he has used Glinti .
in addition to investigations and specific team studies , it provides for a company &apos;s heating card , which provides an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest level of support , enabling them to identify the causes .
companies have started to understand that they have to stay in touch with their culture of work so as not to become the next UbSR , which has been torn up in scandals since the former worker published a blog mail which described the harassment of those who dared to take the floor .
for start @-@ ups such as Gpoultry , the desire to have an overview is a lucrative business option .
global governance , regulation and conformity can be worth more than USD 118.7 billion by 2020 , according to a website of financial ethics statistics .
Denveris Colorado &apos;s start @-@ up company communautaire , which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour , observed an interest and an increase in activity this year against the backdrop of the dubious reputation of Uberia .
FIFcentil has almost 600 customers , including Airbus , Microsoft and Tesla .
Uber has recently registered himself as a customer .
like Glinles , Covenant companies will be able to send tailor @-@ made impulse polls , collect confidential answers in real time and look at the problematic areas of heat cards .
it will also provide a anonymous message book which will enable workers to report inappropriate behaviour .
and when it comes to the executive director , complaints go directly to the Bureau .
&quot; public opinion is anchored by the regulatory authorities , &quot; Chris Quinlan , founder and CEO , said Agenda centi .
Quinlan said that if a company is found to treat its workers badly or to act unethically , it could face serious consequences , such as consumer boycotts , the departure of workers and court cases , even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene .
Ruby flu , restaurant , which has more than 25 000 employees in 500 places of activity , has been used for more than a year , in order to ensure workers &apos; awareness of the rules and procedures and to provide an easy way of communicating with the corporation headquarters .
when an employee wanted to announce the problem earlier , he had to find a telephone number or an email address at the company headquarters , he had to make a formal complaint and hope that it will be taken seriously .
this was often a damning and inconvenient process , James Vitrano , the general adviser of Ruby theory , said that there was no good way of monitoring workers &apos; complaints .
however , at a time when the company is using modulation , problems such as discrimination , harassment or unfair wage practices , which did not end up in the past with leaders operating in offices located in other cities or states , can be identified and dealt with more quickly .
&quot; I have the opportunity to get closer to the hollow experience of the workers of 360 degrees , &quot; said Vitrano , who chairs Ruby hood &apos;s risk management group .
&quot; and we will protect our shareholders from legal disputes with workers . &quot;
Quinlan said that companies started to take ethical behaviour , values and employee involvement more seriously in 2002 , after the collapse of the audit company Arthur Andersen due to ethical violations in relation to the Enron scandal .
however , only when &apos; social media became mature &apos; did companies realise that they could not prevent their blackmailing from being hijacked online .
&quot; before using the technology to monitor ethical behaviour , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both Glint and Acccent offer their software as a service by making companies pay periodically for the use of their products .
this is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have been supporting both start @-@ ups .
Acccenti financed USD 10 million in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Customs Capital , thereby increasing the value of the capital collected by EUR 47 million .
Glinti invested USD 10 million in November , Bessemer Venture partners , increasing the company &apos;s total funding to USD 60 million .
investments of this kind do not come as a surprise if we take into account the interconnectedness of companies , culture and venture capital .
more and more research shows that today &apos;s workers expect more jobs than before .
in more competitive markets , such as Silicon Valley , high wages and interesting projects are merely on the table .
the workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and devote their time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy in the company , they feel that they are listening to them and that the work they do is satisfying , they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company , &quot; said Nina McQueen , Vice @-@ President LinkedInis , who has general benefits and staff experience .
investors make a profit if their portfolio companies do a good job ; businesses do well when workers are committed and involved .
if the analysts on the third side promise to increase the commitment and involvement of workers , then it is not the case that they receive support .
it is important , according to experts in the field of worker inclusion , to have data on worker inclusion .
however , these data will be useless if the company monitors do nothing to do with them .
in fact , when a company asks its employees for feedback , it can lead to expectations that change is ahead of us .
and if changes do not take place quickly enough or not at all , they could cause disappointment and decrease the involvement of workers .
&quot; if you ask 4 000 proposals , you have to be ready for 4 000 conversations , &quot; the President of the consultancy and business administration , Kotter International , Russell Raath , who has seen companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection .
&quot; because if things do not stop , then the workers will think : &apos; did you actually listen to me ?
do you care ?
and if you do not care , why should I care ? &apos;
according to Erretti , the Madison Reeval , which is now carrying out six studies among workers , has been able to implement measures on the same day as the problem has been reported via Glinti .
and , after receiving feedback from disappointed workers on the pace of decision making and the quality of communication , he was able to reorganise several teams in the company and provide communication training to deal with the problems .
however , Ruby Cameroon is collecting new data on workers and it is hoped that , in the long term , it will result in a longer @-@ term commitment of workers in industry known for its massive turnover .
&quot; if you are not committed to ensuring transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vitrano .
&quot; if you lose people , you will lose customers .
and if you lose customers , you will lose businesses . &quot;
euro area stagnating mark is Baltics : incomes grow rapidly
although the crisis in 2008 and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on Bali , the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe , with reference to the report by the European Central Bank .
according to the Central Bank , since 1999 , total economic output per capita has exceeded expectations in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
there are low debt burdens , fast @-@ growing institutions and business @-@ friendly and free market @-@ friendly policies behind success .
&quot; the Baltic States , together with Slovakia , are among the few countries in the euro area , where the EU average has been substantially closer to the purchasing power system . &quot; said the Central Bank .
although the aim is that total economic output per capita compared to the richer Western Europe , in 2015 , the total output of the Baltic economies per capita amounted to just 2 / 3 / 15 countries representing the European Union before the enlargement of 2004 .
low wages have led them to seek better wages abroad .
although the European Central Bank sees Bali in a positive light and the economy grows this year , the local population is not enthusiastic at all .
according to the latest Eurobarometer survey , only one quarter of the population of Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies are going very well or rather well .
in the Czech Republic and Poland it was thought little less about the economies of their own countries than half of those questioned .
NCAA &apos;s decision to cancel two @-@ day trends makes Bruinsi &apos;s days long .
it is almost 23 o &apos;clock when thrombond UCLA footballers stop talking at the end of a new exercise at the University of the team .
some of them have put a burden on the back of their company , revealing their efforts for the first day of the training camp .
for a large part of the team , these gang minutes offer midday couples .
the players taking part in cucumbers will go back after three hours to the common scene , before returning to meetings at 6.30 next morning in Wandarman &apos;s footwear .
&quot; the next three days will be a real challenge for them , &quot; said Jim Mora , the Bruinsi treghter , a little before the Monday took Tuesday .
NCAA &apos;s decision to cancel two times a day to reduce the burden on players has , in fact , made their days longer - at least until the end of the winds - to one side of the day on Friday .
for this reason , the three first operations of UCLA were prompted to start at 19.15 in order to fit players into an already tight timeline .
the transition from two strikes a day means more one day - the beginning of the Bruinsi training camp was raised almost a week ahead compared with the previous season and , for the first time in Mora &apos;s six Westwood season , there will be workshops during summer courses .
they intend to have 18 trengths until 20 August before starting formal preparations for the opening game against Texas A &amp; M to take place in September .
according to Mora , he is in favour of a change to the NCAA rule , even though it adds another item to the close schedules of players .
&quot; they have an enormous burden three or four days , and this is a serious challenge , &quot; said Mora .
&quot; and they break through this challenge ; they are struggling , they are nice young people .
I believe that , when we arrive on Saturday and we have more time , it will be really a little bit . &quot;
when the camp is closed , the UCLA training operations will be closed , which is not an easy task , however , given a clear view of the parking record close to their fields and of the bypassing Luskini centre , a higher @-@ class hotel that has already escaped off the net of protection around the gates .
since this weekend , hotel Bruinsi players are occupying , but Mora recognised that there could be problems with free tobacco during the season .
&quot; we are implementing security measures , &quot; said Mora .
&quot; this is a real cause for concern , and it is not exaggerated to think that people are entitled to rent a piece of filter from there .
if the summer has a record lease , it can do quite a good deal .
but we are using a security team there and 8 parking stations .
let us do our best by using our existing ones .
I will try not to be very concerned about this .
we have a plan in place . &quot;
in the case of Saduare @-@ Ivanova electoral union born to the central party , Kristiina Ojuland , who was evicted from the Reform Party , and of Maria Kaljete , who was forced to leave the ECB , we in Tallinn and the political parties to show the entrepreneurial Association in Tallinn - it would appear that the election unions set up on the initiative of party politics will take part in local elections at least as much as political parties this year .
however , buses will be counted in the autumn , and the key question will be whether there will be enough disappointing voters for all of them .
who will remain on the island ?
if the support office of Edgar Salevare reduced to a small extent , it can anticipate the events organised to honour her electoral union .
one member of the national assembly , a few former and present central parties and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union ?
and why is it that some of the supporters and sisters of Saduare evade candidacy in Tallinn , and why is it possible to look for a company &apos;s &apos; Saduare list &apos; to be turned into a reality ?
in any case , the municipality &apos;s chauvinist musicides film to the Russian poem , in which it participates the older city of Lasnam√§e , and the original computer play in which the prime minister , J√ºri Rata , has to avoid lomnipe and hurricans who are on his way when travelling - will the central party , for the first time , seek votes to be allowed to the ballot boxes by 16 and 17 @-@ year @-@ olds ?
we look forward to seeing other political parties &apos; perception of the youth election campaign .
if the Kanal 2 or TV3 viewers are confronted with a black hall from the beginning of August , there will be two options : to accept that , in future , only ETV , ETV2 , ETV + , Tallinn TV and English France24 channels or to donate ten @-@ monthly TV operators .
there are probably also those who openly rejoice about advertising @-@ free television experience at the beginning , but in the end - albeit reluctantly - pay for television and advertisements .
According music , folding people and rubbish left on the streets are unpleasant by almost every major music filter .
however , if you do not want to be part of the honey yourself , it would be worth going home rather than being painted at home - and leaving the Coptic place of sleeping to the festivals .
Washington amends the rules of the Green Card
media publications are quoted by President Donald Trumpi , who says that a new US immigration plan is planned to change the rules of the Green Card .
the plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 people a year , stricter rules on obtaining temporary employment visas and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visas .
the new rules have been proposed by the Republican people , and the President supports them .
the bill goes to the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers &apos; money because it will change the way in which green cards are issued to US citizens .
the law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme .
the new application process provides an advantage to candidates who speak English and who have the financial means to support themselves and to have the skills for the benefit of our economy , &quot; said Trump , according to media publications in the United States .
Siberia seto young people move to the city , pensioners back to the land .
Jevseyev Anatol continues the famous seto gold miners along the River Maana .
she works 140 kilometres away from home to Maana tributaries at Kuvai as a motor driver .
this is a hard job : two months and months after rest , 12 hours of work and then only 10 days at home and again .
during the three years spent in the Artella , Anatol has seen gold only once .
&apos;There is a resounding procedure : when you go into it , you will check thoroughly that you do not lead to a viral , and if you turn out that you don &apos;t take it &apos; , you will talk Anatol .
Mare Piho spoke in the village of Haida with the local seto Jaga , who has spoken a great deal to him about the memory of his family in Siberia .
the archaic culture still preserved by Siberian setos will also have an impact on domestic seals , because it is just so shocking that Piho Mare , in most detail , believes in remote setos .
his first investigation trip to Siberia will pass for 30 years this year .
during that time , he has been there 14 times and lived there for one year .
how much was missing out to Siberia at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century to get the land here ?
this is an unresolved issue .
I would argue that 8 000 .
I took note of this in the words of Siberian seto men , who themselves have thought about it .
it is difficult to say exactly that , because up to 30 people could come to one group at the time , but the passport was only given to a man .
the passport was given only one thing , but was children , sisters , etc .
look at how great this territory was here .
it was many times greater than that of the historian .
after all , it was necessary to educate , manage it in some way .
Setols came here as farmers , but their lives changed , because here they came to areas that were not only linked to agriculture , but also to rivers ( palgiparation ) , gold mines , industry .
for example , in New @-@ Petseris , many pigs arrived later on in Krasnojarsk @-@ 45 , where Soviet power built the uranium enrichment plant - J. P. - when it was formed .
did the Seimas form the majority of the population in this region at that time ?
yes , they lived on a paternalistic basis .
in addition , a long tradition continued to marry between one another and a lot of childbirth .
seven to eight children in the family were common .
how many cultures of Siberian setopes differed and different from that of mother land ?
they are different , even though what was said here was once the same .
they gave rise to a great many popular ideas .
they then also made a difference ( ideas of peoples ) , but they always made the difference that had been brought about and what had been done here .
climate change has had a major impact on the traditional rivalry of mixtures , because there is a cold crop here .
the proposed changes have changed .
Setomaal , for example , was skinned , but it was simply frozen here .
where are the villages of Siberian setopes and what life will live there ? / graphics : Alari Paluends
the link with the mother country was spiritually strong , it was regarded as very important .
it seems to me that now this Setuony is going to return to it , it will affect them .
those girls who have lived in families have listened to amazing stories .
Piho is thinking of the people of the Estonian delegation , who came to the Kingdom of Haida at the beginning of July and lived four days in homes - J. P .
what is still here is shocking .
&quot; it is all too easy to come and go , too , because the city has an excellent location : railway hubs and roads at the crossroads , &quot; says Reigo Tamm , who comes from Tapy .
the city is no longer just a military capital , we have a great deal of creativity , sports and cultural places , and the bull gets everywhere .
Tapa is a tip @-@ pop of the city !
there is a small island along the current White river where the tablets tend to be hijacked .
&quot; this beautiful place does not seem to appear on the train window , &quot; don Reigo .
anyone who is not afraid of cold water will be able to swim in the river , because the river is full of resources .
I have been swimming there ; you can do it !
the river &apos;s water can hold a long time and just do a romantics - it can look to the river and think about life and behind it .
I , too , have come to grips with my brilliants there .
Ooperisolist Tamm has , apart from anything else , visited the river basin to get used to three bridges : &apos; that place is along the city , no one can come to answer if I say my own stories &apos; .
&quot; there is a wonderful view of the Tapy mountain , but there are also salaries where you can drinks , you can skip a winter , and now , for example , to play a disgolf game - golf tracks have been made , chains can borrow from sports centres . &quot; Reigo is leading .
of course , the old protagonists go there with their system , but I have not yet been able to play there .
obviously , Mrs Rasmus Goll Tapale will have to be invited , because she has experienced a discgolf game and she has the chains .
perhaps he is lending to me .
Reigo and M√§nnikull mountains were inextricably inseparable from the current age of self @-@ operisism .
at least during hours .
there have been a lot of tears left for this memory , disappointments , and rest in my sporting life .
not to mention broken belts and slogans .
&quot; the whole city of the city is now full of construction works , all of which will become unknown , &quot; applauds Reigo .
however , the old and tired stick building is a very attractive place in which oral discoveries are played .
I am pleased that , in 2012 in R.A.A.A.A.M , the leader of R.A.M , welcomed my idea and had to make a summer theatre with his theatre .
even though this year &apos;s theatre entitled &apos; Alegai Karenin &apos; has just passed , on 11 August , the railway station &apos; Elluwake &apos; is in the railway station when the old building is moving around in the 1980s .
&quot; between 11 and 13 August , the city of Tapa has Day , which has opened up open doors and clothes of cultural activities , including a popular treasure , will be speaking to Reigo , who is proposing to visit the city from 9 to 11 days .
the museum has already been running since 1994 in a tiny three @-@ chamber from 1 May to the puppet .
&quot; the house is small , but there is a great deal of publicity , and there is a huge amount of information , &quot; applauds Reigo &apos;s place , which is full of the history of the city of Tapa , most of which focuses on railways and sisters .
Reigo muds that , if you go through all of the recommended sites in Tapal , you will lose a lot of hot air but , fortunately , the small city is full of coffers .
&quot; we have such good eating places and sometimes , when you sit in caf√©s , you sometimes get the feeling that you are abroad , you describe him .
educated and young soldiers coming to Tapy spend a great deal of time in bottles and caf√©s sitting there , a mixed feeling that you are in Estonia and in your home city , but that is the interlocutor together .
I believe it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French people or the Americans .
soldiers , yes , we have a lot to do .
two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal tendering
Telecanal bTV quoted a foreign ministries who reported that two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal tendering .
in the morning of 1 August , in the Sithonia Peninsula , the police arrested people who illegally ordered a group , including two Bulgarians .
they were released on the same day , but there is currently an investigation .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said to the TV channel that Bulgarians were later released .
the Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free tendering and are already imposing heavy fines on all those who do not provide for it .
checks will continue throughout the season .
according to the Ministry of Justice , fines may be imposed .
the wolves that teach the people are breaking the sheep .
breeders will have to give the wollahs &apos; educational material &apos; once again after a year - the wolves that apparently teach the wagons have already broken a number of sheep .
this year the wolves in Hiiu &apos;s county have broken sheep three times , together with 23 sheep , and eight have been injured , signing the Hiiu page .

there are also data from the Environment Agency in syndrome that soil was not born on Hishells and that the Hishell hunting Council information is fixed this year on the island for two wolves .

rules for the management of genetically modified crops must be clear
the Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft law on the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment ( GMOs ) and amending plant protection law .
the amendment of the law removes the creation of a separate collection of data for both genetically modified ( GM ) crops and operators , using the plant health register in the future .
in addition , it amends the obligation of the GM crop manager to have prior agreement with the designated person dealing with beekeeping .
although at the moment genetically modified crops are not cultivated in Estonia , we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of GM and non @-@ GM crops .
this is at least as long as there is no decision to declare Estonia GM @-@ free , &quot; Sigmar Suu Kyi , President of the plant health department at the Department of Rural Affairs , said .
&quot; at the same time , it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate , take into account the costs and administrative burdens for both the private and public sectors , in addition . &quot;
the draft law repeals the provisions relating to the collection and management of GM crops in the EU GM crop sites and operators , lays down requirements for the management of GM crops and for the start of economic activities .
specifically with regard to beekeeping , the current obligation to inform beekeepers of the cultivation of GM crops will be replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with beekeepers before starting cultivation .
the draft law has been sent to ministries for coordination .
all interested parties will have the opportunity to find out about this in the draft information system and , if they so wish , to present their views to the Ministry of Rural Affairs .
the planned changes affect , in particular , those operating in the plant farming sector , beekeepers and the agricultural profession .
in the European Union , including in Estonia , only one GM crop - maize mon 810 - has been authorised to grow .
up to now , however , no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing GM crops .
this is due to the fact that in Estonia , there is no mammoth , no European media Observatory , on which mon 810 lines are resistant .
there are also ordings of this magic line on southern regions , and this in May is not appropriate to our climate conditions .
in order to be secure , in 2015 and 2016 , the Ministry of Rural Affairs ordered studies to detect potential contamination of GM organisms in the seeds of various surams , maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia .
the analysis of the samples carried out showed that seeds were not included externally and that , as a result of the study , the seeds of rape , maize and soya varieties in Estonia did not include genetically modified organisms .
in turn , one can conclude that in Estonia , GM crops are not deliberately cultivated , and it was also confirmed that there had not been random contamination .
Mr Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United in the form of Nemanja Maticu , &apos; genius &apos; .
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United Kingdom , in the form of Nemanja Maticu , has colluded &apos; genius &apos; , after having made its debate on Wednesday evening against a central player .
a player bought over GBP 40 million from Chelmer in Dublin started a last seasonal game in the UEFA Super Cupi line against Madrid on Tuesday 2 @-@ 1 victory in the algorithology , while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on attacks .
however , having sidelined the Aride seasonal Asian architecture , Maticl was in dire need of swimming , and was opposed to only 45 minutes , which , according to Mourinho , must be corrected by a firm before the Premier League season began .
&quot; he needs time , but he has experience , intelligence , genious nonsense - he has the courtesy of football , &quot; said Mourinho .
&quot; we will help him to achieve a form as soon as possible . &quot;
at the Aviva stage , other new recruited Victor Lindelof and Romeva lu Diamandouros and Mourinho suddenly started to put in place a man starting at the beginning of the season .
the Independent unveiled this week that Mourinho still wanted to recruit three footballers , but confirmed that the club had already done &apos; excellent work &apos; by concluding contracts with three of its four priority languages .
&quot; I am grateful to the club for being able to realise three out of four , &quot; he added .
&quot; I am even happier if they are able to carry out four of them , but they have worked hard for me . &quot;

the White House &apos;s audit cost to the taxpayer for thousands
according to military documents made public to the magazine , the decision by the White House to fly a naval helicopter last month for an event to mark American production to a southern horror of GBP 24 000 .
the green and white colours Sikorsky VH @-@ 3D , termed Marine One during the President &apos;s office , were central to the event in White Main on 17 July to showcase American construction programmes .
President Donald Trump , Vice @-@ President Mike Pence , and senior officials of the White House , unveiled industrial products from all 50 countries during his movement .
a helicopter built in Connecticutis was sponsored along with a clone from reputation , a fire @-@ fighting car from Wisconten and a walker made in Mississip .
according to reports by Mrs Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX @-@ 1 ) in charge of the operation of the HeliCopter , the HeliCopter helicopter was ordered to have the presence of a helicopter in the military office of the White House by a little 36 hours before a helicopter for a &apos; unusual &apos; event on the southern horror .
&quot; I wanted you to be aware of this , because it is an unusually high @-@ profile event , &quot; said HMX @-@ 1 komcommand√∂r a day before the event , in an e @-@ mail , to your top naval officer in the field of aviation .
the message stated that the helicopter would arrive at the southern horror on 17 July morning at 7 : 00 &apos;clock , and will remain there until the same night between 18 and 21 : 00 .
it was included that , if the departure from the White House were to be present , there would be a need for a return flight due to restrictions on working time , for a second agitation .
the original flight team was at helicopter during the event , and the security team of the estur remained close to the aircraft throughout this period of stay on the ground .
it was not possible to read out from the documents provided by the magazine whether or not a second amusement was ultimately needed .
the Hatch law prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political ends .
the documents show that HMX @-@ 1 investigated whether this event could violate this provision .
&quot; we asked whether it was in breach of Hatch &apos;s law and we were told that there would not be a breach , &quot; the commander wrote .
&apos;It seems that you have no choice , &apos; responded to a senior officer .
the White House declared the &apos; American @-@ made &apos; event to be an official event , and Hatch &apos;s law would not have covered it .
however , even official events have political undertones .
at that time , the President backed the efforts of health reform during the Senate and praised attempts to keep government regulations in check .
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force for political gain is not a new phenomenon .
Presidents must use them to travel .
however , the requirement to use them purely photographic is unusual .
in February , the Trump came to the attention when , at his first campaign event in Floridas Melbourne , the President &apos;s flight was on the water background , and on Twitter &apos;s account kicks off messages complaining about the way in which his predecessor used his flight .
&apos;White l Mal is very pleased with the exhibition &apos; made in America , where products were represented in all 50 countries made up of American workers from American materials , &apos; said Vice @-@ President Lindsay Walters , the spokesman of the White House .
HMX @-@ 1 teams often carry tests around Washington and the southern horror in order to beat the white house of the President of the United States with a single cent of precision .
when the Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , the HMX @-@ 1 White House organised 58 samples .
according to the interpreter , flights to the &apos; American @-@ made &apos; flight crews were considered to be the norm for a month of study flights .
Eskaadr helicopter was flying another 11 hours &apos; for non @-@ President support missions on that day .
according to the White House , none of the other sponsors of this event were cutting the taxpayers &apos; wallets .
according to Sikorsky &apos;s representative , a helicopter on the southern horror was not involved in carrying out filtering .
HMX @-@ 1 does not maintain the budgetary documents of President flights and it is difficult to find out the exact costs of the event .
however , according to hourly prices by the Ministry of Defence for the financial year 2017 , VH @-@ 3D will be reimbursed at USD 24 380 per hour .
the Eskaadr &apos;s documents indicated a flight extension of its main base , from e Quantico airport to Virginia , to 30 minutes in both directions .
the White House claims that the actual cost of using the helicopter is well below that amount .
&quot; it is very misleading to calculate taxpayers &apos; expenditure on the basis of estimated reimbursement rates , &quot; said Walters .
&quot; these estimated reimbursement rates include staff , maintenance and many other irrevocable expenditure , which will be taken into account for annual appropriations . &quot;
according to a study carried out in 2015 , the Ministry of Defence does not include staff costs , although they cover costs related to fuel , maintenance and contracts .
the former press officer of the White House , Sean Sharier , defended the use of helicopter at the time at the event .
&quot; the point is to show things made in America this week , &quot; said Sstoper .
&quot; and I know that the State of Sikorsky and Connecticuti is very proud that they contribute to our national security and that there are supposedly hundreds , if not even thousands , of people whose work depends on it .
and I believe that just like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly on .
so of course it is right to highlight this . &quot;
it is not clear whether or not the Trump tied a helicopter in the southern horror as part of the event , and whether or not , the fire @-@ fighting car was hiding behind the wheel .
within the White House , Trump Sikorsky addressed representatives by handing out media outlets about company products in his personal aircraft fleet .
&quot; I know Sikorskis very well , &quot; said the President , &apos; I have three of their products &apos; .

worse still lies ahead : a month later , his Olympic contest in Rios on account of his resignation was already covered by the first obstacle .
the time had to be taken down - was there any continuation of the 7 competition ?
is the two @-@ day effort still worth all this ?
Neiu thought for a long time , but found peace .
I had to think twice !
it is relatively difficult to describe this experience , but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen .
Thankfully , there was time for us to treat ourselves as a whole and to think twice .
&quot; I knew that I did not put a cocktag on the pill , &quot; ≈†adeiko talks about his self @-@ cleansing .
I was able to turn a clean page and move ahead with a new momentum .
Treener Anne hill said that it was very difficult to look at the suffering of negligence , but he realised that , above all , the sportsman himself had to make his own sense .
after all , he had been so repressed by everyone .
it was difficult to tolerate .

now it is going to have some kind of peace .
it is doing so to joy itself .

one alcohol whose drinking is equivalent to &apos; training &apos; .
Livestrong writes that Dr Gordon Sheperd is an elephant of so great wine games that he believes that wine can teach the brain better than any other thing in the world .
Sheperd is a neuroscientist of Yale University .
his message is not about alcohol , or about how it affects our feelings and ideas , but about the &apos; very active &apos; wine flavourings process .
when we sleep , wine was complicated by tailing , enjoying it and perceived the aftertaste , we are putting our brain in order to create a taste for wine .
in the words of Sheperd , there is no real taste in the boxes , but a taste of taste arises from the way wine stimulates the brain .
he points out how the brain &apos; sees &apos; colours &apos; .
&quot; taste is not wine ; taste creates wine as sweet , &quot; says Sheperd .
things that still affect the taste of wine are , for example , the number of our age , summer and even sylje produced by man .
Sheperd , of course , admits that wine is not full of Jews .
&apos;There must be more &apos; , he says .
if you take too big a longer , the system will be overloaded .
excess wine drinking can do no harm to the brain instead of benefits : according to a study in 2004 , people who drink more than three pieces of wine , memory loss , loss of balance and reduced mental capacity are at risk .
10 % of workers in the ICT sector in Estonia receive less pay from colleagues
staff search company fund figures reveal that 10 % of employees in the Estonian ICT sector receive lower salaries than colleagues .
Thirty per cent of the pay gap is between men and women , writes the portal Geenius .
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the ICT sector pay survey .
a total of 8 577 posts was examined .
63 % of posts were employed by men .
&quot; although only 3 companies stated that the pay gap is in favour of men and the rest of the companies considered that there is no pay gap , in reality , the average annual salary of men is 10 % higher than that of women and men aged 8 % higher than that of women on average , &quot; said Foncrates analysts Ilmar Majala .
&apos;Narcose &apos; : now that Pablo Escobar has gone , Netflix hittsars is at the heart of the Cali cartel
despite the fact that the killer of Pablo Escobari was exposed in the second season of the &apos; Narcos &apos; , Netflix sari is far from finished .
the third and fourth season has been validated by the quota intervention service , and the first one has already been produced by a clip of advertising that is stranglehold the horns with new scams .
in the third season , DEA will turn its attention to the richest drug business organisation in the world - the Cali cartel .
they are acting under the leadership of four powerful Christian fathers , such as Ford 500 companies , simply with more bribery to the government and more violent acts .
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela ( Damian Alcazar ) is the leader of the cartel , and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela ( Francisco Denis ) , Pacho Herrera ( Alberto Ammann ) is running links with Mexico and Chepe Santa≈£z London ( Pepe Rapazote ) operates in New York .
Mr Pascali &apos;s return to Javier Penana is seen in the advertised advertising clip , who is recruiting American and Colombian law enforcement assistance in the war against drugs .

according to the UN , Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics .
the head of the UN mission for Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections can only represent the people if all members of society , including women , play a role in them .
Nicholas Haysom , head of the United Nations Assistance Mission , said that hundreds of women stand in local Soviet elections , three women stand as Vice @-@ President and more than 30 % of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; by underlining the importance of the role of women , it is not possible to exaggerate , &quot; he said in a statement made on Wednesday .
the elections can truly represent the people and only be credible if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process .
the local council elections in Afghanistan and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April .
for its part , the Taliban have threatened the electoral process , which coincides with the transitional period in which the role of international military operations becomes advisory .
this year &apos;s elections mark the first time that power is given calmly by one democratically elected government to the next .
according to Mr Haysom , women &apos;s strong role in the success of democracy in Afghanistan increases .
according to an independent Election Commission in Afghanistan , 1.2 million women have registered from 3.6 million registered voters .
the joy of sharing makes every thing more acute , both for large and small .
there is always too little common time , but the trend is a good opportunity to combine meetings , games , proximity and burdens .
and what a convenient solution - no matter where you went in the summer , live animals are always on the verge , and I am anxious to recall with your fine voice : &apos; let us now also be trusted &apos; .
Aelta insulation - It is a very good thing to play a normal gold game , or to bypass the flag of the coastline .
a piece is the foundation for persisting in the form of footwear and darkens - who would then like to take the form of sleeping excesses over the summer ?
it is wonderful to use children instead of a chicken !
first of all , it is secure and convenient , and the difficulty is gradually increasing at the same pace as the forces of trainers .
it will also be possible to take batteries with quite a large number of children .
the child teaches a balance , counts sentences and feels the opportunity to be high and important .
larger children may , at the same time , make their own villages .
the scope of the movement lies in the scarcity of the land and in the cleansing of hands .
keeping the fingers straight , the Palu miniablis properly .
a child can read corps and feel like a lecturer .
the planet is an enormous but hopeless exercise for the child .
however , it is easy to do it .
play @-@ plank : go to a long planguColonn that is repeated .
in fact , it is more difficult than usual , but much easier to do if , in the meantime , a friend can hand his hand .
if you add the burden , you can keep a planade , you can keep a little on the market , and you can walk around it .
an additional difficulty can be made to sit on the hip of a child , but this exercise offers a break for all children .
while the crabs join the sand , the rock , the ash and the cane meat burden , such as the infection , will become triggers .
the child walks to the shoes in such a way that his body is distributed on an equal footing .
for security , you can keep your hands closed .
Overh legs and tears up straight away .
it is possible to fly , bury , strike a balance and be difficult .
the life of a little lecturer is an exhortation if he gets a small deal in every fire .
there is an additional burden in front of your feet .
check that the back door would remain in a neutral position .
it is much easier for children themselves to make crons and plagues .

for the elderly , however , a truly effective whole corporal trend .
Ott ( 10 ) , S√§de ( 8 ) , happiness ( 4 ) were the sources of sport .
from the Philippines at the heart of mopeds in the wider world , or the Anlgkot .
Booked bags are the summer clash , which in recent years has become one piece of hitinerant which , even on the one hand , has had to hang at the top of the hand and to which traders , regardless of its modest origin , have been able to display a price label according to haste .
there is probably one such thing that has existed once in the life of the law and which has not been aroused much emotion .
it simply exists and , if it does not exist , there will be nothing at all .
now , however , lungs are entering a real race , and mopeds have switched their musholes against simple bureaucrats by the summer months .
it is not only a coastline , but today it is also just as popular as a street , and bolder women are knocking it even into the office .
at this point , however , it is worth making it clear whether you are still sitting here in the summer , or whether it is worth postponing a sign and laptops to a little more official .
however , women &apos;s real love of summer has been given by brewers .
for example , if you look at foreign mosques , the first thing is that moeoghurists will first bring their holidays to the local market and buy some beer bags , which are then the truck of a whole holiday period and which go hand in hand in hand , in the market , and also as a friend on the city .
some bloggers are so generous that they are buying bags on the market , selling more wolves and selling them or giving them away to their loyal readers .
in doing so , it is worth pointing out that there is a demand among readers so great that women ( and men ! ) in the real world would probably be involved in each other &apos;s fishing ground in order to obtain the happy owners of some dogs .
in some ways , this madness is also understandable , because the rare are the times when , in fashionism yesterday , it has been possible to buy a couple of pieces of haste for just a few decades .
it is true that white merchants have also discovered a simple way of earning money here , and in so doing more luxury brands also sell bags for a few hundred days and -a thousand euros .
obviously , in order for rich customers not to have to feel easy to die by propelling with some cheap dogs .
it is possible , for example , to buy Dolce &amp; Gabbana hand over EUR 1 000 .
however , a Changel bregkot &apos;s interpretation can be found in the EUR 6 000 circulation chain .
in contrast to most motive buildings , however , lotteries do not inherit at all with a few great mosques , but their story originated in a far more distant way .
it is said that it is far removed from the Philippines , where they have been wearing them wide .
there is , first and foremost , an export business , and there is very often no mention of local dumping .
Admittedly , it is the 14th century of an amusement technique , and it is quite a series of normal corps .
however , since the beer does not have to bundle as much red as corps , they become muscles and other materials that make it more personalised and , by extension , more reactive .
in recent times , for example , there are particularly trendy dogs , where paints or skins have been packaged .
however , copies can , above all , be sent by actress leader , Jane Birkini , the biggest bundled beer of whom had not been seen before .
in particular , he sued a lottery with all sorts of clothing packs and did not even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival a lot .
nowadays , however , the popularity of the applicants does not play a smaller role , either , because caring for them is a hot head and , unlike any other summer productions , it does not have to care for them by means of special funds , but it also deprives the water and the wet .
as is still the case in the case of trendant robbers , apart from classical straits , brands have come out with all possible interpretations .
for example , if they want to be able to obtain a bunch of beers , you can have a bottle or a tiny boom .
at the same time , it is worth remembering that the classical beer will never come from a mosque , but from beer flu .
but what is the classical beer , then ?
for centuries now , a bunch of beers has been classed to resemble repetition of its style has been opened up , and it is short , as well as beers , cripples .

GMB is concerned about investments in the McVitie &apos;s Glasgow plant
the company expects the managers of the mature producer and McVitie to confirm long @-@ term production plans at the company &apos;s Glasgow plant .
according to GMB Scotland , the company has remained silent on the subject of the future of the investment .
more than 500 people are employed in the case of Hobnobsi and the rich know @-@ how and other products .
McVitie &apos;s owner , Plas , said that they had invested more than GBP 5 million over the last few years .
there have been workers and trade union chairmen &apos; who hear the first &apos; when something changes change in the operation of the factory .
in a letter sent to the manager of the company , GMB Scotland , McVitie , addressed a request to &apos; allay concerns about the lack of funding to modernise production lines &apos; .
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy said : &apos; the fact that we do not get clarity from the chief manager of the object on the customs / VIS business needs and the future investment plan makes our members deeply concerned .
several generations of families have worked here , and the labour force is largely made up of the local community and people around Glasgow , an essential pillar for ensuring proper employment in an area where there is high unemployment and social housing .
therefore , in terms of jobs , wages and well @-@ being in the East of Glasgow and Brexti , in the context of a steady drop in living costs and production , a thriving production company in McVitie needs to grow . &quot;
the Pladise representative said : &apos; at the time , he received a letter from GMB Scott only yesterday , and the company responds directly to him because we value active engagement with workers and trade union representatives .
two months ago , there was a regular meeting between the workers in Rabat and the representatives of the GMB , which openly discussed a number of issues .
we then discussed with the workers that , like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we would review our activities now - and this applies to all of our businesses and objects - in order to ensure our competitiveness .
he added : &apos; in recent years , we have invested over GBP 5 million on the site of Customs , most of which have gone to production lines and improvements in procedures .
we fully understand the heritage of customs as a source of production , and if there should be any changes in the activities of the object , workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it . &quot;
did the PSG warn Barcelona three years ago for its approach to Neyra ?
la li regrets its interest in Marco Verratti .
Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not give up in its efforts to attract Neymar in its ranks by offering an offer of GBP 189 million to cover it , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago for its record inauguration ?
this bold approach has opened summer as a transitional window , and Ligue 1 club is ready to demolish more than two times the current world record , which was set in the previous season by returning Paul Pogba back to Manchester Unitetle for GBP 89 million .
once the switchover has been completed , Neyra will , as a result , become the most expensive player in the world , and also the highest paid professional sportsman in the world who will be paid more than GBP 500 000 a week after payment from the PSG .
Barcelona is , of course , angry , not only because of the approach , but also because of the breaking down of Neyra , even though a source close to the leadership of Catalansi confirms that the club has always taken the best care for football since its arrival in Sanps in 2013 .
however , did the PSG President warn the football world about such an opportunity three years ago ?
when Manchester City showed an interest in the conclusion of the Blair Matutis Agreement in 2014 , the Nasser Al @-@ Khelaif strongly warned all clubs who think about recruiting some of the PSG &apos;s best players .
&quot; I am not worried because they know that , when they are concerned about some of our players , we will accept them and contact them , &quot; said Al @-@ Khelaif .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
however , if they try to conclude an agreement with some of our players , they will have to face the consequences . &quot;
Barcelona appears to have moved beyond this limit , as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed interest in the PSG central player , Marco Verratti .
the PSG made it clear that they would not be allowed to leave the field under any circumstances , and that Barcelona could become a setback as a result of this interest by abolishing one of its precious assets in the form of Neyra .
Prime Minister : Ireland wants to build bridges and not borders after Brexitit .
&quot; Brexit is in serious danger of breaking the wool between Northern Ireland and Ireland , Great Britain and Ireland , &quot; warned Varadkar during his first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June .
&quot; I cannot imagine who would benefit from it , &quot; he added .
cross @-@ border infrastructure projects made it possible for the current free movement of people and goods , said Varadkar .
&quot; this is our vision for the future : building bridges , not borders , &quot; she stressed .
she would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union and , as this cannot be achieved , to remain part of the European single market .
it would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom .
another way to make Britain &apos;s departure smoother would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the UK , explained by the Irish Prime Minister .
noting that there was such an agreement with Turkey , Varadkar said : &apos; surely we could have this with Britain . &apos;
the alternative to this would be a return to customs points , which would declare historical division and political failure .
&apos;Building trade , prosperity and peace &apos; said the Prime Minister of Ireland .
he called Brexitit &apos; our generation challenge &apos; and warned that the result could affect every aspect of everyday life in Northern Ireland .
the Irish Prime Minister met the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland when visiting Belfast .
