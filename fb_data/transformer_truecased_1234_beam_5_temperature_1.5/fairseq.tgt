in Estonia and Spain , four members of the Cape Verde group were detained .
according to Mr Posselt , in Spain , the so @-@ called &apos; Cape Verde group &apos; was detained by the police , the leader of the Austrian army , Mrs Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch , who is known in the criminal world under the name of S@@ pin@@ K@@ Cape ro@@ v@@ ski .
Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch arrested in Spain was arrested at a court permit .
yesterday , the Court also took three suspects detained in Estonia .
it is suspected of being members of the so @-@ called &apos; Cape Verde &apos; criminal community aged between 27 and 57 years , who commit mainly drug crimes .
the alleged leader of the criminal community was detained in the province of M@@ ala Mi@@ ris in Spain .
in Estonia , three men were detained as a suspect , one of which has been collected according to data , and two are members of the criminal community .
the data collected indicates that tasks and roles had been clearly divided in the criminal community .
the purpose of criminal activities was to commit drug crimes and thus earn criminal proceeds , &quot; commented on the head of the pre @-@ trial proceedings in criminal cases , Public Prosecutor Va@@ ila Ver@@ te .
&quot; we do not rule out that the circle of suspected criminals is increasing , &quot; the public Prosecutor added .
it is people who have previously been interested in law enforcement authorities , and some of them have been punished for drug crimes .
Ver@@ te stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been high throughout the investigation .
&quot; international cooperation has become common@@ place for us , and this week &apos;s operation shows the success of cooperation , &quot; said Public Prosecutor Ver@@ te .
the head of the Central Criminal Police Service , ago in Le@@ is , said that detention was preceded by an investigation lasting almost one and a half years .
&quot; in the first half of the week , we had a long history of work and , at the same time in Estonia and Spain , suspected of committing crimes , &quot; he said .
it added that central criminal police officers were instrumental in detention in Spain .
for years now , we have good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard .
these de@@ ten@@ tions are yet another message for criminals that we will get them from the other end of Europe . &quot; said Le@@ is .
the information gathered so far makes it clear that men suspected of being free can continue to commit new crimes , which is why the Prosecutor &apos;s office requested their arrest and also approved by the court .
the man arrested in Spain is waiting for his surrender to Estonia .
property , vehicles and cash have been seized for confiscation under this criminal law .
the criminal prosecution procedure is carried out by a central criminal police office for organised crime and led by a public prosecution service .
he was sentenced to blackmail by the Mayor of Tallinn in 2005 and sentenced to five years imprisonment by S@@ Blokland Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch .
in the middle of the last decade , Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ š@@ it was regarded as the second most important in Estonia &apos;s criminal world following the G@@ end@@ ar@@ meri@@ e , Niko@@ lai T@@ aran@@ ko@@ v .
Gu@@ le@@ vi@@ ch , from Cape Verde , appeared in Estonia &apos;s alli@@ ances at the beginning of the 1990s when he started to deal with blackmail in Tallinn .
Ad@@ mittedly , he taxed tax@@ i drivers and women on various ho@@ tels and ordered a monthly ro@@ tation tax on business@@ men .
international joint operations , the confiscation of proceeds of crime and the entry into force of judicial decisions confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective .
for example , the latest court rulings , the eight accused of the so @-@ called D@@ ik@@ ic criminal community , who confis@@ cated EUR 80 000 of criminal proceeds , or the verdict against nine persons that Ig@@ or Ale@@ y@@ ni@@ ko@@ v set up a criminal community in 2006 aimed at illegal trafficking of illegal cigarettes and trafficking in human beings in East Vir@@ u@@ land and southern Estonia .
there has been a total of around EUR 71 500 in recorded crime revenues .
in these criminal cases , it has made progress that police officers exchange information and prosecutors with foreign colleagues on a daily basis and , if necessary , procedures are carried out in any European Union country .
the Civil Liberties Group war@@ ns of Mis@@ sou@@ ris@@ se travel
the National Association for the Ad@@ van@@ dad of the People of C@@ olo@@ red People ( NA@@ Nicaragua ) has warned people of discrimin@@ ating policies and racist attacks in the State .
according to the Group &apos;s statement , &apos; The NA@@ SR issued for the State of Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i State , valid until 28 August 2017 , calls on all African Americans to be particularly attentive and very careful when they move around the country , given the suspi@@ cious racial events that have taken place recently in the state and have also been highlighted here &apos; .
according to NA@@ TA , the group urged both the recent Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i law , which makes it more difficult to win cases of discrimination , and also the fact that the country &apos;s regular lawyers &apos; targets are , to a large extent , minorities .
&quot; citizens &apos; rights are violated .
they are dri@@ f@@ ted because of their sk@@ in colour , beaten or slaugh@@ tered , &quot; &quot; said R@@ os Cha@@ pel , President of NA@@ SR City Sta@@ r .
&quot; we have never received so much complaints before . &quot;
this is the first such warning issued by an organisation for the US state .
the group referred to events such as racist insul@@ ts on mus@@ ici@@ ans &apos; students at Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i University and the death of the 28 @-@ year @-@ old black S@@ and@@ er@@ si .
S@@ and@@ ers died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of this year , after he was beaten in petrol by state and the Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i police cap@@ tured him without being accused of a crime .
furthermore , the report recently compiled by the Chief Prosecutor of Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i , which shows that in the State car drivers &apos; cars are hal@@ ted by 75 % more likely to be hal@@ ted than white drivers .
&apos;@@ For people to be aware and to warn their families , friends and collabor@@ ators about what might happen in Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is , &apos; said Cha@@ pel .
&quot; people need to be ready , whether it is to take fu@@ n money or to inform relatives that they pass through the state . &quot;
according to the latest figures from the F@@ B@@ I programme on hate crime , 2,@@ 100 hate crimes were recorded in the Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is in 2015 , which puts the state in a position of 16 in the country for similar offences .
a travel warning is also a response to the new Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i law , which makes it difficult for the company to refer to the Court of Justice for reasons of discrimination in the quest for housing or work .
the American Civil Liberties Association ( American Civil Guard ) had previously issued travel barriers for T@@ ex@@ as and Ari@@ z@@ ona following the adoption by those states of immigration laws obli@@ ging local authorities to arrest people for immigration offences because , according to AC@@ L@@ U , it increases racial profiling .
usually , travel warnings are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on other countries , but in recent times , interest groups have started to use this measure as a counter @-@ reaction to certain laws and trends within the US .
He@@ pati@@ tis : what could anyone know about the different forms of this difficult disease ?
He@@ pati@@ tis , or inc@@ in@@ eration , can be caused by five different types - A , B , C , D and E @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis virus .
all of these vir@@ uses provo@@ ke a fier@@ ce bur@@ st of the li@@ ver .
however , there is chron@@ ically a he@@ pati@@ tis B and C , which can continue to evolve into a cir@@ r@@ ho@@ p - a li@@ ver cor@@ ps and a li@@ ver cancer .
the epidemi@@ ological Ad@@ vis@@ er of the Health Agency , Ku@@ Suu r , tells us that acute he@@ pati@@ tis disease events are the same in the case of all types of sk@@ im@@ med inc@@ in@@ eration - f@@ ever , fa@@ ti@@ gue , E@@ mb@@ rance , E@@ as@@ per@@ ation , o@@ in@@ eration , air pain , grey emissions , horse mackerel , meat and swe@@ eten@@ ers , as well as s@@ wine and li@@ mas@@ ters .
the last hour of the disease also comes from the popular name of a li@@ tre bur@@ nt by cancer .
children can undergo he@@ pati@@ tis without disease phenomena .
the various types of household inc@@ in@@ eration can only be determined on the basis of laboratory research data .
Al@@ pati@@ tis may turn to chronic he@@ pati@@ tis and run for decades without disease phenomena , which means that the person may not know anything about his or her dangerous illness .
Mr Ku@@ ela@@ r points out various forms of he@@ pati@@ tis and describes their cul@@ mination more closely .
E@@ he@@ pati@@ tis virus infections are spread from a disease to humans and infec@@ t us when eating contaminated food or drinking water , se@@ als , emissions of infected human beings into hands and hands of foodstuffs , soils , objects , contact and consumption of drugs .
a he@@ pati@@ tis was carried out by family members and carers , people suffering from chronic li@@ abilities , sex people with infections , sex men with men , drug users , countries with he@@ pati@@ tis A .
contamination can be prevented by vacc@@ inations , in particular by recommending vaccination for people travelling a lot and at risk of he@@ pati@@ tis A .
in addition , it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements : to was@@ h or dis@@ infec@@ t hands , before using food , to was@@ h all fruit and vegetables .
the he@@ pati@@ tis virus is spreading in connection with man &apos;s blood , in the b@@ read@@ ings of drugs , in th@@ era@@ pe@@ u@@ tic treatment , in au@@ g@@ mentation , in the use of blood @-@ contaminated me@@ ters ( too@@ th@@ me@@ ters , pregnan@@ ator@@ ies ) , in the use of donors &apos; blood , in the sex treatment of he@@ pati@@ tis suff@@ e@@ rers , and in the treatment of he@@ pati@@ tis suff@@ e@@ rers to animals / new@@ born babies .
drug cells , sex partners of infected human beings , sex men with men , new@@ born mothers of infected mother , sick family members and carers , blood and other body liquids are exposed to health care , rescue workers and police officers , as well as people visiting countries with he@@ pati@@ tis B high diseases .
in order to prevent he@@ pati@@ tis , it is possible to vacc@@ in@@ ate people ; in particular , it is recommended to vacc@@ in@@ ate people who are at risk , as well as people suffering from chronic li@@ abilities , HIV infections , sexu@@ ally transmitted diseases and diabe@@ tes .
( b ) he@@ pati@@ tis other preventive measures are : non @-@ use of stran@@ ger hygiene and man@@ bal devices , other sharp tools and sy@@ stal@@ stal@@ stal@@ gia , th@@ era@@ pe@@ u@@ lation and au@@ g@@ mentation , and the use of con@@ d@@ oms in the event of dangerous infections , or prevention of sexual risk taking place .
vaccination against he@@ pati@@ tis V is part of the National immun@@ isation Scheme and free of charge for children in Estonia .
He@@ pati@@ tis C virus is spreading when dealing with the blood of a person who is infected with the disease , when it comes to drugs inc@@ in@@ eration , th@@ era@@ pe@@ u@@ tion , au@@ g@@ mentation , the use of blood @-@ contaminated me@@ ters , the use of donor blood , the person of he@@ pati@@ tis bul@@ let in sex , and he@@ pati@@ tis disease for animals / new@@ born babies .
drug users , sex partners of infected human beings , sex men with men , new@@ born mothers of infected mother , sick family members and carers , blood and other body liquids are exposed to health care , rescue workers and police officers , people with HIV infections , and passengers visiting countries with he@@ pati@@ tis C .
prevention measures for he@@ pati@@ tis C are : non @-@ use of hos@@ pita@@ lity hygiene and man@@ bal devices , other sharp tools and sy@@ stal@@ stal@@ gia , pro@@ phy@@ to@@ isation and au@@ g@@ mentation , and con@@ d@@ oms in the event of a dangerous mix@@ ture of infections .
there is no vaccine against he@@ pati@@ tis C .
d he@@ pati@@ tis contamination is caused by the D@@ he@@ pati@@ tis virus , which goes much further in the presence of the he@@ pati@@ tis B virus .
as a result , D@@ he@@ pati@@ tis B@@ he@@ pati@@ tis , combined with he@@ pati@@ tis B or super@@ inf@@ ants , there are chronic he@@ pati@@ tis B suff@@ e@@ rers .
blood and other body liquids , contamin@@ ated need@@ les and need@@ les , relatives and rarely infected animals are spread in contact with he@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ ins .
the he@@ pati@@ tis hazard tax is chronic he@@ pati@@ tis B infections and non @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis B people .
an effective preventive measure is vaccination against he@@ pati@@ tis B vaccines , which also protects people from HIV infection with he@@ pati@@ tis virus .
e @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses spread by fe@@ u@@ dal means of drinking water and food , including little heat @-@ treated beef , fish and se@@ af@@ ood , donor blood , psy@@ chi@@ ps and more infected animals .
passengers may be infected with high levels of E he@@ pati@@ tis disease in countries .
E@@ he@@ pati@@ tis preventive measures are compliance with the hygiene requirements : to was@@ h or dis@@ infec@@ t hands after slaughter , prior to food preparation and eating , after hospital care .
fruit and vegetables are was@@ hing ahead of consumption , avoiding eating little heat @-@ treated beef , fish and se@@ af@@ ood , drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug consumption .
although , over the last few months , competitors tried four times to printing the Olympic winner , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old F@@ ara@@ h final hu@@ b took power and won 2@@ 6.@@ 4@@ 9.@@ 51 .
Mr F@@ ara@@ h did not think for a long time , drawing the hus@@ band T@@ ania and the children on his own path after the fin@@ alists .
this was a special moment for me .
I very much support my family .
it was wonderful to be with them , saying F@@ ara@@ h to journalists .
F@@ ara@@ h will focus its fifth title competition in London on the gol@@ den du@@ mp of 5 000 and 10 000 me@@ ters .
everything is possible if there are religions in it .
in spite of the title , Mrs Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;@@ Con@@ norm in Da@@ am gold . G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ ti C@@ up , Mr B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri has an extraordinary story of &apos; sy@@ non@@ ymous with one of the works of art at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century in Vienna .
but even more deeply in history .
the inf@@ lam@@ matory sl@@ ope would have lost more influence on the attractive band@@ wid@@ th , the narro@@ w@@ ly subject would have been to be put on top of the extraordinary office allowed in the title .
at the moment , there would be some sort of two books : G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ ti and his pain@@ ting &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; for A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri , and a much greater and more comprehensive history of respected Jewish families and the German occupation , along with its aftermath in Austria .
the first third of the book will lead to a flou@@ ris@@ hing cultural life in the middle of Vienna , who himself ow@@ ed to the Austrian capital , can hardly imagine how life went around R@@ ing@@ st@@ ras@@ s more than a hundred years ago , or how all its head was turned when the climate inva@@ ded .
the concentration of cultural charac@@ ters in one of the rich@@ est cities of Europe , seeing the name familiar with in the book , was felt like a gram in a more cultural way .
however , for example , the fact that S@@ ig@@ mun@@ d Fre@@ ud acted in a city in which there was an un@@ treated ar@@ son and the highest level of suicide in Europe does not add anything to development .
or perhaps , however , every couple of pa@@ tern@@ alistic foot@@ bal@@ ls also add colour to the cultural life of the beginning of the 20th century in Vienna .
dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
in the last decades of the 19th century , the number of Jews in Vienna had explo@@ ded , becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe .
nearly one in ten people in Vienna had a Jewish one during the S@@ aj@@ an@@ di@@ tis .
elderly parents were also new@@ com@@ ers in Vienna , but by the time that A@@ rad mar@@ ried itself twice to open the Czech sugar mag@@ na@@ ad Fer@@ din@@ ja B@@ lo@@ ch and Climate for his famous pain@@ ts , his father had become the seventh largest bank in H@@ ab@@ s@@ bur@@ sts .
however , A@@ de@@ let the whole life that he belon@@ ged to did not lead to .
if you look at &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; , it is difficult to believe that the end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ life infection of this kind of da@@ r of soci@@ alism and dre@@ am@@ t of travel to the Soviet Union .
for 19@@ 07 , when Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ lo@@ ch decided to order his hus@@ band &apos;s luggage from Climate K@@ ong , it was the last six @-@ minute pain@@ ting mak@@ er in Vienna .
at that time , 4 000 kro@@ ons were paid , a quarter of the price of a well @-@ established rural house .
the fact that , in the case of some mar@@ ks@@ men , there was no suspicion of a master bub@@ ble with a mo@@ del@@ ta did not deter sugar mag@@ na@@ at .
as far as the dele@@ tion is concerned , the only certainty is that the relationship between the mo@@ del@@ li and the ar@@ tist created in the course of their work continued until the end of life .
Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;@@ Con@@ nor - Da@@ am gold .
G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ ti Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ship , A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri has an extraordinary record &quot; , Var@@ ra@@ k 2016 , Al@@ do R@@ and@@ maa , who translated English .
shortly before the start of the work with A@@ dele@@ m , the climate had visited Ra@@ ven@@ na San V@@ ita@@ le , and the investi@@ g@@ ators believe that it was precisely there that the wonderful mo@@ sa@@ ic E@@ rin@@ na The@@ o@@ dor@@ t was an idea for the ar@@ tist to make a gol@@ den portfolio known from A@@ dele@@ dele@@ dele@@ dele@@ tion as a mo@@ sa@@ ic .
at the same time ( between 19@@ 07 and 19@@ 08 ) , the climate presented its &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; in Vienna in 19@@ 08 , was born one of the gol@@ den ter@@ restri@@ als .
art his@@ tori@@ ans did not notice the simil@@ arities of two women .
what about nature is Hitler ?
&quot; I think to remember my friend Mr Kli@@ m@@ mer , I am obliged to make him publicly available , &apos; A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer wrote , a few years after the departure of an ar@@ tist ( Kli@@ m@@ t died in February 19@@ 18 ) to the Director of the Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere M@@ use@@ um , and wanted their family &apos;s Kli@@ m@@ ti to go to mus@@ eu@@ ms .
six years prior to the death , the climate had produced one of the A@@ dele@@ s .
he also asked her hus@@ band to leave her two sports courses and four G@@ ustav Kli@@ m@@ ti landsca@@ pes to Gal@@ eri in Austria in February 19@@ 25 .
in his words , she asked Mrs Mari@@ ana and Mr Lu@@ da for her sis@@ ters .
one year after the climate had finished the &apos; Austrian Mon@@ a &apos; annex , Vi@@ in Ka@@ carri@@ art de A@@ ka@@ de@@ mine had attempted to get 17 @-@ year @-@ old Ad@@ ol@@ f Hitler , but fell through the drawing paper .
although sometimes Hitler &apos;s later anti @-@ S@@ emit@@ ism is considered to be the reason for the fact that Jewish profes@@ sors did not accept him in the a@@ ca@@ de@@ mine , none of his cul@@ min@@ ants were actually Jews .
in any case , the role of the Austrian Gal@@ eri , referred to in Mrs Chris@@ t , had changed considerably by 19@@ 39 - it had become important to find decent works for a woman from the rich Jewish arts in Vienna .
Hitler &apos;s personal artistic mus@@ ici@@ ans also served some work at home for A@@ s , but not for the climate .
Si@@ x@@ ty years after the night of Nazi art , a 10 @-@ year @-@ old court dispute began between the Austrian Government and B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer he@@ irs .
it should just be noted at this point that , if the &apos; S@@ novel &apos; is seen in Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere Cas@@ tle in Vienna , the &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; portra@@ yed by A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ er must be tra@@ cked to New York Ne@@ ue Gal@@ eri .
and , before the Vienna War , to read the aforementioned book .
even if you do not plan to look at the climate &apos;s work , because at least my emo@@ tion , following the closure of the book , the subject of Naz@@ is and Jews was sold more than USD 135 million around the ma@@ mal and mode@@ ll A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer .
therefore , not so much a cab@@ in , rather than a ma@@ tri@@ bal fate - and a very moving story .
there was a great deal to facilitate the focus on events on the work done at the beginning of the book by the relatives of Bau@@ ots .
17 @-@ year @-@ old sw@@ im@@ ming in Canada was very close to Estonia &apos;s record .
in eating , gold was very close to the personal cor@@ n of its own 200 m g@@ lu@@ e sw@@ im@@ ming , at 2.@@ 16.@@ 62 .
the Ti@@ pp@@ pp@@ mark dates back to the 17 @-@ year @-@ old festi@@ val of Canadian je@@ wel@@ le@@ ry champi@@ on@@ ship 2.@@ 16.@@ 58 , was bro@@ ke@@ red by Pri@@ it A@@ av@@ ik U@@ ju@@ gation blo@@ g .
gold finally esca@@ ped the A @-@ finishing board of ten years .
in the Fin@@ ally , he went through his distance to 2.@@ 15.@@ 76 and achieved a good 7th seat with a new , high level of excellence .
Estonia &apos;s record ( 2.@@ 15.@@ 13 ) , consisting of A@@ lina K@@ end@@ zi@@ or@@ n , remained just over half a second .
in Estonia , gold rose all the time , and its latest personal top @-@ level mark is the fifth ever result of Estonia .
the young hope of the future lies at 100 m , 200 m and 400 m in bal@@ fire in Canada &apos;s adult Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ships and 200 m@@ m and 400 metres in bun@@ dling .
last week in Tu@@ on@@ to , there was a Canadian champi@@ on@@ ship of je@@ wel@@ le@@ ry , and gold made a successful start there too .
he won 200 m@@ m in bal@@ tu@@ ous sh@@ ut@@ tling with a sil@@ ver me@@ dal of 2.@@ 0@@ 3.@@ 22 .
so quickly , it was sw@@ am@@ ped as a distance campaig@@ ner last in 2008 .
in Estonia , only Estonia &apos;s record publi@@ can , E@@ lina Par@@ ki@@ ka , has distan@@ ced itself more quickly from the Gol@@ den era .
in Canada , a vibran@@ t champion won a top 5@@ 6.@@ 66 of the new Estonian season with 100 m@@ m v@@ ouch@@ ers .
for example , she has been distan@@ ced by a century more quickly by her grand@@ mother , Ker@@ tu ly Al@@ ne@@ k .
he arrived at another 100 m in the open exchange of theat@@ re sw@@ im@@ ming in his personal top @-@ stock , at 1.@@ 0@@ 3.@@ 69 .
for half a long distance , he won only the seventh seat when he s@@ le@@ ep at 2.@@ 17.@@ 31 .
gold is currently leading Estonia &apos;s c@@ and@@ book at four distinct distance .
President T@@ ru@@ mp goes on holiday , critics insu@@ red teet@@ h
the holiday season is in hand - it is also a nonsense for the President of the United States , Donald T@@ ru@@ l .
however , since the T@@ ru@@ mp has so far been one of the President who has taken the most holidays , the critics are we@@ aring teet@@ h .
according to the United States VIS and the CN@@ N , the President intends to have 17 @-@ day leave in a sta@@ tic gol@@ f club in B@@ ed@@ min@@ ster , located in New Jer@@ se@@ ys .
although the President &apos;s leave began yesterday , opponents of T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i have been speaking for weeks now .
they are complaining to the Olympic Games of too frequent cle@@ ans@@ ing .
it is precisely that the President is entitled to spend a weekend in his F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and New Jer@@ sey in cotton .
by the way , the T@@ ru@@ mp has not clean@@ ed the President for its 19@@ 6 working days .
George W@@ . Bush , for example , was able to have 67 days on this holiday , with Barack Obama half less than the T@@ ru@@ mp , but only 21 days .
however , it tends to fo@@ ol@@ ish things quickly .
ten days after he became President , when he received the T@@ ru@@ mp , he said , &apos; 60 minutes &apos; , that there would be no time left for him to leave , because a great deal needs to be done .
he also expressed his outra@@ ge about Barack Obama &apos;s holiday three years ago .
on Twitter , the current President wrote : &apos; while Obama is on holiday , plays gol@@ f , the brak@@ es and the j@@ ä@@ ss@@ ist concer@@ ts are going on , the journalists in exile are pul@@ ling their heads out &apos; .
according to white house officials , 17 @-@ day gol@@ f club visits to pol@@ len do not exist .
instead , it is officially referred to as &apos; working leave &apos; , during which T@@ ru@@ l does not have the time to read the Olympic Games or for other sporting activities .
in addition , there was also a second reason for working leave .
it is precisely that there would be a change in the western prison system in the White House , which is why the entire staff had to leave it .
the West Bank is also located in the O@@ val@@ ka@@ ker and other presidential premises .
&quot; I do not believe that any one of you would like to be in the West in August if there were 38 degrees and no con@@ glom@@ era@@ tes , &quot; said L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters , the white house spokes@@ person , who stressed that the President would continue to work on holiday .
where President T@@ ru@@ mp is going to spend 17 days , you get an idea of video .
blocking critics on Facebook do not apply to public office if you do not tolerate voters &apos; criticism .
the father of our country knew so much about disadvantaged media coverage .
the Americans lo@@ ved Mr Washington , but the newspapers did not take a long time to bul@@ l him for everything , from internal politics to his political principles .
of course , he was anno@@ yed by the criticism .
but he did not force his critics to remain silent .
because , in the year 17@@ 83 , Washington said that &apos; freedom of expression may be taken away from us , and in dar@@ k@@ ness and silence we may be chaired by sheep on slaugh@@ ter@@ houses &apos; .
this brings me to Mar@@ y@@ land ku@@ ber@@ ner Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who is struggling to be more in Washington .
they have blocked and era@@ sed at least 450 people who expressed their views on their official Facebook page .
and at the beginning of the week , the American Union for the Freedom of Citizens ( American Civil Nations Union ) addressed him to the courts for this reason .
the officials of the Ku@@ ber@@ ner &apos;s officials turned the action into empty and web commen@@ ta@@ tes into &apos; who is interested ? &apos; .
&apos;@@ This is just Facebook , &apos; many people said .
but that counts .
and this is particularly important when it comes to a man like Ho@@ gan .
it is an overwhelming democratic state with ama@@ zing popular Re@@ publi@@ can t@@ oura@@ ge .
his approval percen@@ tages are the second highest ranking among the country &apos;s 50 Governor .
Ho@@ gan is not a reac@@ tive sight .
it has led the state firmly and remains strictly firm on its own principles .
in addition , she has used her as a major tool for communicating with his constituents quite deliberately on Facebook , presenting , for the first time after the chemical pil@@ l , for example , his bitter head .
therefore , a public forum with a formal label , managed by the staff who pay taxpayers &apos; dollars from Kenya , is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
Ho@@ gan &apos;s press representative , Ame@@ lia Ch@@ ess , defended in an interview given to Washington Posselt the behaviour of the Governor , arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than mode@@ recasting .
however , it is far too easy to taste the picture of Internet brow@@ sing on the Internet , spa@@ m@@ mers or people full of hatred .
the post spoke to a number of people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and that is precisely what they are really the people who communicate with their elected leaders : the user , the owner of the company and the pas@@ tor , and not Internet controls .
they all said that their comments were respec@@ table , thought @-@ out and not ro@@ p@@ aste .
Pas@@ tor quoted the Bi@@ ble in his post , urging the K@@ ho@@ gan Catholic movement .
a lawyer from Mar@@ y@@ lan , Bo@@ wi@@ e , L@@ ak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ra@@ man , did not insti@@ gate hatred , but rather hate crimes .
&quot; I said , poli@@ tely , that I am disappointed because he has not responded to hate crime or other recent news , &quot; he wrote the edit@@ orial news story in his country .
&quot; I also do not like the idea that how many people comment on the same subject , some of them call it an indifferent collective effort instead of acknowledging that it is a great deal of citizens &apos; concerns . &quot;
what the Governor &apos;s officer called &apos; targeted spa@@ m attack &apos; would probably invite others to &apos; public support &apos; .
the age of Facebook makes it easy to reconcile messages by simply blocking criticism or dele@@ ting negative comments .
it is much cleaner than before when it came to sending out workers to do the same , so that they aggre@@ gate newspapers with critical edit@@ orial head@@ lines and bur@@ n them or arrest the prote@@ sters and force them to remain silent .
however , that is exactly what is happening now , just digita@@ lly .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official criticised for making Facebook and other social media too@@ th@@ less .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i has accused Twitter users who have been blocked from Twitter .
one of the first key judgments on this matter was made last week in Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
Mr James C. C@@ ac@@ her@@ is , the US civil servan@@ t , decided in Alexand@@ ria that Mr Lou@@ d@@ oun@@ i &apos;s Board of supervisors violated the first revision of the Constitution when he blocked the vo@@ ter on his Facebook page .
in K@@ tu@@ ck@@ y , the Governor Mat@@ t B@@ ev@@ in@@ it ( R ) also visited AC@@ L@@ U Facebook and Twitter for use .
this should not be so difficult .
there was a similar impact on affordable postal costs in Washington than on the Internet .
between 17@@ 76 and 18@@ 00 , the number of newspapers and anon@@ ymous wri@@ ters s@@ tun@@ ned his way of leadership .
even then , Washington had to deal with anon@@ ymous controls .
people wrote letters to newspapers from pseu@@ do @-@ uni@@ on@@ y@@ ms such as Ju@@ ric@@ ol@@ a , Val@@ eri@@ us , Bel@@ is@@ ari@@ us and Por@@ ti@@ us , making the decisions of Washington rec@@ ou@@ p .
according to historical documents which have been compiled as part of the Water @-@ based George Washington magaz@@ ine , he bur@@ ned his c@@ abinet with petitions criticising his views on tw@@ inning , trade and shipping agreements with Britain .
but he did not force them to remain silent .
freedom of expression , differences of opinion and debates are fundamental pillars of our country .
and proper management means accepting it .

the people of Northern Ireland , who were in the vic@@ inity of Ar@@ cher@@ field L@@ in@@ ony last year in the run @-@ up to the last round of Mr Paul E@@ al@@ na , have sta@@ ged into a new place of engagement , and will play the role of the foun@@ der of the club and executive leader , Jer@@ ry S@@ hari@@ d , rather than his own .
&quot; I saw R@@ ena@@ iss@@ ance C@@ lu@@ b built , and now we can see how the club is blow@@ ing in full gl@@ ory , &quot; said R@@ aff@@ er@@ ty .
&quot; players see the path in their best shape ; it is in a perfect state .
Jer@@ ry has done an excellent job in setting up this place .
she is a keen supporter of gol@@ f games and proud of what has been achieved here .
this will allow an excellent presentation of the path . &quot;
Ing@@ an ever expects to be able to defend the title for the first time , even though the man has won both European Toubon and the European challenge Tou@@ ril during his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; this sends a very special feeling , &quot; said Se@@ th@@ por@@ tis , a committed player .
&quot; I was unable to defend my Ex@@ t@@ rema@@ du@@ ra O@@ range , because it was taken away from my competition calendar one year after my victory .
it is mathema@@ tical to come back to this chic@@ ken .
this is an excellent place to play a gol@@ f .
I remember the memor@@ ies of last year , for me and for my wife , Mrs Shar@@ on , last year &apos;s victory was special .
it was a very special period that we will always bear in our hearts . &quot;
G@@ ary Or@@ r will return to the competition once again on his country &apos;s soil , who joined the European Works Agency later this year , when he became 50 .
this is his first event in Scotland since the participation of A@@ ber@@ de@@ en Bank in 2013 .
&quot; it is always a little more important to play at home , &quot; said Hel@@ en@@ s@@ bur@@ gh &apos;s man Or@@ r .
&quot; Denmark did well , but at the same time it was interesting to add .
I have enjoyed playing again enormously and quite rightly demonstrated gol@@ f games .
I am pleased that things are going on so far . &quot;

&quot; no one da@@ res to go around after 5 o &apos;@@ clock in the village , &quot; he says .
it is a rare pilot in the country of Papua Bauer , a former Dutch col@@ ony which was integrated into Indonesia in 19@@ 68 following a referendum which only made 1 0@@ 26 older people voting hand in front of the forces .
in the direction of moving towards a rapid Y@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta government , which liber@@ ated the Dutch people from the sup@@ rema@@ cy of power , it will continue to keep the region under strong control , preventing foreign journalists and human rights supervisors .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into P@@ ope and Western P@@ ope , so independent Papua New Guinea remained eastern of the island .
in order to be able to achieve this , the majority is both a remote and abandoned place , and a 5 @-@ hour journey from the capital of the province of Ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ur@@ u will have to fly to N@@ abi@@ mel for 90 minutes and then pass through the ren@@ tal car .
there is no public transport .
the city of approximately 19 000 inhabitants is made up of c@@ olum@@ ns surrounded by car@@ mb@@ s and covers la@@ in@@ ous iron ro@@ ckets , which have been transformed into different ru@@ ins .
very few indicators have undertaken a journey here , not to mention journalists , nor have there been almost any foreigners here .

Papua Indonesia is the poorest province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and inf@@ ant mortality and il@@ literacy statistics are one of the worst in Asia .
however , it is also a gol@@ den country in Indonesia .
just 100 km away from P@@ ani@@ a@@ o , which is a mountainous province of 153 000 inhabitants of New Jer@@ sey , the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , G@@ ras@@ berg , which belongs to a company operating in P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x@@ is F@@ bet@@ report Mc@@ Mor@@ an .
approximately USD 3.@@ 1 billion worth of gold and cop@@ ies were extra@@ cted from F@@ re in 2015 alone .
in addition , it is possible to con@@ tend with supplies of raw wood , worth an estimated USD 78 billion .
however , these ri@@ ches are the source of the suffering of boats , as they result in the suff@@ oc@@ ating presence of a powerful Iranian army .
the New York Times study in 2005 showed that F@@ re@@ export in the years 1998 @-@ 2004 paid local troops and military units about USD 20 million , including up to USD 150 000 to a single victim .
the attempts made by speculators to ensure greater autonomy threaten this gol@@ den h@@ all , and they are se@@ am@@ lessly bet@@ ra@@ yed .
according to human rights activists , more than 500 000 boats have been killed since 19@@ 59 and thousands more have been ra@@ ped , tortured and imprisoned by the Iranian army .
according to the Committee on Human Rights in Asia , the massacre in the moun@@ tains in Papua arh@@ us in the 1970s was the dimension of genocide .
last year alone , more than 3@@ 900 peaceful prote@@ sters were arrested by the Colom@@ bian police in the region .
the 2016 report of Bir@@ s@@ b@@ ane &apos;s Grand Ar@@ ch@@ bis@@ ho@@ p will contain testi@@ mony to the atrocities committed last year , such as extra@@ judicial executions , torture ( rape and electric blow@@ ers ) and the brutal repression of peaceful protests .
&quot; it is difficult to read the number of victims , as such incidents take place every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , the investi@@ g@@ ator of Human Rights Watch , Indonesia .
there have been even stronger bloc@@ ka@@ des , as Papua natural resources have led to the influx of new set@@ tle@@ rs from elsewhere in Indonesia .
83 % of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians , but demo@@ graph@@ ics are changing , as there are black economic migrants coming from the islands in Indonesia from Bar@@ va , Kal@@ im@@ an@@ tan , Su@@ ma@@ tra and S@@ ula@@ w@@ si .
popular can@@ te@@ ens are sold in the Qu@@ e@@ en and mixed vegetables by ga@@ do @-@ ga@@ do @-@ ga@@ do , which are ser@@ ted along with ground level .
they cannot compete with them .
&quot; migrants started selling hero@@ es and vegetables more cheap@@ ly than local boats on the traditional market , &quot; said Androulla Andersson , born in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old bee@@ kee@@ per who came to the capital of the province , Ja@@ y@@ applause .
&quot; Sy@@ ri@@ ans Fron@@ ma@@ ma @-@ Ma@@ ma &#91; women &#93; pain@@ ting boats are therefore losing their market share . &quot;
the President of Indonesia , J@@ ok@@ o W@@ id@@ o@@ do , who is well known to the people as Jo@@ ko@@ w , promised in his election campaign in 2014 to deal with these inequalities and human rights violations in P@@ ope .
the former pu@@ b won 27 constitu@@ encies , including P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , on its way to the presidential Pal@@ ace of J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta .
however , there has been very little change in the P@@ ope and the local feel chea@@ ted .
&quot; our hearts have been broken because , in 2014 , we voted in favour of Jo@@ ko@@ w in the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes with regard to the restoration of justice , &quot; says apprenticeships .
in fact , just two months after Jo@@ ko@@ w took office in October , P@@ ani@@ a@@ i was in a low position .
on 7 December 2014 , 11 children in the Ty@@ ro@@ ta@@ il s@@ tun@@ ned on Christmas when two Indon@@ esi@@ an soldiers beau@@ ted blin@@ ded blin@@ dness .
born children said to them that they should include front lights .
according to the local pas@@ tor Y@@ a@@ ve@@ dt T@@ eba@@ i , one of the soldiers insul@@ ted their voting tone and returned later to four soldiers .
according to the victims and specta@@ tors , in the words of the victims , in the &apos; drink @-@ driving force &apos; soldiers hun@@ ted children and dece@@ ived them with their gun@@ s .
then one of the soldiers was shot among children .
one child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ u@@ li@@ an@@ us Ye@@ im@@ ot , was so bru@@ tally beaten that he fell into the home .
a few hours later , a close electoral Commission building was bur@@ nt down , and things went further next day .
some 1 000 young people came together in order to claim justice to the local police department and the military management centre .
they carried me@@ e pa@@ go tri@@ cks of wa@@ ita @-@ tan@@ ts@@ u during which poultry s@@ ongs were bu@@ ried and bu@@ ried .
some prote@@ sters started to le@@ cture the police and the military .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen the crow@@ d shows resistance more than three times , let them down , &apos; the official document , which has seen a magaz@@ ine of time but has not been issued to local media publications , says it was said .
the elderly city of Ke@@ go Ko@@ to , Ye@@ re@@ mi@@ as Ka@@ y@@ me ( 56 ) , has felt a threat and called for peace to be maintained by asking the people to go home .
no one had the will to listen .
&quot; returning me to the left , I was suddenly shot in touch , &quot; he said , in a magaz@@ ine magaz@@ ine in his private col@@ ours , at the blood of a t@@ ree .
we still do not know who the fire was , but it says that in the month it came from soldiers &apos; ri@@ gs .
&quot; there was a lot of people , a great deal in the House , &apos; adds him .
the local man , Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w , was shot on his gun@@ s three times , according to a coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or .
&quot; let me wait on him and I watched him through as a body to make sure that he is with him , &quot; said the magaz@@ ine holidays syn@@ n@@ ically in Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who use only one name , like many charac@@ ters .
&quot; I have seen that he has died ... S@@ novel le@@ w . &quot;
Dr Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , Chief Police officer , said to the repor@@ ters that he was subject only to the security of his department because it was attacked .
&quot; we need to defend ourselves when we are threatened to kill , &quot; said Vice @-@ President P@@ ud@@ jo S@@ ul@@ is@@ ti@@ yo , the spokes@@ man for the Police Service , in 2015 .
&quot; this is a matter of life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young prote@@ sters were killed and many injured .
the news about the killings arrived in J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta@@ il only on the next day .
three weeks later , Jo@@ ko@@ wi Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ ras held a passion@@ ate speech in which he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and allowed abuses to be dealt with in P@@ ope .
&quot; I want to resolve this case immediately so that it will never happen again in the future , &quot; he said .
security minister W@@ ir@@ an@@ to said in October 2016 that he would establish an alternative mechanism for dealing with human rights crimes .
however , almost immediately the ex@@ cus@@ es followed .
&quot; most crimes took place a long time ago .
some of them took place in the 1990s and the early 200@@ 0s .
the point is that we are committed to resolving these crimes , but we have to follow certain processes , &apos; he said .
however , when he talked about the magaz@@ ine on 5 June in J@@ ak@@ ar@@ tas , W@@ ir@@ an@@ to with@@ drew his words by saying that he had no intention of setting up a mechanism to deal with complaints in P@@ ope .
instead , he said that &apos; everything would be resolved by law &apos; .
the W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , who has been accused by the United Nations of crimes against human rights in relation to more than 1 000 deaths in East Timor during the 1999 bloody referendum on independence , said that 11 crimes against human rights had already been resolved in P@@ ope , including what happened in P@@ ani@@ a@@ is .
the families of the victims of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i adopted such asser@@ tions with g@@ loom .
&quot; I have been inter@@ cep@@ ted four times over the last three years , but no progress has been made , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&quot; I am ti@@ red . &quot;
he says that he is still living in fear for years later .
&apos;@@ I am afraid , &apos; he says .
&quot; I am afraid that the army will arrest me , I am afraid I will be shot . &quot;
his bro@@ ther d Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us confirmed that the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i are afraid of this incident .
he said that he was beaten by the army after helping to bur@@ y four victims .
&quot; I had to be looked by the army after bur@@ ying the bodies , &apos; he says .
executions have not stopped .
on Tuesday , the inhabitants of the Egyptian police were shot in the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i neighbouring P@@ ani@@ a@@ am in D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ i .
one person was killed and 17 w@@ ounded , including children , when he went to war between the inhabitants of the village and the head of the construction company , who refused to transport an un@@ conscious man to hospital .
the male people , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ an@@ us D@@ ou@@ w , who dro@@ w@@ ned ne@@ ar@@ by rivers trying to fish , died on their way to hospital .
the recent inhabitants of villages prote@@ sted on a construction site before the company office .
according to the police , the people of the villages were le@@ c@@ turing poli@@ ce@@ men to stoning , the latter having responded to warning bel@@ ls .
however , according to local reports , mobile Bri@@ tons ( Iranian military police ) started to shoo@@ t at the people by killing one person .
&quot; we were in great panic , we are afraid of reven@@ ge , &quot; said Win@@ dows 29 years of Dom@@ ing@@ da Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives close to the hospital and saw injured in@@ sec@@ ts .
&quot; I have dece@@ ived myself in my house for two days . &quot;
Mr D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ i &apos;s Parliament has called for the prosecution of the police officers involved and the withdrawal from the area of the police &apos;s mobile Bri@@ gade .
P@@ ani@@ a@@ i has always been a problem for the Government of Indonesia .
the lack of meaningful development fe@@ eds the dis@@ satisfaction of the me@@ als , m@@ oni , dan@@ s and da@@ m@@ mal tri@@ bes living in Papua hal@@ j@@ enda@@ va .
many of them have signed up to the army of insur@@ gen@@ ts who , according to themselves , defend the rights of pa@@ in@@ ants , ju@@ mping attacks and kid@@ napp@@ ings among Iranian soldiers .
some V@@ PL leaders come from P@@ ania , including Ta@@ di@@ us Y@@ o@@ g and Daniel Y@@ u@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , over the last few years , under the pretext of defending the sovereignty of a state , the army has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of people .
some of them will never happen again .
among the people of Papua Islands , P@@ ani@@ ans are known as &apos; tragic forgotten place &apos; .
poverty fe@@ eds dis@@ satisfaction .
the small ri@@ ce that is sold in the majority is too expensive to buy locally .
Lei@@ b is the same un@@ at@@ tain@@ able .
the people themselves culti@@ vate all their food , mainly the Bah@@ á , as well as some fruit and vegetables .
farming is the work of women , each of whom is able to care for four or five ru@@ ins .
they usually hold most of the recei@@ pt to the family ; the rest is sold on the local market .
only 10 000 Indon@@ esi@@ an premises ( 75 cents ) are paid by the 10 Bah@@ a &apos;@@ s .
over time , economic inequalities have been exacerbated between heavy boats and new migrants , who have arrived a great deal from the opening up of new routes at N@@ ab@@ ire airport .
the few jobs that exist go to better educated and more prosperous migrants .
speculators themselves often do not have the capital or the necessary skills to do a competitive business .
&quot; young people are not interested in leaving the village because there is neither jobs nor money , &quot; says John Go@@ ba@@ i , President of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i tri@@ bal Council .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from the P@@ ope .
in addition , there will be severe restrictions on foreign media .
French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le L@@ ong@@ cha@@ mp were ex@@ tradi@@ ted earlier this year because &apos; they did not follow the relevant practices &apos; , even though they had a rare film permit .
according to Vice @-@ President P@@ ich@@ m K@@ ine , Human Rights Watch , Vice @-@ President of the Asian department , the election pledges made by Jo@@ ko@@ w have not been carried out to lift the restrictions placed on repor@@ ters to promote transparency and development .
&quot; journalists attempting to make reports from the most peaceful provinces in the East of Indonesia and from the Western P@@ ope threaten the rejection and black@@ list of Madagascar , &quot; said in his statement .
the lack of a satellite view of the press means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esi@@ an Government is largely limited to its immediate neighbours .
in March , six of the Pacific countries , Bahrain , Na@@ ur@@ u , B@@ ela@@ u , Tu@@ pain , the Mar@@ shall Islands and the Sol@@ om@@ on Islands alike , urged the United Nations Human Rights Council to examine &apos; various large @-@ scale crimes &apos; in P@@ ole , including the shooting of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
the same countries have historically supported V@@ PL .
Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r k@@ iss , spokes@@ woman at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia , with@@ drew charges from the group , saying to the press : &apos; in Indonesia , democracy and freedom of the press still exist so that evidence of cases against human rights is difficult to bur@@ y &apos; .
the local people want more foreign governments to heed .
when the Dutch official delegation visited Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ rat on 4 May , the country &apos;s Ambassador for Human Rights , Mr Van B@@ arti@@ ga , the local people inter@@ cep@@ ted the meeting , but wanted to be anon@@ ymous , according to the source , to remain silent , urging : &apos; we want freedom &apos; .
new presidential elections will take place in Indonesia in 2019 , but boats do not believe that they will vote again in favour of Jo@@ ko@@ w .
&quot; Jo@@ ko@@ w is a man with good intentions , but surrounded by people involved in the shooting of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , &quot; says Ho@@ ba@@ i , President of the tri@@ bal Council .
he wants to give Jo@@ ko@@ w the impression that not only do the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i continue to live under the threat posed by the pre@@ da@@ tory army , but they are hard hit by poor education and health services .
according to Go@@ ba@@ i , the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , like other boats , regard their voice to Jo@@ ko@@ w as the debt that they have to pay .
&quot; they do not need money , they want justice , &quot; he says .
in spite of threats and intimidation , the families of the victims of the fire in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i were able to cope with yet another symb@@ oli@@ cally controversial response by Yemen , which swe@@ pt into one of the victims &apos; bodies of the police force and the army to the land in question .
knowing that justice can never be put on its feet , they at least do not allow those responsible to forget their crimes .
&quot; one of our family members was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a shot .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
ne@@ go@@ ver of Du@@ ba@@ i Tor@@ ch &apos;s pil@@ ots came under the car@@ pet for the second time .
on Friday , one of the world &apos;s biggest residential stor@@ ms in Du@@ ba@@ i was ea@@ ten , forcing hundreds of people to fle@@ e this 3@@ 37 me@@ tre of age and a 79 @-@ stro@@ ke construction .
this is the second fire which , for just two years , has been ra@@ va@@ ged by a high level of radiation called the Tu@@ rin case , or the T@@ him@@ vi@@ ku@@ r .
the building was evacu@@ ated , none of the injuries were reported and there were any direct causes of fire .
&quot; we s@@ le@@ ep and thre@@ w out the fires and people &apos;s fears .
let us wait for the t@@ our , and it took about 10 minutes for us to get down to the 50@@ th order , &apos; said to Re@@ u@@ ter@@ ans one of the people who called themselves George .
according to Du@@ ba@@ i &apos;s civil protection officers , fire @-@ fighters were also deleted at around 4 o &apos;@@ clock in the morning at local inter@@ vals ( 00@@ .00 G@@ MT ) and hi@@ jac@@ ked the building .
the government said that it was working to ensure shelter for those affected .
this incident can once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on high external soil worldwide .
a study carried out by the Tu@@ rin Management Board after the fire in 2015 found that the most damage had been suffered by f@@ ab@@ ric@@ s such as de@@ cor@@ al panels and insu@@ lation on foreign soil .
the British police have said that they believe that the insu@@ lation of the London G@@ ren@@ portfolio T@@ ow@@ er , together with its amb@@ assa@@ dors , could have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire that took place there in June , killing almost 80 people .
see : these phones are likely to receive sales cards in the autumn
it is time for tele@@ visions and cy@@ nic@@ ism , because the telephone manufacturers will then disclose their new models of excellence .
Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , Hu@@ aw@@ ei P@@ 10 and S@@ ony X@@ peri@@ a Pre@@ mi@@ um came to sale in the spring , and new h@@ it@@ t telep@@ hon@@ es are expected in the autumn .
according to the Tele@@ 2 marketing and sales Director , Christian Se@@ mother , today &apos;s flagship ships are characterised by an innovative design , an outrageous s@@ hand@@ n@@ ner , the ser@@ ser @-@ servan@@ i 4@@ K resolution , a screen and a ultra @-@ fast process .
Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , in the world of technology , was a major source of attra@@ ction , which is also at the top of Estonia &apos;s smar@@ t@@ phones &apos; sales table .
the autumn will allow cle@@ r@@ gy suff@@ e@@ rers to fly even more h@@ aste , more resilient a@@ da@@ ge , better camer@@ as and greater water and customs security .
he added that , on the basis of rum@@ ours , you can already specu@@ late and predict four top @-@ level models , which are likely to con@@ qu@@ er today &apos;s sales tables .
these four &quot; smart phones top &quot; models will reach the boys in the autumn of this year .
expected i@@ P@@ hone 8 and i@@ P@@ hone 8 Plus should reach boys by mid @-@ September .
however , there is a lot to be gained from the new Apple model , which can and can be done .
if i@@ P@@ hone 7 did not lead to significant differences between i@@ P@@ hone 6@@ s , Apple &apos;s 10th birth@@ day is expected that the new model will be completely different from previous ones .
there has been talk of four col@@ ours : black , White , Swe@@ ep and ch@@ ro@@ mi@@ um .
one of the elements of the new design is probably the screen , which covers all the telephone front , has been lost at home , and fingerprints have been built into the scre@@ ens .
Mr J@@ on@@ y@@ I@@ ve , Director of Apple &apos;s design , is calling for the new i@@ P@@ hone model to look like a glass .
there has also been talk of an i@@ P@@ hone version .
in addition to the head @-@ up , the un@@ man@@ age@@ able charging and a more high @-@ quality camer@@ a , we can expect faster A@@ 11 processes .
this is certainly one of the most expected smart phones in the year .
the outs@@ ourcing of the new model G@@ ala@@ x@@ y Spring 8 will begin on 23 August .
there have been a lot of rum@@ ours about what new G@@ ala@@ x@@ y Plan 8 will look like .
Ad@@ mittedly , even more business users are meant , and S pen allows even greater fun@@ ction@@ alities .
the telephone fund should have two camer@@ as , one of which is a la@@ in@@ ur@@ t and one with a narrow view to tele@@ objects .
at the moment , no one yet knows what the two sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ ums are capable of , but in any case this is the first test of Sam@@ sun@@ g , which is certainly comparable to i@@ P@@ hone 8 for quality .
however , we are eag@@ er@@ ly awaiting 23 August .
although Nokia has sold sales this year with three smart phones headed by Nokia 6 , their flagship vessel , Nokia 8 , which is already presented on 16 August , is still missing .
we look forward to a screen stret@@ ching from 5.@@ 3 to the bottom line and to an extraordinarily fast Qu@@ al@@ com@@ m S@@ scarce dra@@ g@@ on 8@@ 35 processes and a more resilient tan@@ de@@ m .
in the case of Nokia , there is also talk of alu@@ mini@@ um cor@@ ps and significant levels of water and customs security IP@@ 68 .
similarly to Sam@@ su@@ ng@@ one , Nokia &apos;s new model has two s@@ tun@@ ning camer@@ a , an opti@@ mist produced by the company Z@@ e@@ iss .
once the S@@ ony firm flagship has been X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um so far , the manufacturer has confirmed that in the near future at least two smar@@ t@@ phones with even more innovative fun@@ ction@@ alities will be added .
we are waiting for a smar@@ t@@ phone that is a little more modest than X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um , but at least as good or better .
on the new S@@ ony model , it has been specu@@ lated that its screen is at least hot .
what the reality is , we can already see right now , because traditionally S@@ ony has unve@@ iled its autumn flag vessel at IF@@ A , which will take place between 1 and 6 September this year .
according to trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts le@@ ak@@ ed by telephone calls , T@@ ru@@ mp of Mexico pressed for payment of the border wall .
the Washington post unve@@ iled telephone calls between US President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i and Mexic@@ an and Austr@@ alian Heads of State .
on 27 January , En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ et@@ o , the Mexic@@ an President , went on a telephone call to put an end to public pro@@ cla@@ mation that he did not intend to pay for the proposed border wall .
the American President warned him about his public condemnation of the wall , saying : &apos; you must not say this to the press &apos; .
the T@@ ru@@ bun@@ ch made a promise in his presidential campaign to build the wall and age on the southern borders of the United States that Mexico would pay for this project .
trans@@ cri@@ p@@ tors were also published in his first speech with the Austr@@ alian Prime Minister , Malcolm Turmes , reve@@ aling intense debate .
T@@ ru@@ mp said to Tur@@ une@@ le that the agreement whereby the United States takes refugees to Australia is &apos; ridiculous &apos; , &apos; ner@@ v@@ ous &apos; and &apos; ru@@ m &apos; . he stated that the agreement that was made during the Obama Administration would give him the impression &apos; guide &apos; because he has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States .
the T@@ ru@@ mp ended the speech by telling the Tur@@ une@@ le that &apos; this was the day &apos;s most un@@ pleasant speech &apos; .
the national court did not take a complaint against the city of O@@ C MR@@ P Li@@ ine in the event that the city of Tar@@ tu rejected their offer for the procurement of bus and coach transport between July 2019 and 20@@ 29 .
this is a letter rejected by An@@ four A@@ pu@@ tin A@@ pu@@ tin , Head of the Tar@@ tu Civil Service , because the offer did not meet the requirements .
this is the procurement of public transport in Tar@@ tu city for the period from 0@@ 1.@@ 0@@ 7.@@ 2019 to 3@@ 0.@@ 0@@ 6.@@ 20@@ 29 .
MR@@ P city Li@@ ine referred to the Supreme Court of Justice to the Dis@@ tri@@ ct Court ruling .
the national court did not act .
although many people in the social media complain that their night is distur@@ bed by the cut off from the We@@ ek@@ ise F@@ esti@@ val , and the entire city is full of scre@@ ens , there are also many who do not have to say any bad words about a permanent festi@@ val .
I am even positively surprised that the brak@@ es were so poli@@ te in the shop .
I did not see any mis@@ representation or cour@@ tes@@ y .
even so , I saw &apos; , there is a wonderful wave .
after all , it is a good thing that there will be , there will be , and there will be joy , of the Per@@ sia , which has sta@@ yed like winter , &apos; , he will gla@@ dly add .
there is no cra@@ dle in the ty@@ rann@@ y of R@@ ann@@ y .
if , when living in the city of the centre , he was still listening to playing music , then the music has not yet arrived at his ho@@ mework .
&quot; but I hope I will hear , &quot; he will gla@@ dly say .
in Ag@@ nes , who talked with a fire , it also says that the Grand F@@ esti@@ val is rather a good thing for Per@@ ter - it will make a significant contribution to the turnover of local merchan@@ ts .
he also welcomes the fact that so many houses have come to the visitors &apos; capital in the summer .
the woman of Pe@@ ol@@ ives does not matter .
even though I am no longer on the coast , it is nice that rand has revi@@ ved .
and it is good that the people are moving , and this has been the case three times &apos; , a woman says .
the first time was probably a little worse .
then perhaps there were complaints , he is wondering .
it is true , however , that , according to him , what is happening on the ground is normal for the capital cities in the summer .
&quot; this We@@ ek@@ ise is a very good pro@@ ph@@ mo for our little city , says Har@@ ri , who is on the park .
life and m@@ ö@@ ll have also failed to bur@@ y his el@@ ur@@ t@@ m .
but for it ?
we should all pull together .
think about how it would be better to communicate between nations .
after all , music does not mis@@ lead .
this does not happen , although I live near it .
&quot; good people can save and have nothing to do , &quot; he says .
visitors coming to Slovenia are , according to him , cour@@ tes@@ y .
&quot; of course , they have joined them a little , but young people are young people and hero@@ es God - give but be people and we can do it ! &quot;
painful residents have moved away from somewhere by then , whether to relatives or to acqu@@ ain@@ tan@@ ces .
&quot; however , in general , the festi@@ val has a positive impact on life - people like such me@@ lu , and they are talking to the University with the children of Per@@ sia .
his family , too , does not dis@@ rupt the festi@@ val model , even though last year it went even further than it was today .
last summer , we heard more .
we live outside the city itself , that in fact there is a long way away from the River Per@@ ter , &apos; he talks .
Pe@@ ar@@ son cuts 3 000 more jobs and reduces dividen@@ ds to revita@@ lise business
the British educational company Pe@@ ar@@ son said on Friday that he will cut 3 000 more jobs and reduce his interim dividend by 72 % , thereby launching another restructuring programme to deal with business @-@ threatening distress .
these jobs , which , according to John F@@ all@@ on , are likely to be made redundant at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , add to the 4 000 posts lost during the previous restructuring process .
Pe@@ ar@@ son announced in May his plan to cut expenditure by another GBP 300 million ( USD 3@@ 94 million ) under the third expenditure reduction programme in order to try to revita@@ lise businesses that have been hit by the transition to high @-@ speed digital learning .
the company , which agreed to sell last month at Pen@@ gu@@ in R@@ and@@ om House to its partner company Ber@@ tel@@ s@@ mann , said that their expectation for a year has not changed since the sales income increase was announced to GBP 2.@@ 05 billion in the first half of the year .

attack in K@@ abu@@ l : NATO soldi@@ er killed in suicide attacks
the suicide bom@@ ber , according to officials , attacked military con@@ vo@@ ys in the capital of Afghanistan , K@@ abu@@ l , killing one NATO soldi@@ er and inju@@ ring several others .
in NATO &apos;s statement , five soldiers and interpreters were injured .
there were also three civilians who died in an incident in the city of Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ hi , according to local reports .
this bom@@ bing is the last of the acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in the Her@@ ati mos@@ que attack on Tuesday .
on Monday two people were killed by suicide bom@@ b@@ ers near the Iraqi E@@ mb@@ assy in K@@ abu@@ l .
NATO &apos;s statement said that there was an explosion on Thursday evening , when the Afghan army of collective pat@@ ro@@ ls was attacked with &apos; man @-@ made explosives &apos; .
according to the statement , everything has been injured in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital in Bag@@ ra@@ m airport .
according to Cor@@ respondents , the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic state , in Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ h , are a serious source of concern for the forces in Bag@@ h@@ dad , NATO .
according to the UN , at least 16@@ 62 civilians have died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital city .
at the end of July , the car bomb in K@@ abu@@ l killed at least 30 people , mainly in the S@@ hi &apos;@@ ite line .
according to the Taliban , they were behind the attack .
on 31 May , more than 150 people were killed by a major bomb attack in the central city , which has led most to death by military attacks in the country since US @-@ led forces were reluctant by the Taliban in 2001 .
this violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , while the President of the United States , Donald T@@ ru@@ mp , is considering whether to increase the number of US troops assisting the country &apos;s military forces and the police .
according to respondents , the suicide attacks in K@@ abu@@ l in recent weeks have also led to a public confidence crisis against the government , its policies and , in particular , President Ashraf G@@ h@@ an .
EPA annul@@ led the decision to postpone the regulation following shar@@ ks
the United States Environment Protection Agency ( United Nations Environmental Protection Agency ) annul@@ led the decision to delay the adoption by Obama of a regulation obli@@ ging states to limit su@@ rous emissions , one day after 15 states referred the Agency to the courts on account of its conduct .
the EPA announced a decision to proceed late on Wednesday 2015 , saying that it demonstrates the Agency &apos;s commitment to cooperation with states .
&quot; we believe that we need to engage in dialogue with our national partners and listen to them , &quot; said Scot@@ t P@@ ru@@ it@@ t , head of the EPA .
the P@@ ru@@ it@@ t had announced in June the intention of the EPA to postpone the rates of os@@ tility content in Peru , which measure pollution in the various parts of the country , in order to determine where this level should be reduced by one year in order to meet the highest air quality standard by one year by 2018 .
the 15 main democratic states , together with the Colom@@ bian community , submitted an action on Tuesday , saying that this decision is illegal .
President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s government has attempted to draw back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama .
however , these efforts have led to reactions among the groups of democrats and nature conservation who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on people &apos;s health .
it says on the EPA website that the brea@@ thing of ozone @-@ containing air &apos; could lead to a reduction in the employability of Cop@@ ts and an increase in the risk of suffering from res@@ pira@@ tory diseases , such as as@@ th@@ ma .

M@@ ür@@ y Gar@@ cia and V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss possible confrontation .
Mr V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko and Mr Gar@@ cia , who are supposed to be on a col@@ lisi@@ on course to face up to 6@@ 6.@@ 7 kg in the bo@@ xing category for the near future , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in the office of ES@@ P@@ N in L@@ OS An@@ ge@@ le@@ res , up to Gar@@ cia , the un@@ winning World Bo@@ avian Coun@@ c@@ il ligh@@ t@@ weight champion , wal@@ ked out the other side of the corridor to welcome L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t , World Bo@@ е@@ z@@ ation@@ i sul@@ g@@ weight che@@ que .
following a unanimous decision by Gar@@ cia , both comb@@ at@@ ants belong to the top of the weight table on Saturday in S@@ ho@@ w@@ Time , the former four @-@ time world champion , Adri@@ en B@@ ron@@ er .
Gar@@ cia extended its hand better and said , &apos; Ho@@ w does the summer go , the champion ?
I wish you every success . &quot;
Mr L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko is defending his bel@@ ts against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ ga on Saturday evening at 19 ES@@ P@@ N .
when a couple of pho@@ tos appeared , L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko &apos;s mä@@ ne@@ j@@ er , E@@ g Kli@@ mas , stated that there would be a &apos; perfect y@@ ard@@ stick &apos; against comb@@ at@@ ants .
&quot; I am a former consul@@ tant , &quot; said Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I called for B@@ ron@@ ger &#91; 6@@ 3.5 kg &#93; , but I am not so big .
I am small for 6@@ 3.5 kg .
I want to move down@@ wards .
and he has to move up to half the ligh@@ t@@ weight &#91; 6@@ 1.2 kg &#93; , and then we can fight .
games have called for this .
let us then help them to do so . &quot;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko agreed .
&quot; the world needs this fight . &quot;
in the climate , the question raised was whether it should be worthwhile looking at it , which is part of his strategy to allow L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ l to debate at the end of this year at 6@@ 1.2 kg of class in order to make it possible next summer to meet with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 no@@ vans ) , which also has an interest in combating Jor@@ ge L@@ in@@ are@@ se L@@ in@@ are@@ se and Lu@@ ke Cam@@ p@@ bel@@ li &apos;s match winners following their ligh@@ t@@ weight at For@@ ra@@ ut on 23 September .
&quot; looking at this fight could be worthwhile , as f@@ ans have called for this confrontation , &quot; said Gar@@ cia later , saying that he was open to fighting any channel offering the best financial packages .
&quot; we are key players .
no other name can attract so much attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Mrs Gar@@ cia said that she considers L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t a &apos; armed figh@@ ter &apos; , and that she could look to his Saturday &apos;s match .
however , L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko was ti@@ mid in pra@@ ising Gar@@ cia by saying that , in his view , the three di@@ vis@@ j@@ on champi@@ ons from Ri@@ ver@@ ge saw &apos; very slow ; apolo@@ gies , M@@ sele@@ y ... you wanted this no@@ distant &apos; .
according to Mrs Gar@@ cia , the aim was to show the strength of the blow@@ s and then bo@@ y .
both have confirmed that they feel that the tension is increasing in order to reach the challenge between them .
&quot; this is a fight that looks forward to realisation .
no other confrontation aro@@ uses so much attention and noise .
I am more than willing to work on this , &quot; said Gar@@ cia .
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko said : &apos; I have been waiting for the best fighters , and M@@ ae@@ y is exactly that .
this will be a good fight . &quot;
what world pressures are being moved to Estonia ?
soil was extended and issued quar@@ terly more than 13 000 residence permits by the police and border control authority ( PP@@ A ) for third @-@ country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia to work , study or family .
when , for example , soil was decided to issue a fixed @-@ term residence permit of 6@@ 7@@ 02 foreigners , Madagascar &apos;s number was 4@@ 9@@ 28 .
the services cannot tell us how many migrants will end up permanently staying in Estonia , but such an analysis will be drawn up by the Ministry of the Interior .
ten years ago , nearly 500 Ukrainians sat in Estonia a year ago , this figure will be close to 2 000 in recent years .
during the crisis in Ukraine , the number of applications for renewal increased dramatically , with 10@@ 87 people receiving fixed @-@ term residence permits in 2014 , up from 6@@ 75 in the previous year .
in Estonia , the highest number of Ukrainian citizens comes from the statistical authority , with 850 Ukrainian citizens arriving in Estonia in excess of their generosity .
&quot; the Ukrainian community has always been big in Estonia and , due to difficult circumstances in the country , it is natural that employment and learning opportunities should be sought from a country where the community and many families are already in front of the family . &quot; said Kris@@ tin Ram@@ alla@@ h , spokes@@ woman at the Ministry of the Interior .
the number of Ukrainian citizens who had fixed @-@ term residence permits was even higher than that of Russian citizens , even though in 10 years the lon@@ gest @-@ term residence permits have been issued .
when Ukrainians come to work mostly here , Russian citizens for family migration .
&quot; given the historic Russian community here , they are also more likely to have the greatest family ties with people living in Russia , &quot; said Hel@@ ina Me@@ dal , an internal protection agency .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen you look at where the citizens of Russia who have been licen@@ sed by Estonia live , Har@@ ju@@ maa is immediately Eastern Vir@@ g@@ land &apos; , he added and pointed out that about 40 % of them have been mar@@ ried with the citizens of the European Union .
soil was granted a fixed @-@ term residence permit of 16@@ 96 Russian citizens , which is also a record number .
at the same time , the number of Russians who wanted to extend their residence permits decreased .
&quot; compensation is the result that , instead of extending the residence permit , a new residence permit has been requested to settle permanently in Estonia , &quot; was explained by the press spokes@@ person at the Ministry of the Interior , Mr Ram@@ alla@@ h , who said that the interest of Russian citizens in Estonian residence permits has remained rather stable for years .
a new residence permit for Estonia to reside permanently can apply to foreigners who have lived here for at least three years from the previous year .
its aim is to encourage the Sil@@ k @-@ up of people who have been adapted .
however , long @-@ term resident residence permits require five years , for example .
the extension of the old residence permit has obviously also decreased as a result of the new residence permit .
for example , soil was granted such a residence permit to 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years .
the Ukrainians will now be able to exchange their jobs , and the Estonian state will no longer stop pointing the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met .
this residence permit has become popular - applications are still made by holders of a grey passport ( 10@@ 29 ) , Russians ( 4@@ 87 ) , Indi@@ ans ( 54 ) and n@@ ig@@ er@@ ans ( 36 ) .
a total of 19@@ 68 people , including 23 Americans , 12 Egypti@@ ans , 18 Georgi@@ ans and just as many Chinese , were able to live in Estonia for entry .
with the first half of this year , the total number of such applications is already 12@@ 69 .
in 10 years , surpris@@ ingly , Nigeria has become one of the most active applicants for Estonian residency .
when , in 2007 , three residence permits were issued to Fin@@ ns , soil was 200 .
Nigeria comes to learn from this university .
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular , for example , among Georgi@@ ans , the Chinese and the Tur@@ ks .
the number of citizens of India , Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen mostly thanks to learning games .
for them , too , there is the rule that , where a community has been set up , there will be others more easily , &quot; added Ram@@ alla@@ h . &quot;
over ten years , two people in Estonia have also moved , for example , from North Korea , just as much from La@@ os and Madagascar .
ten people have come here from Cuba , 2@@ 31 South Korea , 40 Indonesia and four U@@ ru@@ guay .
if around 6 000 third @-@ country nationals receive a residence permit a year , this is about 0.@@ 46 % of the total population .
even if you look at the citizens of the European Union , migration remains close to about a percentage , &quot; the mafia commented that the figures are actually small .
a total of 14 8@@ 22 people emig@@ rated to Estonia according to the statistics office , 13 7@@ 92 .
this means that immigration trans@@ cen@@ ds migration for a second year .
the majority of entrants and movements are Estonian citizens , but there are more of them among those who leave them .
that is why Estonian citizens &apos; migration my@@ ster@@ y with 2 000 people was in decline .
Est@@ oni@@ ans in particular mig@@ rate between Finland and Estonia .
M@@ ammu C@@ ou@@ ture Pr@@ inc@@ s@@ sim@@ de lu@@ res with sa@@ ts , chic@@ k@@ ens and t@@ arrogance .
there is , however , a history for Mrs Tam@@ me@@ or@@ u - old pain@@ ts and defen@@ dants : &apos; I can dream for hours somewhere in the muse@@ um and ad@@ m@@ ire the thi@@ ev@@ es and cra@@ ts of the old era .
if you take something with stone , you will study and learn from it on a daily basis .
it is a pleasure to find out .
the Arctic world of M@@ M@@ ou@@ ture C@@ ou@@ ture has the potential to appear in some alien environments , but the de@@ sig@@ ner does not think so .
you yourselves decide how much s@@ oul your life !
as a friend , as a whole , I have a sa@@ il full of the w@@ ounds that I have created , cou@@ ture .
because nor is it his fault that he does not live in Hol@@ ly@@ w@@ oo@@ s and does not go on a red wh@@ im every day ; he also wants to wear the most beautiful bro@@ kers and is suffering !
you will be able to live your own special life !
an ar@@ tist does not recognise the gap between the brea@@ ka@@ way events and the grey day .
it was this reasoning that put forward a plan to transfer high gra@@ de in Estonia to rural areas , between forests and fields , to people who often do not reach them .
for example , a joint colle@@ gi@@ tation was presented a long time ago , in comparison , in J@@ evening and in Per@@ lo mo@@ e@@ alle@@ el , where 45 mos@@ ques were filled by the Qu@@ e@@ en &apos;s de@@ fi@@ le@@ e as a whole .
there is often a han@@ g in the city of Tallinn , with dignity , but there is more emo@@ tion elsewhere - s@@ log@@ ans , b@@ ba@@ vo , stand up , want to thank you .
a large proportion of the audience had just had to be news , but now they are the f@@ ans of M@@ ammu C@@ ou@@ ture .
if you over@@ shoo@@ t people &apos;s expectations , they are spiri@@ ted !
and I like the feeling that I am in my fashion like the summer .
incidentally , we had a 50 @-@ me@@ tre red red car@@ pet , a whole street full of stic@@ kers , it seemed that they would not come to an end .
Mrs Ashton also does not recognise the fashi@@ on@@ able practice that nature must be presented by a super@@ imperialist super@@ b , she will be happy to bring ordinary women .
I often call on my own customers - they have always been happy .
after all , it is so la@@ x the experience , you find a wonderful piece on the tem@@ ple stage !
I am so sorry that I have never seen that I have never seen my own play , I am always behind the ground in order to be able , as a hope@@ less Span@@ i@@ ard , to put a last piece of meat on things .
my ner@@ v@@ ous would not allow a calm sight of the Chamber .
it is this kind of motto , Mrs Maria Maria Maria who wants not only to play a representative role , but also to be involved in everything .
I have my sis@@ ter in the core , and most of the colle@@ ctions are carried out by myself .
I like the whole process , where you play with details , to discover .
I am never far removed from my nature and I am not afraid of work .
it is not limited , but it is also a matter of injec@@ tion , logistics , organisation , organisation - everything has to ju@@ mp off the days of a woman of one tem@@ per@@ ment .
for these hours of work , the fana@@ tics still have a huge amount of work .
I cannot say when my working day ends , for me it is just a happy day !
I am still very lu@@ cky - it is like un@@ stop@@ p@@ able happ@@ iness : I do something beautiful , man gets something beautiful and , in turn , compli@@ ments .
it has been said several times that my bro@@ kers have a land gra@@ ce - they make themselves feel printed .
the gu@@ er@@ ri@@ l@@ ous , ul@@ tr@@ ul@@ li@@ ber@@ y lines made by Mrs Eb@@ adi known overnight have long since remained a signal from the C@@ ou@@ ture until now .
Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ p U@@ 18 boys : weapons of Est@@ oni@@ ans were now turned against us .
the damage , the fa@@ iry tale , ran out .
the first thing came to an end was that we could not get round our tables .
and when so much difference comes in the table , there is nothing to do , &quot; said Estonia U@@ 18 cor@@ v@@ pal@@ li@@ po@@ s 61 : 75 drop @-@ out to Britain , our only bas@@ ket@@ ball , BC Kal@@ e@@ v / Cra@@ mo ab@@ it@@ re@@ en@@ er Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ p .
opponents took 28 requests from the south @-@ west , which led to so many more attacks .
we were also not prepared to protect them agg@@ ressi@@ vely and not to attack them , which created it .
many of the attacks by the English people ended in three to five seconds , we were unable to build protection .
in defence , however , they were able to hold their hands somewhere , and we could not combine them .
it brought the team down its feet .
the work of the opponents was better done .
according to M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ pa , Estonia would have had to make more tac@@ tical mistakes in order to wi@@ pe out the anti @-@ insur@@ gency .
in the last quarter , we had a zero error , but opponents have already received a number of quick records .
A@@ tle@@ ss@@ ness and den@@ sity , which were our weapon at the al@@ ag@@ ro@@ pi@@ tur@@ ni@@ r , all now turned against us .
today we did not have the power against their agg@@ ressi@@ veness .
the M@@ y@@ r@@ r@@ hen@@ p remained satisfied with his neg@@ ligence in Kal@@ ev@@ is , Mat@@ th@@ ias T@@ as@@ tery .
security in general can say good words about the whole team ; to date , there has been a united shock .
it is a pity that such an aggressive response had not already been met before .
T@@ as@@ s have always been self @-@ confident and played out today , but he seemed to have been ti@@ red - he has borne quite a heavy burden .
but he made some very nice ges@@ tures , which I have seen before in tr@@ end@@ ars , adding guidance .
hor@@ ren@@ d@@ ous figures : E@@ M @-@ tur@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine was nominated for three quarters less than 10 ( ... ) .
U@@ 18 age classes do not apply only to the young men em B @-@ di@@ vis@@ j@@ on cor@@ v@@ pal@@ li@@ sig@@ ni@@ ir in Tallinn , she started in Dublin the day after yesterday .
and , unfortunately , Estonia &apos;s play with Poland la@@ gged in the area of anti @-@ ref@@ ri@@ ger@@ ators .
Estonia lost 25 : 65 , but even after the third quarter , the situation was 9 : 49 , or only in the last 10 minutes , opponents took their feet from the gas beet and 16 were left : 16 .
in both the first and the second quarter , Estonia thre@@ w 4 , 3rd point ...
at the same time , in the first two minutes , the Est@@ oni@@ ans caught two pieces of the first few minutes , and then played by 25 pieces , then one y@@ el@@ low , and then another 21 ta@@ les .
perhaps in almost half an hour , one of the 47 fin@@ s was tab@@ oo .
in addition , 2 points came from the four loo@@ ses .
there was a reasonable number of losses in this period of time , 12 .
at the end of the game , Poland had 33 and Estonia had 13 % ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has started with two losses , with 83 in Portugal having to be admitted on the opening day : 56 on the right .
NATO vessels came to Tallinn to complement supplies
today , for a week in Tallinn , NATO arrived at a permanent mine attack group for an initial port visit in order to supplement vessels &apos; stocks and prepare for prospe@@ ctive practices .
in the course of a visit , ships are preparing for landing on the sea , thereby giving cre@@ ws the opportunity to holiday on a daily basis .
following the visit , NATO vessels will remain in the waters of Estonia in order to carry out a number of exercises and to be ready for future operations in search of historic explo@@ its .
&quot; the participation of indigenous people in the NATO unit and the combined activities they carry out in local waters is a good illustration of our integration with the alli@@ ances , &quot; said the chief cap@@ tain Ar@@ to Rein@@ land , the overseas fleet Com@@ man@@ der .
as of 29 June , NATO will chair the Latvian Na@@ vy cap@@ ter , G@@ vi@@ do Lau@@ du@@ ps , a permanent group of land@@ filling officers from Estonia , Joh@@ an @-@ E@@ li@@ as Sel@@ ja@@ b , at a ceremony in Riga .
L@@ V@@ N@@ S Vir@@ sa@@ itis , a Latvian naval force , has been designated as the group &apos;s flagship port .
during this semester , the Estonian na@@ vi@@ al mine hun@@ ters are also part of an international unit .
as one of the four groups of vessels subject to NATO naval boards , NATO is a permanent group of primary respon@@ si@@ veness units that the Alliance can send to different parts of the world within five days .
4 . - T@@ o 13 August , the P@@ iri@@ ta mon@@ as@@ tery will once again become a place in which Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val , launched 13 years ago by Ma@@ es@@ tro E@@ r K@@ ans , will be held down .
this year , Mrs F@@ esti@@ val , the capital city &apos;s artistic leader , Ly@@ to J@@ oo@@ sti ( 36 ) , will be beautiful , powerful and unprecedented .

Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val is much more than just concer@@ ts and theat@@ re replies .
it is higher than any music theat@@ re in its usual form .
it is a festi@@ val that takes power and never gets rid of .
it is because the experience with which a lis@@ ten@@ er receives in this sup@@ erior and sal@@ va@@ ble environment puts humanity in a b@@ righ@@ ter way and concerns human beings in a way that cannot be described .
to the risk , you are the first year leader of Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val art .
did the Ma@@ es@@ tro E@@ ri K@@ babies &apos; sho@@ es not feel a little big ?
of course , but since I had a very personal relationship with Mr Klaus , there has been a lot of help .
he went through me all my student career and also supported the restoration at the start of the di@@ ame@@ tri@@ c career .
perhaps it is thanks to this that it will be easier for me to continue his work .
there has been so much ch@@ arity in different K@@ las and , of course , all of this goes to me .
it was excellent to join a team who knows exactly how things are going on .
it was the great heart of E@@ ri K@@ ans , too , who gave me the power to make a good move forward with Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val in Tallinn .
and here I am , and I can do it .
what about the audience at today &apos;s F@@ esti@@ val , what are you offering in particular ?
we have artists from England , Latvia , Lithuania and surprise , among other things , the first bal@@ ler written on Mrs L@@ ind@@ g@@ ren@@ i .
this is &apos; Kar@@ l@@ sson l@@ b &apos; .
and there is a no@@ torious nu@@ ance in this regard that the author of this bal@@ le@@ l is the Latvian com@@ po@@ ser , J@@ ur@@ is Kar@@ l@@ inning , who himself expressed a wish to write it .
apparently , she has already had a car@@ a@@ ture of Kar@@ l@@ sson , who has already lived in the heart of the child .
at the risk , how are you all ti@@ red of all this ?
thank you very much to my life @-@ spon@@ sored colleague .
such work requires a system of support and a lot of love , and this is something that I am lu@@ cky to have .
and I have noticed that my personal emo@@ tion does not depend so much on other people as I do , that is , how do I oppose every new day ?
and such an awareness of maintaining the tone , maintaining the usefulness and , in fact , s@@ mil@@ ing ourselves into the mir@@ ror of the morning rose by a significant percentage of my happ@@ iness .
especially now this week , when there are the most important tests , I have been particularly keen on it and it is working .
to lau@@ gh one@@ self is hur@@ ting the brain and raising the tone .
that is simply not a word .
I think that people do not yet know half the things of their own body , which the univer@@ se offers them , but it is one of the things that everyone will discover slowly .
right now , this is an important moment .
is there also a hard@@ ship before the di@@ ri@@ gen@@ d was taken ?
there is still a need to replace clothing with more comfort .
this is a small moment for ourselves .
in general terms , however , I do not have the opportunity to pu@@ mp or make a little c@@ ool before the big event .
in fact , I even like to talk actively to people , even before they take di@@ ri@@ gen@@ di@@ um .
however , come all to Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val , what is also to be detected here , not least for a big manager and a bal@@ le@@ t friend .

new results of tests for assessing the age of Swedish asylum seekers were published
the latest results of the tests show that more than 80 % of the constitution was assessed as older than 18 , but not all of them believe in the accuracy of the results .
the Swedish National Institute for Legal medicine ( R@@ asy@@ ts@@ preferably in@@ al@@ ver@@ t ) started the tests earlier this year .
the tests were set up for a more accurate assessment of the age during the application of the as@@ th@@ ma , following criticism by the Swedish Office for Migration ( I@@ OM ) for failing to correctly determine the age of a number of allegedly juven@@ ile refugees .
from March 2017 until mid @-@ 31 July 2017 , Tunisia has sent 6@@ 80 cases of testing , and the Institute for medicine has issued a total of 24@@ 81 tests .
Eigh@@ ty per cent ( 2002 ) was assessed for 18 @-@ year @-@ old or older cases , and in another 25 cases , the Institute for Legal medicine estimated that the test &apos; may be 18 @-@ year @-@ old or older &apos; .
in 4@@ 32 cases , it came to the conclusion that the person is &apos; probably younger than 18 &apos; .
the tests will only be used if a person &apos;s age is questioned .
according to Joh@@ an Gö@@ rans@@ son , who works in the Institute of judicial medicine , the results are consistent compared with those of previous months .
&quot; we do not see a big difference compared to the statistics of the past months ; the figures are quite consistent , &quot; he said to the newspaper The Local .
the fact that a large proportion of cases were assessed on average than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have been elected for their age .
the EIT issued the results of the 581 test in May and said that , in 4@@ 42 cases , &apos; there are indications that the person examining is 18 years old or older &apos; .
however , when the newspaper Svensson ska Dag@@ bla@@ det investigated the results of their 581 tests , it became clear that , in 2@@ 43 cases , a person had stated directly that he would receive 18 this year .
this medical age assessment method , in which f@@ ab@@ ul@@ l @-@ teet@@ h r@@ ö@@ n@@ t@@ gen@@ i@@ id images and ex@@ otic MR@@ T are carried out , has been criticised by dental doctors and radi@@ olo@@ gis@@ ts in some circles .
one of the sceptics is Ar@@ k@@ rin@@ olo@@ gist Claude Mar@@ cus , the K@@ aro@@ lin@@ ska Institute , whose task is to assess people &apos;s biological maturity in order to find out whether they went through audi@@ ences sooner or later .
&quot; I have had reason to think about this and I do not think that the method of measu@@ re@@ ments currently being used should be used .
the designation of biological age in this way is very precarious .
if we cannot safely say , then we should not pretend that we get , &apos; he said forestry to the newspaper .
however , Joh@@ an Gö@@ rans@@ son of the Institute for medical medicine defended the accuracy of the tests : &apos; in general , it can be said that the risk of pu@@ mping the baby in@@ adequately into adul@@ th@@ ood is neg@@ ligible .
the biggest risk , perhaps at around 10 % , would be if the person is just under 18 . &quot;
9 sign that you could for@@ give you for more expensive .
you paid you and spent a night with someone else .
the summer is painful , because you have so many nice times and memor@@ ies together .
I would like to reassure him , but is it the right time ...
Y@@ our Tan@@ go lists nine signs , which show that the cost of your action is tw@@ o@@ fold and can be for@@ given .
it seems more expensive to understand the seriousness of the situation and hard to deal with it .
more expensive treatment will be given to the problem that led him to a bed with a different com@@ pass .
you are no longer in a defen@@ sive position .
it sincerely regrets and takes responsibility for its actions .
he is not trying to blame you for your behaviour .
it agrees that it has made a serious mistake and is sincerely trying to improve the situation .
he is attentive and he is trying to communicate with you in a pleasant way .
at the same time , he is forcing you to get to gri@@ ps .
they do not deny what has happened , nor are they trying to make it un@@ noticed .
it is all the more expensive for you to understand why there was a lack of loy@@ alty to you .
you talk about this , and also about how to avoid it in the future .
you need to communicate better and assess each other &apos;s needs .
your more expensive attitude and action have helped you to develop our condolences against his mistake .
a more costly commitment and behaviour has created the basis for your proximity to return .
as a couple , you have made progress to believe once again in your unity and relationship .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old new@@ er , Anna Maria O@@ rel , made a beautiful debate in London , receiving 6@@ 7.@@ 3@@ 7 places of good 18 seats .
after that , M@@ M no@@ ori@@ m was a female j@@ ung@@ le , and a happy woman confirmed that he hopes to fight for med@@ als in the future .
the contest went well and had a good experience .
with the first test ( 6@@ 4.@@ 80 ) , I immediately removed my average result , the second one ( 6@@ 2.@@ 80 ) risk too much and the third one ( 6@@ 7.@@ 37 ) I was able to keep it very clear . &quot;
I expected my emissions , and I am very pleased that I found it .
Anna Maria O@@ re@@ li M@@ M &apos;s debate ended in a good 18@@ th place .
Vi@@ h@@ mas@@ ad@@ u O@@ reli@@ t did not mix , as he is , after all , training the winter through the TEC stage .
&apos;@@ I am terri@@ fied &apos; , he said a little bit more .
the London Olympic Assembly had almost a full house of the people , did the people reconsider themselves , or were they able to turn off ?
Mr Tajani , but in a positive sense .
everyone says it will add - that is the case !
if you compete on your own , you can experience it .
he then confirmed that he will be satisfied with the M@@ M debate and that he is still waiting for a lot of good competition : &apos; I came here with the 3@@ 2nd outcome of this season , in other words the last one , ended in 18@@ th place .
this is a very good result .
I am 20 years old and M@@ ore - that is the only thing that counts .
I take good experience and , in some days , I want to compete on behalf of med@@ als .
Western Vir@@ g@@ ina ku@@ ber@@ ner announced party change
the Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a Democrat Governor , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening , together with President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ a , that he would change political parties .
&apos;@@ L@@ et it not , but the democrats wal@@ ked away from me , &apos; said Governor Justice .
&quot; today , I say to you , having pushed a lot and thought for it ... today , I say to you , the Western peac@@ hes , that I can no longer help you as a democratic Governor . &quot;
explanations of joy were shed at the sitting .
&quot; so I will become Re@@ publi@@ can tomorrow , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a engine@@ er , I would say to you that it is time to play another game . &quot;
the T@@ ru@@ mp had previously promised a major announcement at the gathering of Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
T@@ ru@@ cher won 42 points in Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and Justice did not support the candidate for democrats , H@@ ill@@ ary Clin@@ ton .
justice , which , according to For@@ tera@@ i , is the only billion sta@@ r of the state , proved to have been elected in 2016 .
Ford states that it has coal mines in five states , and the coal business quite from its own father .
its value is approximately USD 1.@@ 59 billion .
at the same time , the Re@@ publi@@ can National Committee ( R@@ N@@ C ) published an announcement on Thursday night that &apos; the party exchange of Governor Justice is yet another blow to the democratic party park , which would rather prevent the country from being improved again rather than working for it &apos; .
&apos;@@ O@@ ver 15 months and controls over the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice &apos;s announcement is simply the most recent wake @-@ up call for par@@ ks that are out of the beginning and cannot find a positive and united message , &apos; said R@@ N@@ C representation R@@ on@@ na Mc@@ Daniel C@@ S New@@ si in his statement .
it is hardly surprising that , where there are many people , there are also many injured .
Ms Ur@@ met , who is in office at the We@@ ek@@ ise medical axis , told the girl yesterday that pos@@ ters had had to be distributed quite a lot .
Gran@@ des and br@@ ands are fundamental , ex@@ cus@@ es and easy failures .
of course , stal@@ ls , ru@@ ins and sho@@ es .
according to Ur@@ me@@ ti , visitors come to the festi@@ val with false foot@@ wear , and so there will be problems .
the media have also had to provide assistance to a couple of visitors with major injuries - there have been some s@@ care@@ mon@@ gering practices , and there have also been one foot@@ bal@@ ls .
we have also made bro@@ thers when a person has pul@@ led the hand or the finger .
let us do less nur@@ ses here ; let us send more to hospital .
look at the vide@@ os as to whether the brak@@ es on the media for the treatment of po@@ ta@@ ble@@ t would also ask a pain@@ kil@@ ler .
Co@@ e praised the Russians &apos; honest apolo@@ gies for the D@@ ing@@ us@@ h@@ all .
according to his words , &apos; Russia &apos;s honest apolo@@ gy from Thursday &apos; , the international r@@ alli@@ ed S@@ ebas@@ tian Co@@ e was praised , but repeated that now is not the time to allow the country to return to sport .
D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ ce@@ h@@ tin , who entered into force at the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World C@@ up , said that the competition ban imposed on his country is the right one and has a firm aim to combat doping .
he apolog@@ ised for &apos; all kinds of ligh@@ ters who have been bur@@ nt out in competitions by gol@@ den and sil@@ ver med@@ als &apos; .
in spite of his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted in favour of keeping the ban on competition in force , which was introduced in November 2015 , after the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ AD@@ A ) report found evidence of state @-@ spon@@ sored doping in Russia .
&quot; in my opinion , today it was a very honest presentation , a very honest presentation , saying to the press the President of IA@@ AF , Mr Costa .
&quot; the entire Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation itself recognised that they had had had rather difficult times and that they would do their utmost to reform the al@@ union . &quot;
according to Co@@ e , he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for self @-@ anticip@@ ation .
&quot; I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is being made , but the Congress supports the proposal of the working group that now is not the right time to withdraw Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we must do everything possible over the next few months to norm@@ alise the situation .
we are always guided by the principle that we want to iso@@ late clean spor@@ ts@@ men and spor@@ ts@@ people from the broken system , &quot; he added .
one of the hundreds of Russian fri@@ vol@@ ers who meet the strict criteria of IA@@ AF are competing with the ligh@@ ter entry into force in London on Friday as neutral ath@@ le@@ tes in the World C@@ up .
the head of the IA@@ AF working group , R@@ une Andersson , said on Monday that Russia does not yet meet a number of rehabilitation criteria .
following a presentation to the IA@@ AF Council , he told journalists in London that doping control is still insufficient and that le@@ c@@ ture@@ rs banned are still operating freely .
the electric car revolution substantially changes the demand for metals .
who are the winners and losers ?
not only does the electric car revolution fundamentally change everything from the fuel market to infrastructure , but it also creates new winners and losers in the me@@ tal market .
although extra@@ gi@@ ants such as G@@ len@@ core can say that they will win from one place to another , smaller mining firms will not help .
G@@ len@@ core coal and oil currently serve , but , in the era of electric cars , co@@ balt , li@@ thi@@ um , cop@@ per , alu@@ mini@@ um and nic@@ ot@@ ine demand will continue to grow .
this year , governments in the United Kingdom , France and Norway have stepped up their contributions on the spread of electric cars to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades .
that is why Mr Vol@@ vo has already announced that he is planning to give up an internal combustion engine , and T@@ es@@ la will bring to the market a cheaper Blue 3 electric car .
B@@ animal berg &apos;s New Energy Finance Facility estimates that over two decades electric cars will be sold more than those using oil @-@ fired fuels .
&quot; with regard to some metals , this will change everything , &quot; said Sim@@ ona G@@ amb@@ ran@@ in B@@ animal .
we have already seen a huge impact on metals such as co@@ balt and li@@ thi@@ um , which have been growing demand for years .
in electric cars there are approximately three times more cop@@ ies than in conventional cars , G@@ len@@ core declared .
even more answers are needed at charging stations , so Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris estimates that this will increase demand by around 5 % by 2025 .
the increase in demand for electric cars means additional demand for li@@ thi@@ um , co@@ balt , gra@@ p@@ hite and man@@ gan@@ ans .
G@@ len@@ core deri@@ ves profits from cop@@ per price increases for electric cars and the fact that there is the world &apos;s largest co@@ bal@@ ti@@ er producer , predicted by the J@@ eff@@ ila Group .
according to this bro@@ ker company , the winners of the winners of the F@@ bet@@ report @-@ Mc@@ Mo@@ R@@ an and first Qu@@ an@@ ma Min@@ er@@ conventions are the winners .
the market is reacting to a changing trend .
this year there has been a 70 % drop in the London me@@ tal exchange rate .
there was a 37 % increase in soil prices .
finally , 14 % this year , mainly as a result of economic growth .
G@@ len@@ core shares rose by 20 % in London , having exceeded the price rise to the ri@@ val Rio T@@ lide Group , B@@ H@@ P Bil@@ lit@@ oni and Ang@@ lo Stream .
on the manufacturers &apos; side there are lead companies such as Rec@@ y@@ ht@@ x and Cam@@ p@@ ine , who have to adapt to a new era .
the main end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ hand use of the P@@ rin@@ ce is the bat@@ teries supplying the start @-@ ups of cars with a diesel engine .
electric cars are used by li@@ iti@@ u@@ mines .
&quot; this is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found for other purposes that could overcome the fall in demand , &quot; said Michael W@@ id@@ mer , Governor of the Bank of America Mer@@ ri@@ ll Lyn@@ ch me@@ tal Market analysis .
there is still a lack of insight into the impact of the generous trend .
P@@ li@@ c is 17 % this year , which is the best me@@ tal in London among the main industrial metals .
investors will see problems for me@@ tal in the long term .
&quot; I am not sure it is so bad for lead , because cheap oil is keeping ordinary cars competitive , &quot; said Her@@ wi@@ g Schmidt , a me@@ tal company Tri@@ land Me@@ talia .
if lead demand falls , it will take place slowly .
that may be the case in about 10 years &apos; time .
up to now , however , stricter emission standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars , which are more frequent dependent on advanced lead @-@ based bat@@ teries , will be assessed by the international lead and by the investigative body .
heavy metals such as alu@@ mini@@ um will be replaced by steel , as a ligh@@ ter car will be able to drive less electricity .
this explains an additional 1.6 million tonnes of closed minimum demand between 2013 and 2016 .
it accounts for 2.7 % of the world &apos;s output of alu@@ mini@@ um .
this trend is likely to grow , says W@@ id@@ mer .
A@@ lu@@ mini@@ um catches 13 % this year because the growing demand by car manufacturers has led to market shortages .
steel producers do not .
he is working with General Motors to use nanotechnology for the production of wonderful cars .
Ar@@ cel@@ or@@ Mit@@ tal is also trying to develop a ligh@@ ter mel@@ t@@ down from steel in order to oppose a minimum .
&apos;@@ A strong steel should be the answer to this development &apos; said Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris &apos;s analysis , Syl@@ vain Br@@ un@@ et .
we see some progress in Europe .
the end of the oil era can also result in suffering for pla@@ ice .
soil took about half of this precious me@@ tal diesel engine as a catalyst for cars , and was announced by the me@@ tal fin@@ er Joh@@ n@@ son Mat@@ teries .
&quot; many of the raw materials , such as oil and pla@@ te , may not have high demand in the future , &quot; said Bernard D@@ ah@@ da@@ h , Na@@ ti@@ x &apos;s raw materials analysis .
this does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important , but their importance will change within 15 years .
Pla@@ at@@ ine manufacturers believe in the continued demand for diesel hybrid cars .
Marc G@@ ry@@ n@@ berg , leader of Un@@ core power , said that more hybrid cars will continue to be sold in 2025 .
in the 10 @-@ year perspective , To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Motors and Hy@@ mun@@ i Mo@@ tos have been developed on hydrogen @-@ based cars that depend on a pos@@ ter in order to generate electricity from hydrogen .
until now , however , this technology has not yet legisla@@ ted commercially .
&quot; the Di@@ et appears to be a clear losers along the road to electric cars , &quot; said Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris from Brussels .
German car manufacturers received a major set@@ back in July because the S@@ tut@@ t@@ g@@ art court banned the use of diesel in Mercedes @-@ Ben@@ z and Por@@ sch@@ e &apos;s home city .
how the monetary rules for football affect Ney@@ ra &apos;s transition to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing ram@@ pan@@ t spending of football clubs in Europe do not prevent Ney@@ ra &apos;s world record transfer from the Spanish football club to the French club Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequence from UEFA , the governing body , which domin@@ ates the European game and which has the power to ban teams from taking part in the security of the pres@@ ti@@ gious League of Ministers , will wait until Saint @-@ Ger@@ May for Paris .
the financial rules on fair play ( F@@ F@@ P ) , introduced by UEFA in 2011 , mean that the PS@@ G will have to prove at some point that Ney@@ ra &apos;s swit@@ ch@@ over was financed without huge losses .
EUR 2@@ 22 million were paid to Barcelona ( USD 2@@ 62 million ) just because the Brazili@@ ans bought out of its contract , and Ney@@ ra &apos;s salary will reach tens of millions of dollars a year .
here there are some aspects of Ney@@ ra &apos;s transfer to the French club .
the PS@@ G will undoubtedly be able to extra@@ ct such money for the recruitment of Ney@@ ra and for inclusion of its sta@@ rs in a clo@@ ak , given that the team is funded by a family governed by the Ka@@ tar energy pipeline .
clubs have been allowed to spend a great deal on recru@@ iting players , but they have to balance it with legal sources of income that enable them to come up with them in football .
F@@ F@@ F@@ P formed the basis for Michel Pla@@ tini following his election as UEFA in 2007 .
this former French player believed that clubs who are falling into debt in search of success are actually engaged in fraud and risk sw@@ am@@ ping if the banks or owners were to give up subsidies .
as of 2011 , F@@ F@@ P will focus on monitoring their losses instead of the debts of clubs .
this change means that the business model used by Ro@@ man Ab@@ ra@@ mo@@ vi@@ ch first used in 2003 in C@@ hel@@ sea - to buy a club with potential and then spend heavily to improve the team and create a global brand - is more difficult to implement .
during the current three @-@ year evaluation period of F@@ F@@ F@@ P , which runs until 2018 , the clubs may bear up to EUR 30 million in losses .
and despite the fact that Mr Pla@@ tini &apos;s successor , Alexander C@@ ef@@ er@@ in , is still committed to blocking excessive spending in 2015 .
&quot; F@@ F@@ F@@ P is certainly not dead and we will no doubt continue to strengthen these rules in the future , &quot; &quot; said last week The negotiator , Andre@@ a Tra@@ ver@@ so , the UEFA @-@ s F@@ F@@ P Supervisor .
even though the PS@@ G ta@@ dus Ney@@ ra for the over@@ purchase clause as one full payment , they will be able to allocate this amount for the purposes of accounting for the entire duration of the agreement .
Mrs Ney@@ mar concluded a five @-@ year agreement , so it will be possible to indicate a transitional fee of EUR 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million over the next five years .
for the first wave of F@@ F@@ P sanctions in 2014 , the PS@@ G , together with Manch@@ ester C@@ it@@ y@@ ga belonging to Abu D@@ ha@@ bi , received the most severe penalties .
PS@@ G was fined EUR 60 million ( USD 82 million at this point ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million , and the club called for the crew of the League of Me@@ is@@ ts to be limited to 21 players during the 2014 @-@ 2015 season instead of the usual 25 .
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to over@@ ride the regulatory authorities by ex@@ tor@@ ting their revenues through companies linked to owners of the club .
the Ca@@ tar company may spon@@ sor the PS@@ G , but if the value of spon@@ sorship is recognised as standard market rates , UEFA would not allow it to be counted as official income .
this was the case in 2014 , when UEFA decided that Q@@ a@@ tar tourist Authority PS@@ G &apos;s value had been ex@@ cited .
it has been said that a certain part of Mrs Ney@@ ra &apos;s PS@@ G service could come to Ka@@ Infrastructure through contributions from the Management Committee of the World C@@ up in 20@@ 22 .
however , the PS@@ G and Q@@ a@@ tar 20@@ 22 deny that Ney@@ ra could become a world champi@@ on@@ ship and say that UEFA &apos;s regulatory authorities would be easily able to expose such a manoeuvre .
the penalties previously imposed on PS@@ G mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant with regard to any attempt to ignore the rules .
people familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed the transition pro @-@ actively with PS@@ G @-@ Ney@@ ra .
they were talking to ETA on condition that their anon@@ y@@ mity is guaranteed , as they are not allowed to discuss the situation of the PS@@ G .
the latest reports show that over € 10 million worth of revenue during the 2015 @-@ 2016 season at around € 54@@ 2.4 million .
data from the last financial year have not yet been published .
PS@@ G hopes that the arrival of Ney@@ ra will have a positive impact on spon@@ sorship transactions , trade and s@@ nus .
the club looks forward to an increase of at least 30 % in turnover in relation to the conclusion of the contract .
Spain too , having clearly upset the departure of one of the biggest football sta@@ rs , sought to block Ney@@ ra &apos;s transition by saying that the PS@@ G is in breach of the F@@ P .
&quot; this is a clear case of &apos; financial doping &apos; with the club and with the state , &quot; said President Javier T@@ eb@@ as to the Spanish newspaper AS , referring to the fact that the PS@@ G belongs mainly to Ka@@ tari@@ as .
Ar@@ sen@@ al mä@@ ne@@ j@@ er Ar@@ ţ@@ W@@ en@@ ger , whose club belongs to the American sports mag@@ na@@ ge , shares the view that the state finances the club .
&quot; this is the result of property rights , and it has completely changed the entire football landscape over the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ en@@ ger on Thursday .
&quot; if the club belongs to the state , everything is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play , as the state may have other ways or other interests to represent such a major player . &quot;

fif@@ ty years ago today : the Or@@ ch@@ op@@ ian storm in Estonia , which was kno@@ cking on houses and win@@ dows .
the H@@ ur@@ ric@@ ane described as a century storm , which , on 6 and 7 August , caused serious damage , particularly to the West , Har@@ ju@@ ria and the Black Sea .
during these days in the north @-@ west of Estonia , the wind was more than 30 m@@ m / s .
in my old factory in Ba@@ vari@@ a , I went from one map pu@@ b to the other to the other and had a hand in supporting them .
everything was blind and mar@@ vel@@ l@@ ous , just like the world stage .

L@@ inda &apos;s hus@@ band saw his bel@@ ong@@ ings collapsed .
however , what sort of support were you going to give in to your hands , where are you coming up against such a storm ?
Ha@@ ap@@ sal@@ us Kal@@ da , who lived on the streets , came down as a window , when the win@@ dows fle@@ shed water . &quot;
the fact that the roads were full , and the cab@@ in coverage of the railway station had been flying 20 to 30 metres , has seen L@@ inda the majority of shar@@ ks just like next morning .
according to the local authorities , the ca@@ ts behind the Par@@ ale@@ pa were behind hope , some were completely leng@@ ths , some boys .
everyone saw it very frustra@@ ting , the storm went out of hundreds of old trees as ra@@ da@@ r and pragmatism like a war .

in Tallinn , the wind was measured by up to 35 metres per second , or approximately 130 kilometres a hour .

they are in the air and will no longer be signed ! &apos; , wrote Vir@@ u@@ maa theat@@ re .
in Vil@@ j@@ an@@ di@@ land , the generation &apos;s natural building was destroyed so much during the stor@@ ms that it was decided afterwards to dismantle it .
it was not opposed to the design of the T@@ ü@@ r E@@ mp@@ ire , which was later not restored .
on 12 August 19@@ 57 , the newspaper Red Cross wrote that ref@@ urb@@ ishment of towns and cities and settlements is progressing slowly and that their vehicles are progressing slowly , and the population could be involved in cleaning work .
Gra@@ ins were also severely affected in Tu@@ rin , and the newspaper stated that &apos; party organisations must be an incentive and guidance both for cor@@ ps and fer@@ tility cor@@ ps &apos; .

in addition to S@@ tro@@ om , he is still keeping an eye on the coast of P@@ iri@@ ta , Har@@ ta La@@ ke , Ka@@ ku@@ mä@@ e and Pal@@ ar@@ a@@ are P@@ ik@@ ak@@ ari .
landfill amounts have fallen .
years ago , there was much more .
people can now already assess what is being done for them , &apos; U@@ so@@ v is talking about who has cor@@ rup@@ ted migrants for 15 years .
it was the case that , when something new had been stood up , it was already over the next day .
now , what is on the coast is already being held .
clean coast price
one of the biggest jobs on Estonia &apos;s be@@ aches is the repetition of the rub@@ b@@ ish , the ad@@ ru .
for example , it has to be transported 400 000 tonnes on the coast of P@@ iri@@ ta .
&apos;@@ This is an incredible amount &apos; , marks U@@ so@@ v .
the second major category is municipal rub@@ b@@ ish , that is to say , all that people are leaving behind .
one and a half kilometres offshore in S@@ tro@@ om have eight large rub@@ b@@ ish lines that need to be scra@@ pped three times a week .
so much will come from rub@@ b@@ ish .
however , cold summer tables have meant that rub@@ b@@ ish is one fifth less than otherwise .
the third species comprise abandoned things .
in most cases , they are children &apos;s tele@@ visions .
this time , the U@@ so@@ v E@@ mp@@ ire has pul@@ led out of the sand ten metres of slu@@ dge .
they leave owners waiting for a flo@@ ating wood route .
&quot; they usually come out more , but it is a normal harvest . &quot;
children come to ran@@ k and take toys in order to bur@@ y them back into the sand .
landfill is broken down .
Erika Sch@@ ol@@ ler , a representative of administrative services , has admitted that a tra@@ ctor &apos;s screening work is disrup@@ ted by local authorities .
noise , which las@@ ts from night to hour , is mixed up by people living in the neighbourhood .
on the day , however , this work is impossible .
in one month , rand will have to travel twice .
&quot; if we do not do so , we will be fined by the city , &quot; Sch@@ ol@@ ler will mark .
however , like P@@ iri@@ ta , P@@ ik@@ ka@@ r and Savary , the aim is also to get S@@ tro@@ om rand below the quality of the international flag .
&quot; compared to Europe , there is much more work in Estonia to care for be@@ aches , &quot; says Sch@@ ol@@ ler .
we have more ad@@ ples and more ki@@ ds and it is more difficult for a friend to join .
however , there is less rub@@ b@@ ish in our be@@ aches than elsewhere in Europe .
when I hear that there is talk of rub@@ b@@ ish , the conver@@ sa@@ tions between Mr Martin , who is living near S@@ tro@@ om &apos;s be@@ aches , are taken in@@ ex@@ or@@ ably by a journalist and cor@@ ro@@ gation staff , pointing out the current bottlenecks .
there is a picture of the moon everywhere in the gallery .
there is a problem with birds and bot@@ tom@@ less sla@@ ves who have hi@@ jac@@ ked rub@@ b@@ ish bags , &quot; said Martin .
although it is difficult to assume that people are able to change their behaviour so far , Martin hopes that the urban government will do something with rub@@ b@@ ish s@@ log@@ ans and , for example , put them on the ro@@ of@@ s , in order to prevent at least birds going on there .
in general , however , Martin S@@ tro@@ om is satisfied with developments .
we can see that the city takes care of this .
it has become more pleasant with baby wal@@ kers , enligh@@ tened and fresh as@@ ph@@ alt roads .
at one time it was the case that only one route could be taken in in@@ stant cases , &quot; says Martin .
findings of S@@ tro@@ om@@ is : coins , only coins
twenty @-@ seven @-@ year @-@ old Dimit@@ ri , who , as a ar@@ mi@@ er heating , is sa@@ iling along the coast@@ line with metal@@ lic de@@ pression , has had to be exploited as a measure of tomorrow &apos;s size .
he does not believe that , today and in the future , he will find anything valuable .
sea ang@@ les are not generous enough to do so .
&quot; I have been dealing with this for one year , and so far nothing worthwhile , &quot; says D@@ mit@@ ry .
as a ref@@ rig@@ eration , in D@@ mit@@ ry , there are some euro coins , bot@@ tles and also dangerous p@@ ounds which later du@@ mped in the rub@@ b@@ ish .
normally , there are still coins .
&quot; culture , the finger and so on are usually not the case , &quot; they are owned by the ar@@ mi@@ es .
Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain on the previous level , as un@@ f@@ ette@@ red economic growth and the easing of inflation have cus@@ hi@@ oned speculation in relation to the increase .
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain a lo@@ opho@@ le , as household incomes have put interest rates on hold .
decision makers of the Bank &apos;s Financial Policy Committee ( MP@@ C ) have voted 6 : 2 in favour of 0.@@ 25 % retention and fewer members this month are calling for an increase , as slow growth has weakened support for growth .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast from 1.7 % in 2017 to 1.6 % in 2018 and warned that the pressure on household incomes would remain , as inflation is still expected close to 3 % in the autumn .
at the same time , however , the Bank also sign@@ alled that the increase in rates is necessary to contain inflation from Bre@@ x@@ on over the next few years , and the expected increase in lending costs on the financial markets may be necessary .
Members also voted in favour of the partial withdrawal of the ma@@ m@@ mot@@ h package , which was launched a year ago as a result of Bre@@ x@@ ti .
in February , the Bank will termin@@ ate its fixed @-@ term cash scheme , which provides banks with cheap funding , even though it said that it is now up to GBP 15 billion more to be offered under this scheme , which is GBP 115 billion .
in the minutes of the decision on the rate , the Bank says : &apos; in the central forecast of MP@@ C , gross domestic product ( GDP ) will remain power@@ less in the near future , since the difficult situation of real household incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption &apos; .
as regards the rates , it was reiterated that , in order to mitigate inflation , a &apos; fiscal effort &apos; was needed , to a somewhat greater extent than expected in the markets .
Eurosta@@ rs is currently predi@@ cting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020 .
however , the Bank stressed that any benefit is gradual and limited .
the Bank &apos;s reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the forecasts in May .
the forecast of 1.8 % growth in 2018 remained unchanged .
after this news , the p@@ ound went down against the dollar and the euro .
women fell by 0.5 % to USD 1.@@ 31 and 0.@@ 4 % to EUR 1.@@ 11 .
the decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointing growth figures , which have led to an increase in expectations concerning the increase in GDP in Cotonou , from 0.2 % to 0.@@ 3 % in the second quarter .
the Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.@@ 3 % in the third quarter , although at the end of the year it is starting to boost a little .
the Bank &apos;s latest inflation report gave little reason to re@@ jo@@ ice households with rising inflation and pi@@ tiful wage increases , saying that the situation would go a little worse before improvements were made .
it has been added that the monetary policy cannot prevent a fall in income in the next few years , but a significant recovery is expected towards the end of the three @-@ year forecast .
thanks to the noble p@@ ound , the growing demand for British produce is also an incentive for the economy , partly compensa@@ ting consumers for lower costs .
the decision will come one year after the 0.@@ 25 % in August last year , after the shocking EU referendum , which led to a sudden weakening of the p@@ ound .
according to the Bank , it is likely that it will take four years for prices and the economy to be completely revi@@ ved .
prior to the Bank &apos;s last decision , there was a feeling of increasing demand because inflation had increased pressure on households ; in July , three policy makers called for an increase of 0.5 % .
inflation fell by 2.6 % last month , compared to 2.9 % in June , even though the Bank &apos;s message was expected , and in the coming months there will be an increase again .
the Bank said that excessive growth compared to the 2 % target was caused by a completely weak p@@ ound .
Andrew Mon@@ t@@ la@@ ke , leader of Co@@ rec@@ o mort@@ ga@@ ges , said : &apos; in the light of the recent downturn in exchange rates , the mortgage market appears to be becoming increasingly competitive once again , as borro@@ w@@ ers want work and hope to finish the year in a positive way .
Eurosta@@ rs seems to be particularly favourable for those whose current transactions are coming to an end , as re@@ financing , often without service and low rates , has become increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS writing 10 000 people out of conflict with HIV medi@@ cation
patients will have access , from September onwards , to &apos; trans@@ forma@@ tive treatment &apos; for HIV prevention after the battle in the Supreme Court over whether or not the N@@ HS should finance the medicine .
N@@ HS England announced that public health is now expected to make it available to 10 000 people during an initial three @-@ year clinical attempt to contact pre @-@ emp@@ tively ( Pr@@ EP ) - a ta@@ ble@@ t that is man@@ ned prior to the interim procedure and has shown a approximately 86 % reduction in the risk of infection for high @-@ risk people .
the N@@ HS agreed to finance a clinical attempt after last year &apos;s ruling by the Court of appeal that the N@@ HS would be able to pay for Pr@@ EP , despite its own asser@@ tions that the drug should be financed by local authorities .
the Executive Director of N@@ HS Eng@@ land , Simon Ste@@ 186 , welcomed this on Thursday as a &apos; swee@@ ping intervention &apos; , while the National AIDS Fund ( NA@@ T ) described it as a &apos; momen@@ t@@ ous moment &apos; .
sex health clin@@ ics in London , B@@ right ton , Manch@@ ester , Li@@ ver@@ po@@ oli@@ s and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ s are among the first to register people , and further clin@@ ics will be added in October , before the programme is introduced anywhere in England by April 2018 .
&apos;@@ Pr@@ EP &apos; is a hot@@ line for HIV drugs that will be taken before the incident in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
clinical trials show that Pr@@ EP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV among people at risk of infection .
Pr@@ EP prior to taking action means that there are a sufficient number of certain medicines in the body that prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can take place on a daily basis or at the latest two hours prior to an interim procedure .
the right candidates include L@@ GB@@ T men , trans@@ gender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and do not receive treatment .
they identify suitable people who are willing to participate in clinical trials , including men , women , trans@@ gender people and those whose HIV @-@ related partner cannot receive anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment .
people who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will also be able to register their willingness to participate in the local sex health clin@@ ics which participate in the programme .
the programme costs GBP 10 million , and N@@ HS England signed the contract to get medicines this week after the international procurement procedure .
the clinical test aims to assess the true potential of Pr@@ EP by gathering clinical evidence of who is treated and how it is consumed and implemented in a large cloud .
Ste@@ 186 said : &apos; this new wide @-@ ranging intervention should complement and enhance a comprehensive and increasingly successful fight against HIV .
this is yet another milestone for more than three decades in the fight against one of mankind &apos;s biggest health problems . &quot;
D@@ eb@@ or@@ ah gold , Chief Executive of NA@@ T , said : &apos; this is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV .
the Pr@@ EP , if properly targeted at those who need it and are at risk level , offers an opportunity to change the British HIV epidemic .
since September , people with a high HIV risk in England have had access to a powerful new tool financed by the N@@ HS , which is individually managed and does not depend on the negotiations with the partner , thereby improving many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
ian Green , Executive Director of the Ter@@ rence Higgins Foundation , said : &apos; it is now essential to ensure that a clinical trial is launched quickly on the part of the country and that none of the members of the HIV risk group are excluded .
now that the Pr@@ EP clinical trial has been received , we are on the way to protect more than 10 000 people who are at risk of being infected with HIV .
Minister for Public Health , Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , said : &apos; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP clinical trial is a very welcome and long overdue one , after months of delay and the cen@@ sus of government sho@@ es .
evidence shows how much change this drug can bring to HIV prevention and end the spread of this life @-@ changing infection .
this clinical attempt will lead us a step closer to a complete understanding of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
it is now important that a clinical trial is carried out as soon as possible in order to protect people who have contact with HIV and bring us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
electricity prices rose by 12 % in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
the difference between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania in electricity prices for the next day decreased to EUR 1.@@ 94 compared with EUR 7.@@ 71 in June this year , Ele@@ ring .
the main cause of the price gap is the wealth of the Lithuanian @-@ Swedish Community .
in Estonia last month , the average electricity exchange rate amounted to EUR 3@@ 4.@@ 33 per me@@ ga@@ va@@ ge hour and the price rose by 12 % compared to June .
in Latvia and Lithuania the price fell by five per cent to EUR 3@@ 6.@@ 27 per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t hour .
in Finland , the price was EUR 3@@ 4.@@ 17 , while the electricity exchange rate was EUR 2@@ 6.@@ 37 per me@@ ga@@ va@@ ge hour .
prices rose by 12 and 7 % respectively .
between Estonia and Finland , electricity moved from 75 % last month to Estonia and 16 % from Estonia to Finland .
the other nine per cent of transactions between the two countries did not take place for the next day .
between Estonia and Latvia , electricity moved from Estonia to Latvia at 99 % , and 73 % of hours had full transmission capacity .
according to transactions in the Nas@@ da@@ q OM@@ X market on July &apos;s latest trading day , in August the electricity exchange price could reach approximately EUR 34 and EUR 37 per me@@ ga@@ va@@ ge hour .
the carbon price affecting the price of electricity production came up last month and transactions took place between EUR 5.@@ 04 and EUR 5.@@ 47 per tonne .
living in higher life - In a qu@@ asi and smart de@@ sig@@ ners , it has become home to the small Ear@@ ls Court of Justice .
Jo@@ anne Le@@ igh , a former ban@@ ker who is a passion@@ ate property innova@@ tor , changed his home of K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in 2014 against the Ear@@ ls Court .
this is in the first order of Qu@@ e@@ en Anne Ter@@ ţ@@ i , and the fact that Jo@@ anne has not brought his bags together and sold the fla@@ ts is a tribute to the new design .
&quot; prior to that , together with a former com@@ pass in K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge , I lived on a much larger scale , &quot; said Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I chose something that would be tanta@@ mount to the price that I have offered .
I was shown by the Ear@@ ls Court of Justice , which had the same high waves .
I knew about it , and I made an offer on the same day . &quot;
since the first visit , the 93 @-@ me@@ tre cor@@ ps have gone through a complete wave of innovation .
at the beginning , it was a s@@ lee@@ ping cor@@ t and a difficult sticking plas@@ ter - it had to walk through kit@@ chen in order to arrive at a s@@ lee@@ ping pi@@ pe ; Jo@@ anne wanted to add savings and qu@@ asi @-@ regulation in order to take advantage of the high moun@@ tains .
&quot; I wanted high , big win@@ dows , a lot of light .
these were my demands , &apos; he said .
he ap@@ pealed to Er@@ fan Az@@ ad N@@ ot@@ ting , the archite@@ ctural and de@@ sig@@ ner session Du@@ ck &amp; Order , to take advantage of the 3.@@ 8 m de@@ ser@@ ts and create a home that is not just a development site , but a place where Jo@@ anne can live .
it was not high enough to add two spaces to each other , so the archite@@ ctural challenge was to create a qu@@ asi @-@ order in which to stand up .
the Er@@ fan had to take a creative approach .
&quot; aquaculture is rather complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to re@@ organise the premises so that they were located on one another , without having to bo@@ ast .
it was not just about building a platform , but using steel design so that it is right that both the upper and lower space . &quot;
this emphasis allowed Mr Er@@ fan@@ s to create , in the room , two fla@@ mb@@ les with complete arrogance with a lot of dramatic elements .
one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ one @-@ size @-@ fits @-@ all will be opened with lighting on the R@@ et@@ rou@@ vi@@ us window for gla@@ ci@@ ers under the sun .
the gol@@ den fur@@ ni@@ ture , sil@@ ver details and retro@@ pa@@ ci@@ lian Ser@@ ge M@@ ou@@ ille &apos;s light underline the style of space .
the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in the addition of communications , space and traffic lights .
in both the short corridors , mir@@ rors have been included so that it appears longer .
in K@@ night , the mir@@ ror is giving the impression of the second window , which opens up .
in the course of its activity , the cen@@ sus provides a reflection of the deposit for all the eating disorders and glass requirements of Jo@@ anne .
housing is accompanied by a false opportunity to close the vegetables if it is not used , creating an image of a smarter space .
cu@@ mu@@ lative kit@@ chen is nothing new .
however , with this kit@@ chen , what is unique is the fact that it is a plu@@ g of u@@ pris@@ ings of gar@@ age .
&quot; it did a little bit of design , &quot; explained by Er@@ fan ter@@ as@@ tron@@ om@@ y from M@@ D@@ F .
&quot; this has a counter@@ weight , which is why it is very easy to put up with it . &quot;
thanks to the smart use of space and reser@@ vo@@ irs , Jo@@ anne now has 16 additional square me@@ ters , additional s@@ lee@@ ping rooms and a better harves@@ ter plan .
after all , what you sell - or what adds value to property - is &apos; Er@@ fan .
&apos;@@ Kin@@ nis@@ mineral land k@@ ler takes an outdated form of tu@@ p and makes calculations on the basis of an underground area &apos; .
here , they have been able to increase sur@@ ger@@ y , using high @-@ quality materials that add luxury to space .
&quot; the materials are what you are dealing with and thus help to create emotional links with your homes , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you do not love the electricity c@@ ables in my se@@ in .
it is important , but it does not put heart languages ring@@ ing . &quot;
this shows that a good design and an increased surface area help to do something aston@@ ishing from a rather normal cor@@ ps .
in fact , they can even create a desire not to leave , as was the case with Jo@@ anne .
the chief figure , Jen@@ sen , is Ch@@ ic@@ ago , a pe@@ tro@@ man in a pilot night who is competing with a fellow Member because of profession@@ alism .
no more than the amount of money that has been earned , apart from which any ethics is forgotten .
his wife and her three children can only see a man on property and late in the evening .
in the first part of the film , I find myself in the idea that this is a version of the business world - even K@@ ev@@ in S@@ pac@@ ey and Ger@@ ard Bu@@ tle@@ r .
however , what the film goes on , the less cle@@ ric@@ al element remains , and the mor@@ alising intention of film@@ makers is beginning to appear more and more .
life @-@ changing experience leads to cancer for the main contra@@ ctor .
a choice must now be made between work and family life .
the po@@ et dre@@ aming the father &apos;s feet at the Ch@@ ic@@ ago Lar@@ ge buildings to think about matters of real importance such as religion , ch@@ arity , love ... without even mentioning the disaster of the twin sectors .
after the third body in which the po@@ et &apos;s father &apos;s eyes are opened , there is a feeling that film @-@ makers will certainly be exposed to the target , because even the most stu@@ b@@ born specta@@ tor will not be able to hold back te@@ ars when they see the suffering of the cu@@ le cancer patients .
if the po@@ et falls into the House and his situation seems to be almost hope@@ less , the father will once and for all understand the mor@@ ality of his work and do a good job for the elderly .
now , in my own sense , if the film has its own destination , then I would reward my vision after the film coff@@ ee , if I am wrong , then it could be praised for at least one surprise .
for a moment , there is a suspicion that the ice coff@@ ee will be lost - when the hus@@ band hand@@ les a sick person and a man dri@@ ves a si@@ ck@@ ery along a motor@@ way .
however , Po@@ e@@ g has been ama@@ zing , and although his father has just lost his job , it is even positive , because now it is time to deal with the family .
I , too , can feel very well - I can predict the end of the American dra@@ ma quite well .
in truth , film is well constructed , with all the elements required to do so .
there will be a Council , there will be laugh@@ ing , illustra@@ tors will be a good and moral beau@@ ty : money is not the most important thing in life .
this film is well introduced by surprise .
the new Staff Com@@ man@@ der is planning to limit President @-@ in @-@ Office media consumption .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F@@ . Kelly will actually be able to deal with it .
in that case , it would be the first .
Mr Poli@@ tic@@ o wri@@ tes that the new staff chief of the White House intends to limit the flow of information from President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in , including news , in the hope that it will keep the excess in a more balanced way .
here there is a full report from Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ se@@ y@@ an :
&quot; when John F@@ . Kelly met with senior officials on his first day of work , the White House revealed a key problem with President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Val@@ ges Ma@@ in , which he plans to solve the poor flow of information into President Assad &apos;s hands .
Mr Kelly told the officials that the information had to pass through him , either on paper or at meetings , because the President would make better decisions if he was given good information . &quot;
Mr Kelly &apos;s diagnosis seems perfectly logical , but others have also tried to do so and have failed to tame T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i by monitoring its use of the media .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s relationship with television dates back decades and , even now that he is in White Ma@@ in , his television observation habits have not gone anywhere .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen the candidate T@@ ru@@ mp was anno@@ yed for dis@@ honest media coverage , to show him that he was also fairly reflected in the statements affecting him , &apos; said S@@ am N@@ un@@ berg to Poli@@ ti@@ co@@ s in February .
Poli@@ tic@@ o tara Pal@@ mer wrote at the time that , according to the six former campaig@@ ners , T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter is a key factor in the management of ter @-@ habits , to ensure that her individual media consumption is also accompanied by declarations of assurance .
OK .
however , the idea that T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter &apos;s habits have ever been &apos; controlled &apos; is ridiculous .
perhaps those campaig@@ ners will know something that the rest of us do not know that the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i ta@@ g would have been even more hear@@ tening without these interventions .
we will probably never be able to know about sh@@ ut@@ tles that the T@@ ru@@ mp did not announce .
if he was hel@@ ple@@ ss able to save him a few times a few times , his efforts were worth doing so .
no one , however , has been able to prevent T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i from constantly creating po@@ lem@@ ics .
part of the problem is that in the White House , which consists of competing tactics between them , people are trying , without exception , to promote their own interests by transferring material to the T@@ ru@@ el , which supports their world views , but may not always be reliable .
in May , Poli@@ tic@@ o , which reflects the whole course of the story , wri@@ tes the reluctance of the advis@@ ers to inform the President of a strategic interest in feed .
one of the examples described by the repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ ma@@ cher is as follows :
&quot; the current and former T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i sub@@ mits that T@@ ru@@ mp can react to the negative press , with a particularly damaging impact on le@@ af@@ lets , in an explo@@ sive manner , taking as a ob@@ session the identification of their source of origin .
this was also the case at the end of February , when someone dis@@ credi@@ bly gave the President a copy of the Internet provocation , Charles C. G@@ ot@@ New@@ s.@@ com , a website belonging to Joh@@ n@@ son , which accused the de@@ pu@@ tor Ka@@ tie Wal@@ sh@@ i of being a white house &apos; source of multiple le@@ af@@ lets &apos; .
it goes without saying that Joh@@ n@@ son has been permanently blocked from Twitter , or that he did not provide any concrete evidence , or that he has also presented and withdrawn false accusations in the past .
the T@@ ru@@ mp read the article and started to ask for the subject of Wales . &quot;
Gold@@ ma@@ cher added that Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , the then senior Staff Com@@ man@@ der Re@@ ince Pri@@ eb@@ us and head of the White House , had attempted to set up a system for the management and documentation of documents reaching T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in . &quot;
how did it succeed ?
Mr Kelly is trying to do exactly the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader , but the T@@ ru@@ mp is still an impul@@ se , and his assis@@ tant will still compete for influence .
these irre@@ vo@@ cable factors make Mr Kelly &apos;s mission very difficult .
street mus@@ ici@@ ans coming from abroad will not be able to obtain a bitter address .
there are many foreigners in the city of Tallinn .
those with whom the girl came to the fire acknowledged that he was playing in the elderly without the permission of the municipal government .
we first found three street mus@@ ici@@ ans along Vir@@ u &apos;s gates , who had involved the same number of Kore@@ ans .
it was clear to see that mus@@ ici@@ ans with rub@@ ber@@ gs and broken hard@@ lin@@ ers were ab@@ sen@@ sors who would have to spend one du@@ š mar@@ ty@@ rs on .
in spite of the humili@@ ation , the only woman in the company played a tra@@ il in the a@@ cor@@ di@@ ation , while one man , alongside him , called him three Pal@@ lia@@ tions and brought fur@@ ni@@ des closer .
the third man had sat alongside them on one of the do@@ gs and smo@@ ked the cra@@ f@@ ts@@ manship of the far@@ ce himself .
their three cha@@ mbers did not allow themselves to be distur@@ bed by the people who were passing .
Mr Bo@@ b , who has played with Mr No@@ emi and the pal@@ lia@@ tes , said that he was we@@ aring on the streets both for fu@@ n and for money .
the purpose of the event was to collect tickets for a ship travelling to Finland on the same day .
with regard to the question of whether or not they asked for permission from the city for ro@@ tation , No@@ emi and Bo@@ b were sha@@ king their heads .
firstly , we did not know .
secondly , we will never stay in one city for more than a day or a few days , and in most cases they will be granted for a month or so .
it makes no sense to pay for this , &quot; explained by Bo@@ b .
when we came back to the gates of Vir@@ u some 20 minutes later , we saw that two women are in the hands of mus@@ ici@@ ans and are driving them away .
it pa@@ ved with sa@@ cks and bags in ab@@ sen@@ tia to come to gri@@ ps with the Vir@@ u crossing of the Centre .
there were also three Polish young men present on Vir@@ u street , one of whom played a fifth , the other k@@ ni@@ fe , and the third had even contributed to electronic glass .
&quot; we are here to offer people enter@@ tainment in order to spread music and joy , and to earn money for fuel and life , the tri@@ o of the pi@@ pe M@@ iv@@ os@@ h explained .
according to M@@ iv@@ o@@ sh@@ i , they are aware that there must be permission from the City Government .
&quot; of course we do not have it , &quot; he said it jo@@ ke .
but we hope that , when people enjoy our music , there will be no problem .
of course , if the police comes , then we go elsewhere , but you have to try &apos; , he added .
the Estonian bank bought bonds worth EUR 149 million under the Public Pri@@ vate Company Programme of Central Ban@@ ks in the euro area in July , and the Central Bank &apos;s bond portfolio increased to a total of EUR 4.@@ 36 billion .
the Central Bank does not provide more detailed information on purchases .
Estonian bank President Har@@ do H@@ ans@@ son has made it clear in the past that the central bank buy @-@ up scheme for the euro system will cover three different purchasing programmes : covered bonds for the financial sector ( VIS ) , asset @-@ backed bonds ( A@@ B@@ S ) and public debt ( PS@@ PP ) .
the Central Bank will buy bonds from the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere .
the impact of purchases reduces the production of lower @-@ risk assets and encourages investors to take greater risks .
as a general rule , in the framework of the public sector bond exchange programme , each central bank bu@@ ys its own government bonds , and the bonds of other countries are not purchased .
as the Estonian state has not issued bonds , the Estonian bank is making so @-@ called &apos; replacement purchases &apos; within the amount allocated to them .
Central Ban@@ ks will also shop in those countries where the offer of bonds under the purchase scheme is limited .
the Estonian bank generally bu@@ ys the bonds of the European institutions , such as the European Financial Stability Facility ( EFSF ) and the European Investment Bank bonds , confirmed by H@@ ans@@ son .
the Estonian bank will purchase bonds under the asset exchange programme as of March 2015 .
in the meantime , NT@@ Bs were also procu@@ red , but in June 2016 the Estonian bank was no longer able to buy mail bonds .
on behalf of the central banks in the euro area , the Finnish Central Bank bu@@ ys both Ele@@ round and Estonia &apos;s energy bonds from June .
emig@@ ran@@ ts ignore degrees and return to a &apos; mil@@ li@@ on@@ set of millions &apos;

M@@ aru@@ ang@@ y residents have s@@ kir@@ ted at the So@@ pig@@ ul@@ li Council , saying that the Council is &apos; useless to deal with the problem &apos; .
a anon@@ ymous person said : &apos; they cop@@ ied there on Monday evening after they were expelled from Ben@@ tle@@ y He@@ ath@@ y , where they refused to stoning .
the Council must be ashamed to act because they are useless in dealing with the problem .
the migrants were there in May , they were delayed , and now they are back again .
they came to more yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot;
he added : &apos; Bir@@ min@@ g@@ ha@@ m Council knows how to deal with such matters by obtaining long barriers to protect his par@@ ks .
I live on the road of street et@@ s@@ bro@@ o@@ k , and I am not happy that I must continue to pay a mandate if the Council is unable even to block such a thing . &quot;
a local resident who also wanted to be anon@@ ymous also said : &apos; it is ridiculous ; we have only seen the latter leave these travellers , and there is already a new offensive .
this time , there has been an increase in the number , and even a horse has been seen in the grass@@ land . &quot;
representative of the So@@ meat City Council said : &apos; we are aware that there are unacceptable camps in the land near the street et@@ s@@ bro@@ o@@ k road , and we are working with the So@@ one@@ ul@@ li police ; we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible .
the gathering of evidence will be very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any antis@@ o@@ cial or criminal behaviour to the police by phone number 101 .
this will help create a picture of the situation for the court if we present the case to them . &quot;
the We@@ ek@@ na F@@ esti@@ val will , among other things , visit the Minister for Culture , In@@ dre@@ k Sa@@ ar , who is pleased to have been able to bring real world top names to Estonia .
the question of why it is so important for the Est@@ oni@@ ans at the We@@ ek@@ ise F@@ esti@@ val is Sa@@ ar that it should be asked of all those who enjoy three days at the F@@ esti@@ val .
however , he will admit that there have been real players in the area of Per@@ sia .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen you look at the level of the artists that we have been able to bring to Estonia , the absolute top names of this music director will be brought home - this is often not the case in our book &apos; , the Minister for Culture will speak .
which festi@@ val , however , are the artists who speak the most about Sa@@ art itself ?
I consider myself to be relatively old people , and it is certainly one of the most experienced doctors , Ar@@ min van B@@ new@@ re@@ n , who stood up last night .
after all , according to his pos@@ ter , all of us , at some point , have complicated our own feet . &quot;
however , he also highlights a number of names , such as Cha@@ in@@ ester , De@@ ad@@ ma@@ u@@ 5 , K@@ ni@@ fe@@ bels .
of course , our own Estonian players too : starting from NO@@ ţ@@ P , they can be read in a whole series .
in reality , this concentration of well @-@ known names is very high , &quot; he says .

Au@@ di upgra@@ des up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the light of criticism by car manufacturers .
a day before the Au@@ di announcement , B@@ M@@ W said that it provides software for more than 350 000 vehicles .
according to the Chairman of B@@ M@@ W , the company believes that &apos; there are smarter alternatives than driving restrictions &apos; , referring to European cities , including the B@@ M@@ W home city of Munich , which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles .
Da@@ im@@ ler announced on Tuesday an update to reduce emissions from diesel engines by three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe .
none of the companies described these practices as &apos; provocation &apos; .
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions .
however , nitrogen ox@@ ide em@@ itted from diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and may cause as@@ th@@ ma .
at the same time , equipment installed to neutr@@ alise emissions from diesel vehicles will increase the cost of diesel vehicles , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
while German car manufacturers are under an in @-@ depth investigation , Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s government is also accused of ring@@ ing powerful car manufacturers and of ignoring the signs referring to the problem .
companies are trying to prevent Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen from repeating its faul@@ ts , who were silent about the use of so @-@ called pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um devices , which made it possible to adapt exha@@ ust fa@@ res to regulations when testing a car , but returned to normal driving conditions .
a number of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen heads have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic .
in Germany last month , the former head of the Au@@ di engine Development unit was arrested .
former President Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Gi@@ o@@ van@@ ni Pa@@ mi@@ o is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may be brought to justice in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Au@@ di in Germany went into a criminal investigation into Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen when the authorities accused of instal@@ ling the Audit System in order to circum@@ vent the requirements of Europe &apos;s emissions volumes , thereby extending the investigation , which had previously focused on the United States .
the inclusion of the Au@@ di in the investigation may be a major blow to the Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen , a producer of Luxembour@@ luxury cars , disproportionately generating the profits of a large proportion of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen .
Estonian schools will receive 20 000 euro of European Union flags .
by 1 September , the Ministry of Education intends to buy EU flags for Estonian schools to mark the Presidency .
a total of 105@@ x@@ 15@@ 8 c@@ enti@@ metres of the European Union &apos;s flag will be 5@@ 70 education institutions .
Li@@ ps are intended to invest in in@@ doors ; they must also be carried out in high @-@ quality printed in@@ doors with a sense of at@@ testa@@ tion ; the ER@@ R news portal will be facilitated .
on the label , there is a text : &apos; Kin@@ gi@@ tus to Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union .
the estimated cost of 5@@ 70 flags lies at EUR 20 000 in the Ministry of Education , a flag costing EUR 35 .
murder of journalist highlights growing threats in Mexico
the workers of the weekly newspaper , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , usually gather on Wednesday in order to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the state of Blue authorisation , so@@ wed by organised crime , corrupt officials and un@@ stop@@ p@@ able drug wars .
today , however , they have gathered in the shadow of their personal tragedy to discuss their own security .
they are told that it is important to change their ru@@ ins .
two parents &apos; wri@@ ters will be discussing which looks safer : whether to bring children to their office , which was the target of the gran@@ che attack in 2009 , or leave them home .
security experts have written three words to the leader of the room : &apos; enemies &apos; , &apos; neutrality &apos; , &apos; allies &apos; .
they are asking repor@@ ters to give the names of a ve@@ il in every piece of water not to provide evidence in theory , suff@@ ices on impres@@ sions and in@@ ner feelings .
the presence of government or car@@ tels is suspected of being drug traffickers , politicians , business@@ men and journalists alike , of having a full list of couples who make it dangerous to reflect the chaos that exists in Mexico .
violence is not a s@@ tun@@ t , and the more dead people across the country accumu@@ late , the majority of which is made up of journalists from Yemen , according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists , since the resigna@@ tion of President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ş@@ to at least 25 in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 journalists have been under public protection following attacks and threats , and this year at least seven journalists have still died in seven countries .
the most recent deaths include their edit@@ or and source of inspiration , Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as , co @-@ foun@@ der of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce .
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his many reports on drug @-@ related violence .
his absence makes a deep sense , even though his presence can be felt everywhere on the Asian Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Bu@@ il@@ ding , a big picture of Val@@ de@@ z , which shows an average cli@@ p , with a letter entitled &apos; Justice &apos; , and two of the 30@@ n@@ ines repor@@ ters , A@@ ar@@ on I@@ bar@@ ra and M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez , carries T @-@ shir@@ ts , which have been portra@@ yed by his wife @-@ private glas@@ ses , or the face of his pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um .
the meeting will take place less than two months after his death , and pas@@ ters will discuss common trau@@ ma , their n@@ ight@@ m@@ are , their hope@@ lessness , their paran@@ o@@ ia .
in 2010 , although a separate public prosecution service was set up to deal with journalists &apos; cases , only two cases have been prosecuted by the Committee for the Protection of journalists .
like most of the annual drug trafficking and organised crime @-@ related murders , which amount to thousands , the kil@@ lers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s edit@@ orial action continues to reflect the violence in Sin@@ al@@ o@@ a , even though their hearts have been broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous .
without the data and justice of murde@@ rers , the security meeting I@@ bar@@ ra says that there will be a great deal of use .
&quot; it is very nice to waste your time here at the meeting , &quot; he says .
&quot; as long as the reason is not known , everyone will be tr@@ usted . &quot;
Val@@ dez left the office of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the capital of the State , Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , on 15 May morning .
he was able to travel just a few quarters before two men stopped his red To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Co@@ rol@@ la , forcing him to exit the car and shot him 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper , meaning in translation the &apos; twel@@ f@@ th river &apos; .
an armed man was travelling to Val@@ de@@ z in the car and made an accident close to that .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
she was left behind by a woman and two adult children .
there is free circulation in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
however , the subject of Val@@ de@@ z basically lies only in silence .
since the arrest of Gu@@ z@@ man last year and the extradition to the United States in January , the Blue Card has been one of the most bloody bat@@ tle@@ fields in the country , as ri@@ val@@ ries are fighting to fill the power vacuum .
it makes no difference that , on the streets of Blue authorisation , a few people or even a number of people are du@@ mped every day , or that the dead are g@@ rin@@ ding ri@@ d@@ dled from two @-@ fold swe@@ ets of nar@@ co@@ ts , which are greater than many homes living .
let us forget , for a moment , that the time of peace refers to the fact that only one car@@ tel is headed by a maritime state with valuable ports and drugs routes to the United States .
in spite of all this and the fact that Val@@ dez was fully aware of the dangers of his work , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s co @-@ foun@@ der and the President , Is@@ May Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , feels that he was not able to defend his friend .
he believes that the killing was facilitated by two mistakes .
the first of these was the publication in February of an interview with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons of the car@@ tel , which is competing with the sons of Gu@@ z@@ man .
this piece of correspon@@ dence could have been allu@@ ded to by gan@@ gs suspected of being able to buy all cop@@ ies of the publications as soon as they were reached in newspapers .
another mistake was that Val@@ dez was not forced to leave the country in the name of his own security , after a crackdown took place in one of the newspapers with the same story in another .
Val@@ dez was leg@@ alising both in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico .
he had been alive for so long that his friends and colleagues expected him to exist forever .
in 2003 , he served as a ve@@ ter@@ an@@ repor@@ ter report at No@@ ro@@ este , when he joined five colleagues to create Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , sold 50 @-@ dollar shares .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said , &apos; It was impossible to deal with the press without tou@@ ching on the drug problem &apos; .
the newspaper took time to know about its courageous and honest labels , and sales and advertising increased .
Re@@ por@@ ters were keen to publish vigorous studies without fear of censorship and read@@ ers s@@ le@@ ep in a print of which they could read stories that no one else da@@ red to reflect .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the newspaper won the pres@@ ti@@ gious award of Maria Mo@@ ors C@@ ab@@ oti for his demonstrations in Latin America .
in the same year in Val@@ dez , the Committee for the Protection of journalists ( AK@@ K ) won the International Press Freedom Award for its courage to follow Mexic@@ an drug creation wherever it takes .
he openly admitted that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to live on , &quot; he said the AK@@ K award .
last October , in an interview given to the television channel Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ en@@ to TV , he said that drug trafficking is a way of life for you .
&apos;@@ T@@ o take on board the challenge posed by the journalists &apos; office , Peru &apos;s second chance of playing a f@@ ool game .
I do not want to ask me what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I did not say what is going on . &quot;
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce colle@@ lo@@ va stri@@ ves Val@@ de@@ z , a jo@@ ke who ro@@ p@@ pered like mad@@ r@@ us , a friend who gene@@ rously divided embry@@ os and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they gave their support to his rou@@ tine .
he was always we@@ aring his own village .
he went across the office to El Wogau y@@ ab@@ o bar and was always on the same des@@ k .
now they are asking whether his stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ness became fatal to him .
his death has also cast them in doubt as to how best to do his job and stay alive .
&quot; they do not like the arrogance of their women , their children , their legitimate businesses , their secret landing cards used to transport drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things should not have been touched , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result , even in the best times , will be strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ determination .
trus@@ ting your in@@ st@@ inc@@ ts .
if this is a case of suspi@@ ci@@ ously fra@@ ming , the hotel away .
according to Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce edit@@ or And@@ res Vil@@ lar@@ re@@ ali , the problem is that &apos; fra@@ gran@@ ce can be dece@@ ived ... , and so was it with J@@ SE &apos; .
he and others are saying that you no longer have old rules , just as they do not apply in the Ta@@ ma@@ u@@ li@@ k , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Guer@@ re@@ ros or other states , which are home to the po@@ ison@@ ous composition of profitable smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt state officials .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the space in which Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers met for security training , mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed ; a few days before that , it was revealed that only the but@@ ton sold to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
in front of the house , two poli@@ ce@@ men sought a rela@@ xation of 40 degrees .
they were appointed by the government to host the offices of the Re@@ publi@@ can University of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an in a four @-@ day building .
some of the repor@@ ters won@@ dered in a half jo@@ ke whether these police officers belong to the 50 % of the police officers whose Governor himself ha@@ iled un@@ trus@@ t@@ worthy .
several months have el@@ ap@@ sed since the repor@@ ters had travelled to mountainous rural areas where controls are de facto in the hands of drug gan@@ gs .
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s edition of this week dealt with three main features .
one of them was the murder in Y@@ al@@ o@@ a of the former bo@@ x@@ om@@ al@@ leg@@ o Valenci@@ ar Cha@@ vez ven@@ na .
in addition , they had a reve@@ aling story of government funds being spent on the home city of the Governor .
a group of people was kidna@@ pped from Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , one of the most expensive restaur@@ ants .
there was no official announcement of who was kidna@@ pped or how it happened , so it was necessary to be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city of Leic@@ restaur@@ an , both for drug traffickers and for public authorities .
Re@@ por@@ ter learned from public documents that a restaur@@ ant has been registered for the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling institution of the Rev@@ olu@@ tionary Party ( IR@@ P ) , which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the last century .
in recent times , several IR@@ P ku@@ ber@@ ner has been accused of widespread coverage of cases of corruption .
in Vil@@ lar@@ line , the repor@@ ter asked her to write previous incidents in the same place , including how the son of Gu@@ z@@ man , who wear the name of El Chap@@ o , esca@@ ped military bet@@ s .
in just a few months previously , read@@ ers would have been looking for a copy of Val@@ dez in order to obtain information about kidna@@ pping from the best sources .
&quot; in the past , we would have known what happened , &apos; said a 46 @-@ year @-@ old Vil@@ lar@@ line , whose body construction has earned him a ban@@ ner called El Fla@@ co .
&quot; now all the channels of communication have broken down with our sources . &quot;
the Val@@ de@@ z office has become a reser@@ vo@@ id of bridges and stic@@ kers protesting against the killing of journalists , and the edit@@ orial workers have become something they could never wait for activists on behalf of the press .
Re@@ por@@ ter M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez seized a couple of bridges and orientations next morning at the local public Prosecutor &apos;s office for another journalist .
in the western state of Mic@@ ho@@ ac@@ an three days after the killing of Val@@ dez .
it has been found as a dead body and , according to officials , it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests .
journalists from all over the country have become more vo@@ cal and underline the phrase &apos; S@@ OS press &apos; as organised prote@@ sters on pa@@ vements and buildings .
on this day in Washington , President Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez will have the opportunity to gather international support for justice in the Val@@ dez case .
a day after the death of Val@@ de@@ z , when he met with Y@@ our licence Governor , Ra@@ mi@@ rez accused the authorities of c@@ rying out for journalists and killing them for telling the truth .
after that , he asked for he to be diver@@ ted from government action elsewhere , concerned that hatred has affected objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had said on repeated occasions that Mexic@@ an journalists were &apos; restricted &apos; by organised crime , co @-@ guilty state officials and an indifferent society .
in his last book &apos; drug media &apos; , he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killed by drug gan@@ gs , but also carried out under the command of politicians and security forces who are at the mer@@ cy of organised crime .
Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 , the Media Monitoring Group , awarded more than half of the attacks by journalists on the police and public officials last year .
&apos;@@ In Mexico you happen , because you want to keep quiet , &apos; Ra@@ mi@@ rez said .
there will obviously be a bloody impact .
no one will forget the death of the blo@@ g@@ ger , Maria E@@ liz@@ abeth Ma@@ ci@@ as , in the northern border state in Ta@@ ma@@ u@@ li@@ k six years ago .
she was found dead with a letter which was probably signed by the car@@ tel L@@ OS Z@@ e@@ tas : &apos; I am here for my repor@@ ters &apos; .
the computer glass offices and e@@ lep@@ han@@ ts han@@ ged alongside his bel@@ o@@ ved head .
some of the publications have decided to close their doors , for example , in the northern border state of El Nor@@ te , Chi@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ a , following the killing of their correspon@@ dent Aung sla@@ va B@@ atti@@ hi in March .
others will pass on as the newspaper El Man@@ ana de Nu@@ ev@@ o L@@ are@@ do did after the murder of their president in 2004 .
in 2010 , the newspaper Di@@ ari@@ o de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug car@@ tel with the edit@@ orial &apos; What do you want ? &apos;
some journalists have fled their home states , or even their country .
it is a ner@@ v@@ ous decision .
in theory , it is difficult to find a job , and they still have to bo@@ ast today in order to avoid dangers .
and sometimes behind them , as was probably the case with photo@@ graph@@ i Ru@@ be@@ n E@@ sp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered three months after Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z in 2015 , together with four women in Mexico , in 2015 .
those who remain in place and continue to work will have to refu@@ te risky decisions on a daily basis .
someone who once wanted to become a po@@ et ad@@ mits that reflection of the drug business frigh@@ tens him .
&quot; Mexico is on its way to hell , and that is why I am going to report , &quot; he said .
at the mid@@ night of one recent Friday , when the latest number had already been cut off , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s edit@@ or swe@@ pt the office on a pa@@ per@@ work and be@@ ating be@@ er when all telephone lines suddenly commen@@ ced .
in Ma@@ z@@ at@@ lan@@ is , a sta@@ ggering cu@@ mber@@ some city , 19 people were killed according to valida@@ ted data in fire exchanges between ri@@ val gan@@ gs and security forces .
the war es@@ cor@@ t continued , just as a number of messages retained by car@@ tels found in the area were also promised .
according to the same pa@@ vements , repor@@ ters issued news on the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce site using a mobile phone .
in the front of next day there was a need to change .
the scen@@ es seized another fire exchange in the Maghreb region .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez pi@@ beau@@ ty stood up for police officers to see whether they are vigilant .
if they fea@@ red , they did not at least show this .
workers of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce were posted in his foot@@ steps under massive ban@@ kno@@ tion , where his average finger can be seen for the whole of your mother tongue .
&apos;@@ Ho@@ w could you think about closure at all , &apos; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez &apos; on the same day that Javier Solana was slaugh@@ tered , a trainees@@ hip asked me to report to the streets ? &apos;
D@@ in@@ osa@@ ur@@ us used protective colour in order to avoid enemies
at first g@@ lance , it looks like a form , albeit rather frigh@@ tening .
scientists have now unve@@ iled the first findings concerning the existence of un@@ beli@@ evable rub@@ b@@ ish numbers discovered by Canadian min@@ ers , which has so well preserved that the experts have described it as &apos; din@@ osa@@ ences Mon@@ a Lis@@ a &apos; .
it has maintained so well that it was even possible to find out that the sk@@ in covered by his so@@ us@@ s was a bun@@ ch of col@@ ours , and his past had been somewhat &apos; complicated &apos; .
a report published in a magaz@@ ine published by Health Bi@@ ology described status as &apos; the best preserved so@@ om@@ al@@ din@@ osa@@ ur that has ever been found &apos; and &apos; one of the best Cur@@ ricul@@ um read@@ ings worldwide &apos; .
in the case of fossil fuels , it is a new category of no@@ do@@ dge that lived in the middle of the seas@@ ond era , from 110 to 112 million years ago .
its incredibly good retention in Rab@@ a was carried out by theat@@ res who describe it as &apos; truly significant &apos; .
according to National Ge@@ o@@ theory , this type of ph@@ os@@ ph@@ orus , which has ever been found , has been the best preserved as part of the me@@ als covered .
it was found on 21 March 2011 by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he extra@@ cted Sun@@ c@@ or Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um in For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray near Northern Alber@@ tas in Canada .
it hit something that did not recall the passion surrounding it and decided to look into more detail .
identified ph@@ os@@ ph@@ orus was sent to the Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell Pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ology muse@@ um .
for the next six years , an animal was designed to extra@@ ct 2 500 p@@ ounds ( 1@@ 100 kilometres ) from the land unit .
after all this hard work , the end result will now finally be ready to bring the public ahead .
&apos;@@ I@@ f you put a bit of a blind eye , you can almost believe he is s@@ lee@@ ping , &apos; said Cal@@ e@@ b Brown , the edit@@ or Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell in the muse@@ um in which he is s@@ tun@@ ned .
&quot; this goes down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osa@@ ur - din@@ osa@@ ur Mon@@ a Lis@@ ana . &quot;
when studying his sk@@ in , she found out that this vege@@ tation session , which is covered by so@@ aps and rese@@ mb@@ les di@@ visi@@ ve tan@@ k , was likely to pose a significant threat to meat @-@ food comp@@ ounds .
it used a red and white sense of protection to hide from pre@@ da@@ tors and applied shel@@ tering techniques , which are referred to as &apos; shelter &apos; and which are also used by many modern animals .
it made it possible , according to the experts , to enter the din@@ osa@@ ur better , and to avoid enemies , as the major din@@ osa@@ urs were likely to hun@@ t him .
for the first time in May , the presence of a family of no@@ do@@ sa@@ t@@ olo@@ gis@@ ts aged 110 million went into news and is now visited in the Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell Pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ology muse@@ um .
the theat@@ res have now looked at the existence and gave it the name of the Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta Mar@@ mit@@ chel@@ li muse@@ um mark Mitchell , which spent more than 7 000 hours in order to reveal the suffering .
thanks to the ama@@ zing survival of his father , Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists have been able to document the shape and size of Fin@@ ns .
they found refuge - a common method of protection in the animal state - which means that the title of existence was the har@@ sh@@ est as the lower .
even though there has been a lack of objec@@ tivity , findings come as a surprise , as Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta is much greater than those living today with def@@ ective animals .
this suggests that din@@ osa@@ ur pressure was sufficiently inten@@ tionally hun@@ ted by other comp@@ ound comp@@ ounds , that ev@@ olu@@ tions were preferred instead of being a survi@@ ving ta@@ ctic , instead of hiding apart from confrontation .
however , most of the animals used today , such as fear , se@@ als or me@@ als , are far smaller and more vulnerable , indicating that no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur@@ us had had to make a real effort to survive .
&quot; the vigorous cooling @-@ off of the din@@ osa@@ ur , covered by massive and abundan@@ t so@@ aps , shows how dangerous it might have been to pre@@ da@@ tory animals in the seas@@ on@@ ic era , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic comp@@ ounds of diabe@@ tes also revealed that a din@@ osa@@ ur &apos;s sk@@ in was a red ba@@ g .
scientists will continue to provide an investigation in order to get ang@@ les about this life , including retained content of this style of salt , in order to find out what the animal is the last word .
they believe that the din@@ osa@@ ur has fallen into the dead rivers , thereby entering the sea , where he had sun@@ k in front of the ocean .
at the time , Alber@@ ta was just as warm as now in South Flor@@ ence , and rivers and oceans were likely to extend far further to the internal land than now .
&quot; this no@@ do@@ sa@@ ur@@ us is truly significant , since it has fully preserved so@@ us@@ tic sk@@ in , but it has also remained three dimensions while preserving the original shape , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; as a result of this , the animal today looks almost the same as in the seas@@ on@@ ic age .
to recon@@ stru@@ ct this , it does not need to have a great deal of imagination to use - it is enough simply to run bridges and it seems to be like s@@ lee@@ ping . &quot;
there was a time of crisis in which mus@@ cles - he@@ tero@@ han@@ ts - were s@@ tun@@ ned in the land , with huge increases in meat ea@@ ten .
even though their Qu@@ e@@ en Ty@@ ran@@ no@@ sa@@ ur@@ us re@@ x lived many millions more years later than Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta , some of his frigh@@ tening predecess@@ ors could have hun@@ ted out of this as@@ tron@@ om@@ ic din@@ osa@@ ur .
these include A@@ cro@@ can@@ tho@@ sa@@ ur@@ u , 38 leg@@ s ( 11.@@ 5 metres ) , a long and six @-@ tonne mon@@ ster .
scientists whose recent findings have been published in the Bi@@ ology magaz@@ ine believe that Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta u@@ hu@@ ta was s@@ tun@@ ned after death in the sea and that this mu@@ z@@ ine was mu@@ tu@@ alised .
on 21 March 2011 , Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k was detected when he extra@@ cted from For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray to northern Alber@@ tas in the Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um mine in Canada .
according to Mu@@ use@@ um , it is best preserved by so@@ om@@ om@@ al@@ sis in the world , including s@@ kin@@ s and so@@ oms , and it is comprehensive from concentration to wood .
these percen@@ tages were , on average , 18 leg@@ s ( five metres ) long and fixed up to GBP 3 000 ( 1 300 kg ) .
there were two 20 customs qu@@ eu@@ es out of it .
scientists believe that , through the present Western Canada , this hi@@ jac@@ ked vege@@ tation comp@@ ound , the river that was floo@@ ded in the high seas was proud of .
however , the place of absor@@ bing a din@@ osa@@ ur at sea helped to maintain its characteristics in an excellent detail .
the gla@@ ci@@ ers of this particular father , coal , have so well preserved that the my@@ g@@ arch@@ ical H@@ om@@ os@@ s continue to cover sk@@ in gla@@ ci@@ ers .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wri@@ tes in the National Ge@@ o@@ sian magaz@@ ine : &apos; such sta@@ teh@@ ood is just as rare as lo@@ to@@ victory .
the more I see it , the more incredible it seems .
the bur@@ nt sk@@ in gla@@ ci@@ ers are still covered by my@@ ster@@ y sto@@ res located in the y@@ el@@ low .
a better front is lying next to him , and the way in which five properties are si@@ len@@ ced .

how did one activist find an answer to the question of &apos; whose thanks ? &apos;
on 9 August 2014 , Bri@@ t@@ tan@@ y Ferre@@ ll received complete shock .
just a few days after the trip to New York , that was the birth@@ place of St@@ . Lou@@ ka Air@@ b@@ n@@ b on a le@@ ak@@ ed bed , travelling on Facebook a phone .
he came on top of the post of his former school compan@@ i@@ ons .
it said : &apos; the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old ad@@ ole@@ sc@@ ents , and he is still on the streets &apos; .
he was confused as to why nobody else had outs@@ our@@ ced this information from his stream , so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
P@@ ide@@ ga @ The@@ e@@ P@@ Mil@@ ah &apos;s user &apos;s mail had been handed over several times on his line of time .
Mr St@@ . Sy@@ ri@@ p@@ equality from the region of Lou@@ ise provided real @-@ time sh@@ ut@@ tles to Michael Brown , the death of an un@@ armed 18 @-@ year @-@ old black man who was killed by Mr Fer@@ gus@@ on Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is White police officer .
he gave a picture of the life of Brown in a woman who was present on the street , living there for four hours .
&quot; it is cra@@ zy , &quot; said Ferre@@ ll addi@@ tions .
however , death was nothing new for him or for the community .
he put his phone off , but later this evening , he looked back at a ta@@ g announcing the arrival of people in Can@@ field D@@ ri@@ ve .
Mr J@@ ag@@ ati photo@@ graph@@ s of the police and the harsh people and a man who claimed to be the father of Bro@@ w@@ n and kept the &apos; Fer@@ gus@@ on police killed just my un@@ armed son ! &apos; .
he watched in real time a stream in which the poli@@ ce@@ man stood before a group of prote@@ sters with a hat@@ ching house .
in another video , another police officer , he said : &apos; I kill you all ... animals &apos; .
Mr Fer@@ rell reminds him of the way in which he struck himself from the point of view : &apos; this is unusual &apos; .
&quot; this is not the kind of murder we are ac@@ custo@@ med to and which we could describe as typical . &quot;
I was horri@@ fied at this point .
I was ang@@ ry and advised . &quot;
he boo@@ ked a return flight and went home next day .
having bu@@ ried at 23 : 00 , he went to his father for his six @-@ year da@@ u@@ ghter and decided that they would travel to Fer@@ gus@@ on next morning .
what took place next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ li and Fer@@ gus@@ on will be a central issue in the new docu@@ mentary &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street ? &apos; ( &apos; whose thanks ? &apos; ) , to be presented in cine@@ mas on 11 August .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and defeat , strength and resilience from the point of view of those who live in this community and who took up the streets by asking for answers .
when Mr Ferreira , together with a da@@ u@@ ghter - who had a li@@ ps@@ y stic@@ ker in the supermarkets and a ch@@ at with it - went on to Fer@@ gus@@ on , they once again talked about a subject that had come before them many times before this morning - the experience and living conditions of black people .
&quot; do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights ? &quot;
&quot; we are currently travelling to Fer@@ gus@@ on because the police killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old boys , and that is not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take him on board , &quot; said Ferre@@ ll later .
&quot; what is happening now is ... the cul@@ mination of what happened in the past .
it needs to know and see this and grow in the middle of it .
it needs to learn about a activists and organisation , and at the same time know the different la@@ yers of experience and living conditions of the Muslim people , and what we need to do in order to be free and free .
even if I manage to raise him in such a way that he does not personally copy brutal racism , he does not differ from another black girl .
I feel I would be doing him a dis@@ service if I were to protect him from this world . &quot;
the first stop they did in the vic@@ inity of Fer@@ gus@@ oni was by the South Flor@@ is@@ san@@ ti - in the filling of the police stations , which had become a kind of camps where activists were waiting for news about the police officer Dar@@ re@@ n Wil@@ son , who was not ultimately charged with charges .
there , Mr Ferreira and his da@@ u@@ ghter united forces with the local business owner , who prepared the southern islands .
they brought together food homes and helped to spread them to the prote@@ sters .
for Fer@@ rel@@ li , a new type of activist was slow to take shape .
&quot; my activist changed completely after 9 August , &quot; he said , saying that when he was a student at Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i @-@ St@@ . Lou@@ ise University , he was the President of the Alliance for Young students and focused on food justice and health inequalities in Muslim communities .
&quot; I had no experience of organisation .
all of this was just la@@ isse@@ z &apos;@@ ê@@ tre &apos; .
weeks later , at the time of the Ferreira evening demonstration , she met a film co @-@ director , Sab@@ aa@@ h Fo@@ la@@ yan@@ a .
Fo@@ lay@@ an said that he and the film operator , Lucas Al@@ var@@ ad@@ o @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r , simply wanted to document what is happening .
in the face of Fer@@ rel@@ li , the question came : &apos; are you trying to document what is happening or find a story that can be exploited ? &apos;
such scepticism was due to countless cases in which people - often white - come to the community and try to take advantage of its protein and resilience .
Fo@@ lay@@ an explained in a recent interview : &apos; we had heard that the voice of people born and growing in Fer@@ gus@@ on would not be heard , and we wanted to do so differently &apos; .
Fo@@ lay@@ an had already put his hand in hand with D@@ am@@ on Da@@ v@@ ati , an ar@@ tist in the region who was well @-@ known for activists in connection with prisoners who were sentenced to death .
his involvement made the project attractive for Fer@@ rel@@ li and the other six others , who were followed by a team of W@@ ho@@ se street ets for years following the shooting of Brown .
&quot; in this docu@@ mentary , nobody speaks for us or for us , but we speak to ourselves , &quot; said Da@@ vis .
&quot; it was important for me how these people are portra@@ yed , because that is how I am portra@@ yed . &quot;
although the aim was not to focus on the experience of Fer@@ rel@@ li - the intention was to show that the Movement is not about &apos; donor leader , but about bringing together the community &apos; , as Mr Fo@@ lay@@ an said - he made the most open part of the film .
as a result , &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street ets ? &apos; , surpris@@ ingly personal aspects of the life of Fer@@ rell , such as ru@@ th@@ fulness and marriage with his wife .
&quot; I felt as if I had started , &quot; said Ferre@@ ll , saying the first time in which he saw the urban works ready .
&quot; however , I have realised that there must be a certain vulnerability to this work and to the human@@ isation of black people . &quot;
what is more , Fer@@ rell &apos;s story emphasises and puts again the role of black L@@ GB@@ T women in the wider Black Sea Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three initi@@ ators of the movement , who thought in the social media about the killing of the black teen@@ ag@@ ers , Tra@@ y@@ von Martin , in 2012 , of the h@@ ash@@ ta@@ g # Bla@@ ck@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter , are homosexu@@ als .
&quot; the leading role played by black homosexu@@ als has kept the movement across the board , &quot; said Ferreira , and this is precisely because we must constantly fight on several fronts .
Mus@@ tan@@ a@@ bad homosexu@@ als have to bear all this burden . &quot;
Fo@@ lay@@ an agreed , pointing out that &apos; movement is indeed alive for black women , and many of them black homosexu@@ als &apos; .
at the same time , he says that &apos; this is not something of a kind to create equal opportunities &apos; - Fer@@ rell was not chosen as a film centre because of his identity .
&quot; he was a man of whom the right energy was evening , &quot; he said .
&quot; however , it is not a coincidence that he went directly on the front@@ line , as black L@@ GB@@ T women are much at stake when living in such hu@@ bs .
his energy can be perceived through the screen . &quot;
at the same time , news camer@@ as from Fer@@ gus@@ on have long disappeared , but racial links between the community and the police remain fragile .
the conditional sentences imposed on Fer@@ rell at the time of the demonstration for blocking the road las@@ ts for 2.5 years .
he describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere in the region he calls home simply as a &apos; huge threat &apos; .
nonetheless , it still attaches importance to the man@@ tra that it has been eating memory since it took to the streets of Fer@@ gus@@ on a whole three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing more to lose than our chains . &quot;
7 examples of how to overcome the We@@ ek@@ ise du po@@ pp@@ y
some of the more frequent me@@ chan@@ gers , even after a little bit of pi@@ les , find themselves suffering from , hence help .
or on the basis of the words &apos; Ho@@ w a po@@ ta@@ que &apos; , the cra@@ dle of the stick .
however , this is only an inevitable postponement and a decent ble@@ s@@ sing for health .
what can you do in order , after today and tomorrow &apos;s We@@ ek@@ ise tr@@ all - or whatever - to feel better on this morning and to overcome po@@ pp@@ y as pain@@ fully as possible ?
Jo@@ o Water .
for alcohol and vice versa , after a great deal of pi@@ pe in the morning ... or possibly even alcohol .
as the body loses a lot of liquids when it comes to alcohol consumption , it has to be recovered in some way .
miner@@ als are also thrown out of the body with water , and se@@ sta@@ p is a good ha@@ ir of mineral water .
since , after being thrown off , swe@@ pt up , swe@@ ets are often irri@@ tated , it is particularly good if it is bub@@ ble @-@ free , or only easy to legislate .
let us walk away .
it would certainly not cost a bo@@ y to split trees into the grand@@ mother - it might prove fatal to be a false decision .
however , an easy walk @-@ out helps the body to remember once again what sense it is in life .
S@@ lee@@ ping in T@@ el@@ gis and s@@ lee@@ ping boys is a more time @-@ consuming way to become a whole .
give poor energy back gradually and cau@@ ti@@ ously .
if you are on the ver@@ ge of over@@ drinking from yesterday , then it is certainly not worth trying to charge a heavy fat .
for example , a fresh pi@@ pe containing fruit f@@ ab@@ ric@@ s as a body is set up qui@@ et@@ ly .
if health is already suffering in the South , it would be possible , for example , to try the w@@ ed@@ dings .
and , a little later , there will be clarity .
a ref@@ e@@ ree was avoided .
this di@@ u@@ re ta@@ cho@@ m will free the body from the last water .
as has already been said , water and volume are your friends .
it makes a contribution to pain@@ kil@@ lers .
if you are to be pain@@ kil@@ ler in order to prevent po@@ pp@@ y in the evening , you will have to deal not only with alcohol , but also with par@@ at@@ se@@ ta@@ l or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ pro@@ v , and so will it disappear .
so many more h@@ its and , in the future , boys will be worse .
in addition , pain@@ kil@@ lers do not remain in the coff@@ ers for a very long time .
if you take a pain@@ kil@@ ler in the morning , let us do it with an empty piece - it anno@@ ys your already ti@@ red swe@@ at .
or if you do not have a partner , you can do well with you .
there is something like wal@@ king , but there will be no qu@@ an@@ tum leap when you walk .
however , too active a pace and an outrageous bet were avoided : the physical effort should be moder@@ ating during the po@@ pp@@ y season .
the road jo@@ ke .
the words of friends of the time , friends of friends of friends of friends of the past , pa@@ tern@@ alism and Naz@@ is friendly about both himself and others ( suffering ) .
N@@ ali and laugh@@ ter may not make a po@@ cket , but it is certainly easier for them to follow .
for once , the bo@@ y goes over anyway !
University of North@@ w@@ ester@@ n profes@@ sors and Ox@@ ford workers are sought as suspects in murder .
according to the police , a professor of the University of North@@ w@@ ester and the University of Ox@@ ford are being sought nation@@ ally , who have received suspi@@ ci@@ ons following the deadly pet@@ ty pet@@ ty w@@ ives of male people to find one of Ch@@ ic@@ ago &apos;s luxury facilities .
according to judicial documents by C@@ oo@@ k &apos;s coun@@ ty , on Monday , arrests were issued for 42 @-@ year @-@ old W@@ yn@@ d@@ ha@@ m La@@ them@@ i and 56 @-@ year @-@ old Andrew War@@ ren@@ i , accused of being murdered at first instance in T@@ ren@@ ton H. Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ han@@ u .
according to the documents , 26 @-@ year @-@ old Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ han@@ u died after repeated na@@ ils .
according to the warning that Ch@@ ic@@ ago &apos;s police station issued to the community , the dece@@ ased was found on 27 July .
police officers received telephone calls and found a victim whose body had several tow@@ ers for the arrival of the Grand Pla@@ za Cor@@ ter@@ house .
according to the officials , the Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ han@@ u events were sentenced to death , and the investi@@ g@@ ators are treating rape as a murder , while the police are actively looking for two suspects .
Mrs La@@ vid has been working as co @-@ profes@@ sors of micro @-@ bi@@ ology and immun@@ ology at the University of North@@ w@@ ester since 2007 .
Ala@@ n K@@ . C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge , Vice @-@ President of University Public Relations , said in a statement sent as an e @-@ mail that La@@ dows have now been temporarily removed from work and that he is forbid@@ den to enter the towns of the University of North@@ w@@ ester .
&quot; this is now a criminal investigation by the competent authorities , and the University of North@@ w@@ ester works with the investi@@ g@@ ators , &quot; said C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge .
W@@ arre@@ n is a senior assis@@ tant in the financial department at the University of Ox@@ ford .
the representative of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement : &apos; we have been in contact with the British police and ready to assist US research authorities in every way possible &apos; .
in addition , the statement stated that War@@ ren@@ i colleagues were shocked and would like him to present himself .
An@@ th@@ ony G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , Head of the Communications Department of Ch@@ ic@@ ago , urges the authorities , with suspicion .
&quot; the police have an idea of where they are present , but we are dealing increasingly intensively with defining the exact where@@ ab@@ outs , &quot; said G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
according to G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , suspects will be helped by local , regional and national authorities .
G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m said that the police had received telephone calls from the Grand Pri@@ x Cor@@ ter@@ house , who had just received a k@@ ry@@ p@@ tic allu@@ de that there has been something happening in Cor@@ ps No 10@@ 08 .
according to the police , it was a specta@@ cular specta@@ cle .
according to G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , it is not clear whether the event itself was also taking place on 27 July .
he said that security camer@@ as confirm the presence of La@@ them@@ i and War@@ ren@@ i in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor La@@ th@@ a@@ res and the victim had a relationship , &quot; added G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
the Grand Pri@@ x leadership sent a letter to the people : &apos; the police is currently working to find a background to events and victims , and is looking at various mo@@ tives , including the possibility of a family dispute &apos; .
firms that help your businesses avoid becoming next U@@ b@@ B
A@@ my Er@@ re@@ tt wanted to measure the satisfaction of workers in his e @-@ commerce start @-@ ups , but the polls were fu@@ tile .
the answers were often vague , useless or , worse still , misleading .
and even if he promised anon@@ y@@ mity , some workers did not trust this process .
&quot; this system was simply not consistent and objective , &quot; said Er@@ re@@ tt , who is leading the company Mad@@ ison Re@@ ed , which sel@@ ls e @-@ commerce products with 75 employees in San Franc@@ is@@ co@@ s .
so he called on external actors to help .
start @-@ ups with new types of human resources are disappe@@ aring , helping businesses to find out what their workers feel .
by developing and licen@@ sing software to measure the involvement of workers , they enable companies to carry out f@@ lash surveys , target specific teams and demographic groups , offer anon@@ y@@ mity for workers and complaint hot@@ lines and , in some cases , allow in@@ sure@@ rs to by@@ pass &apos; C level management &apos; and address the Bureau directly .
&apos;@@ There are now tools such as Stra@@ va and F@@ it@@ ler , which are meant to monitor health , but where is F@@ it@@ bi for your company ? &apos; asked Jim Bar@@ net@@ t , co @-@ foun@@ der and CE@@ O Reding City start @-@ ups G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ sts are used by companies to measure the inclusion of workers .
according to Er@@ ret@@ ti , he has received a much better overview of what he thinks and knows in three years when he has used G@@ lin@@ ti .
in addition to investigations and specific team studies , it provides for a company &apos;s heating card , which provides an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest level of support , enabling them to identify the causes .
companies have started to understand that they have to stay in touch with their culture of work so as not to become the next U@@ b@@ SR , which has been tor@@ n up in scandals since the former worker published a blo@@ g mail which described the harassment of those who da@@ red to take the floor .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ poultry , the desire to have an overview is a lu@@ cra@@ tive business option .
global governance , regulation and conformity can be worth more than USD 118@@ .@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to a website of financial ethics statistics .
Den@@ ver@@ is Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o &apos;s start @-@ up company communautaire , which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour , observed an interest and an increase in activity this year against the backdrop of the dubious reputation of U@@ beria .
FIF@@ c@@ enti@@ l has almost 600 customers , including Airbus , Microsoft and T@@ es@@ la .
U@@ ber has recently registered himself as a customer .
like G@@ lin@@ les , Covenant companies will be able to send tailor @-@ made impul@@ se polls , collect confidential answers in real time and look at the problematic areas of heat cards .
it will also provide a anon@@ ymous message book which will enable workers to report inappropriate behaviour .
and when it comes to the executive director , complaints go directly to the Bureau .
&quot; public opinion is an@@ cho@@ red by the regulatory authorities , &quot; Chris Qu@@ in@@ lan , foun@@ der and CE@@ O , said Agenda cen@@ ti .
Qu@@ in@@ lan said that if a company is found to treat its workers badly or to act une@@ th@@ ically , it could face serious consequences , such as consumer boycot@@ ts , the departure of workers and court cases , even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene .
Ru@@ by flu , restaur@@ ant , which has more than 25 000 employees in 500 places of activity , has been used for more than a year , in order to ensure workers &apos; awareness of the rules and procedures and to provide an easy way of communicating with the corpor@@ ation headquarters .
when an employee wanted to announce the problem earlier , he had to find a telephone number or an email address at the company headquarters , he had to make a formal complaint and hope that it will be taken seriously .
this was often a da@@ m@@ ning and in@@ convenient process , James Vit@@ ran@@ o , the general advis@@ er of Ru@@ by theory , said that there was no good way of monitoring workers &apos; complaints .
however , at a time when the company is using modulation , problems such as discrimination , harassment or unfair wage practices , which did not end up in the past with leaders operating in offices located in other cities or states , can be identified and dealt with more quickly .
&quot; I have the opportunity to get closer to the hol@@ low experience of the workers of 3@@ 60 degrees , &quot; said Vit@@ ran@@ o , who chairs Ru@@ by hood &apos;s risk management group .
&quot; and we will protect our shareholders from legal disputes with workers . &quot;
Qu@@ in@@ lan said that companies started to take ethical behaviour , values and employee involvement more seriously in 2002 , after the collapse of the audit company Ar@@ th@@ ur Ander@@ sen due to ethical violations in relation to the En@@ r@@ on scandal .
however , only when &apos; social media became mature &apos; did companies realise that they could not prevent their black@@ ma@@ iling from being hi@@ jac@@ ked online .
&quot; before using the technology to monitor ethical behaviour , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Acc@@ cent offer their software as a service by making companies pay perio@@ dic@@ ally for the use of their products .
this is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have been supporting both start @-@ ups .
Acc@@ cen@@ ti financed USD 10 million in February by companies such as S@@ ap@@ ph@@ ire Ven@@ tures and Customs Capital , thereby increasing the value of the capital collected by EUR 47 million .
G@@ lin@@ ti invested USD 10 million in November , B@@ es@@ se@@ mer Ven@@ ture partners , increasing the company &apos;s total funding to USD 60 million .
investments of this kind do not come as a surprise if we take into account the inter@@ conne@@ c@@ tedness of companies , culture and venture capital .
more and more research shows that today &apos;s workers expect more jobs than before .
in more competitive markets , such as S@@ ili@@ c@@ on Val@@ ley , high wages and interesting projects are merely on the table .
the workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and devote their time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy in the company , they feel that they are listening to them and that the work they do is satis@@ fying , they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company , &quot; said N@@ ina Mc@@ Qu@@ e@@ en , Vice @-@ President L@@ in@@ ke@@ d@@ In@@ is , who has general benefits and staff experience .
investors make a profit if their portfolio companies do a good job ; businesses do well when workers are committed and involved .
if the analy@@ sts on the third side promise to increase the commitment and involvement of workers , then it is not the case that they receive support .
it is important , according to experts in the field of worker inclusion , to have data on worker inclusion .
however , these data will be useless if the company monitors do nothing to do with them .
in fact , when a company asks its employees for feedback , it can lead to expectations that change is ahead of us .
and if changes do not take place quickly enough or not at all , they could cause disappointment and decrease the involvement of workers .
&quot; if you ask 4 000 proposals , you have to be ready for 4 000 conver@@ sa@@ tions , &quot; the President of the consul@@ tancy and business administration , K@@ ot@@ ter International , R@@ us@@ sell Ra@@ ath , who has seen companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection .
&quot; because if things do not stop , then the workers will think : &apos; did you actually listen to me ?
do you care ?
and if you do not care , why should I care ? &apos;
according to Er@@ ret@@ ti , the Mad@@ ison Re@@ e@@ val , which is now carrying out six studies among workers , has been able to implement measures on the same day as the problem has been reported via G@@ lin@@ ti .
and , after receiving feedback from disappointed workers on the pace of decision making and the quality of communication , he was able to re@@ organise several teams in the company and provide communication training to deal with the problems .
however , Ru@@ by Cameroon is collecting new data on workers and it is hoped that , in the long term , it will result in a longer @-@ term commitment of workers in industry known for its massive turnover .
&quot; if you are not committed to ensuring transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ ran@@ o .
&quot; if you lose people , you will lose customers .
and if you lose customers , you will lose businesses . &quot;
euro area stag@@ na@@ ting mark is Bal@@ tics : incomes grow rapidly
although the crisis in 2008 and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on Bali , the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe , with reference to the report by the European Central Bank .
according to the Central Bank , since 1999 , total economic output per capita has exceeded expectations in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
there are low debt burdens , fast @-@ growing institutions and business @-@ friendly and free market @-@ friendly policies behind success .
&quot; the Baltic States , together with Slovakia , are among the few countries in the euro area , where the EU average has been substantially closer to the purchasing power system . &quot; said the Central Bank .
although the aim is that total economic output per capita compared to the richer Western Europe , in 2015 , the total output of the Baltic economies per capita amounted to just 2 / 3 / 15 countries representing the European Union before the enlargement of 2004 .
low wages have led them to seek better wages abroad .
although the European Central Bank sees Bali in a positive light and the economy grow@@ s this year , the local population is not enthusiastic at all .
according to the latest Eurobarometer survey , only one quarter of the population of Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies are going very well or rather well .
in the Czech Republic and Poland it was thought little less about the economies of their own countries than half of those questioned .
N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s decision to cancel two @-@ day trends makes Bru@@ in@@ si &apos;s days long .
it is almost 23 o &apos;@@ clock when thro@@ mb@@ ond U@@ C@@ L@@ A foot@@ bal@@ lers stop talking at the end of a new exercise at the University of the team .
some of them have put a burden on the back of their company , reve@@ aling their efforts for the first day of the training camp .
for a large part of the team , these gang minutes offer mid@@ day couples .
the players taking part in cu@@ cu@@ mbers will go back after three hours to the common scene , before returning to meetings at 6.@@ 30 next morning in W@@ andar@@ man &apos;s foot@@ wear .
&quot; the next three days will be a real challenge for them , &quot; said Jim Mor@@ a , the Bru@@ in@@ si tre@@ ghter , a little before the Monday took Tuesday .
N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s decision to cancel two times a day to reduce the burden on players has , in fact , made their days longer - at least until the end of the win@@ ds - to one side of the day on Friday .
for this reason , the three first operations of U@@ C@@ L@@ A were prompted to start at 19.@@ 15 in order to fit players into an already tight time@@ line .
the transition from two strikes a day means more one day - the beginning of the Bru@@ in@@ si training camp was raised almost a week ahead compared with the previous season and , for the first time in Mor@@ a &apos;s six W@@ es@@ tw@@ ood season , there will be workshops during summer courses .
they intend to have 18 tr@@ eng@@ ths until 20 August before starting formal preparations for the opening game against T@@ ex@@ as A &amp; M to take place in September .
according to Mor@@ a , he is in favour of a change to the N@@ CA@@ A rule , even though it adds another item to the close schedu@@ les of players .
&quot; they have an enormous burden three or four days , and this is a serious challenge , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; and they break through this challenge ; they are struggling , they are nice young people .
I believe that , when we arrive on Saturday and we have more time , it will be really a little bit . &quot;
when the camp is closed , the U@@ C@@ L@@ A training operations will be closed , which is not an easy task , however , given a clear view of the par@@ king record close to their fields and of the by@@ passing L@@ us@@ kin@@ i centre , a higher @-@ class hotel that has already esca@@ ped off the net of protection around the gates .
since this weekend , ho@@ tel Bru@@ in@@ si players are occupying , but Mor@@ a recognised that there could be problems with free tobacco during the season .
&quot; we are implementing security measures , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; this is a real cause for concern , and it is not exagg@@ erated to think that people are entitled to rent a piece of fil@@ ter from there .
if the summer has a record le@@ ase , it can do quite a good deal .
but we are using a security team there and 8 par@@ king stations .
let us do our best by using our existing ones .
I will try not to be very concerned about this .
we have a plan in place . &quot;
in the case of Sa@@ du@@ are @-@ I@@ van@@ o@@ va electoral union born to the central party , Kris@@ ti@@ ina O@@ jul@@ and , who was evi@@ cted from the Reform Party , and of Maria Kal@@ j@@ ete , who was forced to leave the ECB , we in Tallinn and the political parties to show the entrepreneurial Association in Tallinn - it would appear that the election unions set up on the initiative of party politics will take part in local elections at least as much as political parties this year .
however , buses will be counted in the autumn , and the key question will be whether there will be enough disappointing voters for all of them .
who will remain on the island ?
if the support office of Ed@@ gar Sa@@ lev@@ are reduced to a small extent , it can anticipate the events organised to honour her electoral union .
one member of the national assembly , a few former and present central parties and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union ?
and why is it that some of the supporters and sis@@ ters of Sa@@ du@@ are evade candida@@ cy in Tallinn , and why is it possible to look for a company &apos;s &apos; Sa@@ du@@ are list &apos; to be turned into a reality ?
in any case , the municipal@@ ity &apos;s cha@@ u@@ vin@@ ist mus@@ ici@@ des film to the Russian po@@ em , in which it participa@@ tes the older city of Las@@ na@@ mä@@ e , and the original computer play in which the prime minister , J@@ ü@@ ri Ra@@ ta , has to avoid l@@ om@@ ni@@ pe and hur@@ ric@@ ans who are on his way when travelling - will the central party , for the first time , seek votes to be allowed to the ballot bo@@ xes by 16 and 17 @-@ year @-@ olds ?
we look forward to seeing other political parties &apos; perception of the youth election campaign .
if the Kan@@ al 2 or T@@ V@@ 3 view@@ ers are confronted with a black h@@ all from the beginning of August , there will be two options : to accept that , in future , only ET@@ V , ET@@ V@@ 2 , ET@@ V + , Tallinn TV and English Fran@@ ce@@ 24 channels or to don@@ ate ten @-@ monthly TV operators .
there are probably also those who openly re@@ jo@@ ice about advertising @-@ free television experience at the beginning , but in the end - albeit reluc@@ tantly - pay for television and advertise@@ ments .
Ac@@ cor@@ ding music , fol@@ ding people and rub@@ b@@ ish left on the streets are un@@ pleasant by almost every major music fil@@ ter .

Washington amends the rules of the Green Card
media publications are quoted by President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i , who says that a new US immigration plan is planned to change the rules of the Green Card .
the plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 people a year , stricter rules on obtaining temporary employment visas and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visas .
the new rules have been proposed by the Re@@ publi@@ can people , and the President supports them .
the bill goes to the two cha@@ mbers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers &apos; money because it will change the way in which green cards are issued to US citizens .
the law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme .
the new application process provides an advantage to candidates who speak English and who have the financial means to support themselves and to have the skills for the benefit of our economy , &quot; said T@@ ru@@ mp , according to media publications in the United States .

J@@ ev@@ se@@ ye@@ v A@@ na@@ tol continues the famous se@@ to gold min@@ ers along the River Ma@@ ana .
she works 140 kilometres away from home to Ma@@ ana tribu@@ taries at Ku@@ vai as a motor driver .
this is a hard job : two months and months after rest , 12 hours of work and then only 10 days at home and again .
during the three years spent in the Ar@@ tel@@ la , A@@ na@@ tol has seen gold only once .
&apos;@@ There is a res@@ ounding procedure : when you go into it , you will check thoroughly that you do not lead to a vi@@ ral , and if you turn out that you don &apos;t take it &apos; , you will talk A@@ na@@ tol .
M@@ are Pi@@ ho spoke in the village of H@@ ai@@ da with the local se@@ to Ja@@ ga , who has spoken a great deal to him about the memory of his family in Si@@ beria .
the archa@@ ic culture still preserved by Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ tos will also have an impact on domestic se@@ als , because it is just so shocking that Pi@@ ho M@@ are , in most detail , believes in remote se@@ tos .
his first investigation trip to Si@@ beria will pass for 30 years this year .
during that time , he has been there 14 times and lived there for one year .
how much was missing out to Si@@ beria at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century to get the land here ?
this is an unresolved issue .
I would argue that 8 000 .
I took note of this in the words of Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ to men , who themselves have thought about it .
it is difficult to say exactly that , because up to 30 people could come to one group at the time , but the passport was only given to a man .
the passport was given only one thing , but was children , sis@@ ters , etc .
look at how great this territory was here .
it was many times greater than that of the his@@ tori@@ an .
after all , it was necessary to educate , manage it in some way .
S@@ et@@ ols came here as farmers , but their lives changed , because here they came to areas that were not only linked to agriculture , but also to rivers ( pal@@ gi@@ par@@ ation ) , gold mines , industry .
for example , in New @-@ Pet@@ ser@@ is , many pigs arrived later on in K@@ ras@@ no@@ jar@@ sk @-@ 45 , where Soviet power built the uranium enrichment plant - J. P@@ . - when it was formed .
did the Sei@@ mas form the majority of the population in this region at that time ?
yes , they lived on a pa@@ tern@@ alistic basis .
in addition , a long tradition continued to mar@@ ry between one another and a lot of child@@ birth .
seven to eight children in the family were common .
how many cultures of Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ to@@ pes diff@@ ered and different from that of mother land ?
they are different , even though what was said here was once the same .
they gave rise to a great many popular ideas .
they then also made a difference ( ideas of peoples ) , but they always made the difference that had been brought about and what had been done here .
climate change has had a major impact on the traditional ri@@ val@@ ry of mix@@ tures , because there is a cold crop here .
the proposed changes have changed .
S@@ et@@ oma@@ al , for example , was s@@ kin@@ ned , but it was simply frozen here .
where are the villages of Si@@ b@@ erian se@@ to@@ pes and what life will live there ? / graph@@ ics : A@@ lar@@ i Pal@@ u@@ ends
the link with the mother country was spiri@@ tually strong , it was regarded as very important .
it seems to me that now this Se@@ tu@@ ony is going to return to it , it will affect them .
those girls who have lived in families have listened to ama@@ zing stories .
Pi@@ ho is thinking of the people of the Estonian delegation , who came to the Kingdom of H@@ ai@@ da at the beginning of July and lived four days in homes - J. P .
what is still here is shocking .
&quot; it is all too easy to come and go , too , because the city has an excellent location : railway hu@@ bs and roads at the crossroads , &quot; says Re@@ ig@@ o Tam@@ m , who comes from T@@ ap@@ y .
the city is no longer just a military capital , we have a great deal of creativity , sports and cultural places , and the bul@@ l gets everywhere .
T@@ ap@@ a is a ti@@ p @-@ po@@ p of the city !
there is a small island along the current White river where the ta@@ ble@@ ts tend to be hi@@ jac@@ ked .
&quot; this beautiful place does not seem to appear on the train window , &quot; don Re@@ ig@@ o .
anyone who is not afraid of cold water will be able to swi@@ m in the river , because the river is full of resources .
I have been sw@@ im@@ ming there ; you can do it !
the river &apos;s water can hold a long time and just do a ro@@ man@@ tics - it can look to the river and think about life and behind it .
I , too , have come to gri@@ ps with my bri@@ lli@@ ants there .
O@@ oper@@ is@@ ol@@ ist Tam@@ m has , apart from anything else , visited the river basin to get used to three bridges : &apos; that place is along the city , no one can come to answer if I say my own stories &apos; .
&quot; there is a wonderful view of the T@@ ap@@ y mountain , but there are also sal@@ ari@@ es where you can drinks , you can ski@@ p a winter , and now , for example , to play a dis@@ gol@@ f game - gol@@ f tra@@ cks have been made , chains can borrow from sports centres . &quot; Re@@ ig@@ o is leading .
of course , the old pro@@ tag@@ onists go there with their system , but I have not yet been able to play there .
obviously , Mrs Ras@@ mus Gol@@ l T@@ ap@@ ale will have to be invited , because she has experienced a dis@@ c@@ gol@@ f game and she has the chains .
perhaps he is lending to me .
Re@@ ig@@ o and M@@ än@@ ni@@ ku@@ ll moun@@ tains were in@@ ex@@ tri@@ c@@ ably in@@ separ@@ able from the current age of self @-@ oper@@ is@@ ism .
at least during hours .
there have been a lot of te@@ ars left for this memory , dis@@ appointments , and rest in my sporting life .
not to mention broken bel@@ ts and s@@ log@@ ans .
&quot; the whole city of the city is now full of construction works , all of which will become unknown , &quot; applau@@ ds Re@@ ig@@ o .
however , the old and ti@@ red stick building is a very attractive place in which oral disco@@ veries are played .
I am pleased that , in 2012 in R@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ M , the leader of R@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ M , welcomed my idea and had to make a summer theat@@ re with his theat@@ re .
even though this year &apos;s theat@@ re entitled &apos; Ale@@ ga@@ i K@@ aren@@ in &apos; has just passed , on 11 August , the railway station &apos; El@@ lu@@ wake &apos; is in the railway station when the old building is moving around in the 1980s .
&quot; between 11 and 13 August , the city of T@@ ap@@ a has Day , which has opened up open doors and clo@@ thes of cultural activities , including a popular t@@ reas@@ ure , will be speaking to Re@@ ig@@ o , who is proposing to visit the city from 9 to 11 days .
the muse@@ um has already been running since 1994 in a tiny three @-@ chamber from 1 May to the pu@@ p@@ pet .
&quot; the house is small , but there is a great deal of publicity , and there is a huge amount of information , &quot; applau@@ ds Re@@ ig@@ o &apos;s place , which is full of the history of the city of T@@ ap@@ a , most of which focuses on railways and sis@@ ters .
Re@@ ig@@ o mu@@ ds that , if you go through all of the recommended sites in T@@ ap@@ al , you will lose a lot of hot air but , fortunately , the small city is full of coff@@ ers .
&quot; we have such good eating places and sometimes , when you sit in ca@@ f@@ és , you sometimes get the feeling that you are abroad , you describe him .
educated and young soldiers coming to T@@ ap@@ y spend a great deal of time in bot@@ tles and ca@@ f@@ és sitting there , a mixed feeling that you are in Estonia and in your home city , but that is the inter@@ lo@@ cu@@ tor together .
I believe it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French people or the Americans .
soldiers , yes , we have a lot to do .
two Bulg@@ arians were arrested in Greece for illegal ten@@ dering
Tele@@ can@@ al b@@ TV quoted a foreign minis@@ tries who reported that two Bulg@@ arians were arrested in Greece for illegal ten@@ dering .
in the morning of 1 August , in the Si@@ th@@ onia Pen@@ insula , the police arrested people who illegally ordered a group , including two Bulg@@ arians .
they were released on the same day , but there is currently an investigation .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said to the TV channel that Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free ten@@ dering and are already imposing heavy fines on all those who do not provide for it .
checks will continue throughout the season .
according to the Ministry of Justice , fines may be imposed .
the w@@ ol@@ ves that teach the people are breaking the sheep .

this year the w@@ ol@@ ves in Hi@@ i@@ u &apos;s coun@@ ty have broken sheep three times , together with 23 sheep , and eight have been injured , signing the Hi@@ i@@ u page .

rules for the management of genetically modified crops must be clear
the Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft law on the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment ( GMOs ) and amending plant protection law .
the amendment of the law remo@@ ves the creation of a separate collection of data for both genetically modified ( GM ) crops and operators , using the plant health register in the future .
in addition , it amends the obligation of the GM crop manager to have prior agreement with the designated person dealing with beekeeping .
although at the moment genetically modified crops are not culti@@ vated in Estonia , we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of GM and non @-@ GM crops .
this is at least as long as there is no decision to declare Estonia GM @-@ free , &quot; S@@ ig@@ mar Suu Kyi , President of the plant health department at the Department of Rural Affairs , said .
&quot; at the same time , it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate , take into account the costs and administrative burdens for both the private and public sectors , in addition . &quot;
the draft law repe@@ als the provisions relating to the collection and management of GM crops in the EU GM crop sites and operators , lays down requirements for the management of GM crops and for the start of economic activities .
specifically with regard to beekeeping , the current obligation to inform bee@@ keepers of the cultivation of GM crops will be replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with bee@@ keepers before starting cultivation .
the draft law has been sent to minis@@ tries for coordination .
all interested parties will have the opportunity to find out about this in the draft information system and , if they so wish , to present their views to the Ministry of Rural Affairs .
the planned changes affect , in particular , those operating in the plant farming sector , bee@@ keepers and the agricultural profession .
in the European Union , including in Estonia , only one GM crop - maize mon 8@@ 10 - has been authorised to grow .
up to now , however , no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing GM crops .
this is due to the fact that in Estonia , there is no ma@@ m@@ mot@@ h , no European media Observatory , on which mon 8@@ 10 lines are resistant .
there are also ord@@ ings of this ma@@ gic line on southern regions , and this in May is not appropriate to our climate conditions .
in order to be secure , in 2015 and 2016 , the Ministry of Rural Affairs ordered studies to detect potential contamination of GM organisms in the seeds of various su@@ ra@@ ms , maize and soya vari@@ eties grown in Estonia .
the analysis of the sam@@ ples carried out showed that seeds were not included externally and that , as a result of the study , the seeds of rape , maize and soya vari@@ eties in Estonia did not include genetically modified organisms .
in turn , one can conclude that in Estonia , GM crops are not deliberately culti@@ vated , and it was also confirmed that there had not been random contamination .

the White House &apos;s audit cost to the taxpayer for thousands
according to military documents made public to the magaz@@ ine , the decision by the White House to fly a naval helicop@@ ter last month for an event to mark American production to a southern hor@@ ror of GBP 24 000 .
the green and white col@@ ours S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D , ter@@ med Marine One during the President &apos;s office , were central to the event in White Ma@@ in on 17 July to show@@ case American construction programmes .
President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp , Vice @-@ President M@@ ike P@@ ence , and senior officials of the White House , unve@@ iled industrial products from all 50 countries during his movement .
a helicop@@ ter built in Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ u@@ tis was spon@@ sored along with a cl@@ one from reputation , a fire @-@ fighting car from W@@ is@@ con@@ ten and a wal@@ ker made in Mis@@ sis@@ si@@ p .
according to reports by Mrs H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter S@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ on One ( H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 ) in charge of the operation of the H@@ eli@@ Cop@@ ter , the H@@ eli@@ Cop@@ ter helicop@@ ter was ordered to have the presence of a helicop@@ ter in the military office of the White House by a little 36 hours before a helicop@@ ter for a &apos; unusual &apos; event on the southern hor@@ ror .
&quot; I wanted you to be aware of this , because it is an un@@ usually high @-@ profile event , &quot; said H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 kom@@ comm@@ and@@ ö@@ r a day before the event , in an e @-@ mail , to your top naval officer in the field of aviation .
the message stated that the helicop@@ ter would arrive at the southern hor@@ ror on 17 July morning at 7 : 00 &apos;@@ clock , and will remain there until the same night between 18 and 21 : 00 .
it was included that , if the departure from the White House were to be present , there would be a need for a return flight due to restrictions on working time , for a second a@@ gi@@ tation .
the original flight team was at helicop@@ ter during the event , and the security team of the es@@ tu@@ r remained close to the aircraft throughout this period of stay on the ground .
it was not possible to read out from the documents provided by the magaz@@ ine whether or not a second a@@ mus@@ ement was ultimately needed .
the H@@ at@@ ch law prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political ends .
the documents show that H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 investigated whether this event could violate this provision .
&quot; we asked whether it was in breach of H@@ at@@ ch &apos;s law and we were told that there would not be a breach , &quot; the com@@ man@@ der wrote .
&apos;@@ It seems that you have no choice , &apos; responded to a senior officer .
the White House declared the &apos; American @-@ made &apos; event to be an official event , and H@@ at@@ ch &apos;s law would not have covered it .
however , even official events have political under@@ ton@@ es .
at that time , the President backed the efforts of health reform during the Senate and praised attempts to keep government regulations in check .
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force for political gain is not a new phenomenon .
Presidents must use them to travel .
however , the requirement to use them purely photo@@ graphic is unusual .
in February , the T@@ ru@@ mp came to the attention when , at his first campaign event in Flor@@ idas Mel@@ bour@@ ne , the President &apos;s flight was on the water background , and on Twitter &apos;s account k@@ ic@@ ks off messages complaining about the way in which his predecessor used his flight .
&apos;@@ White l Ma@@ l is very pleased with the exhibition &apos; made in America , where products were represented in all 50 countries made up of American workers from American materials , &apos; said Vice @-@ President L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters , the spokes@@ man of the White House .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 teams often carry tests around Washington and the southern hor@@ ror in order to be@@ at the white house of the President of the United States with a single cent of prec@@ ision .
when the T@@ ru@@ mp was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , the H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 White House organised 58 sam@@ ples .
according to the interpre@@ ter , flights to the &apos; American @-@ made &apos; flight cre@@ ws were considered to be the norm for a month of study flights .
Es@@ ka@@ ad@@ r helicop@@ ter was flying another 11 hours &apos; for non @-@ President support missions on that day .
according to the White House , none of the other spon@@ sors of this event were cutting the taxpayers &apos; w@@ alle@@ ts .
according to S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky &apos;s representative , a helicop@@ ter on the southern hor@@ ror was not involved in carrying out fil@@ tering .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 does not maintain the budgetary documents of President flights and it is difficult to find out the exact costs of the event .
however , according to h@@ our@@ ly prices by the Ministry of Defence for the financial year 2017 , V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D will be reimbursed at USD 24 380 per hour .
the Es@@ ka@@ ad@@ r &apos;s documents indicated a flight extension of its main base , from e Qu@@ an@@ tic@@ o airport to Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , to 30 minutes in both directions .
the White House claims that the actual cost of using the helicop@@ ter is well below that amount .
&quot; it is very misleading to calculate taxpayers &apos; expenditure on the basis of estimated reimbursement rates , &quot; said Wal@@ ters .
&quot; these estimated reimbursement rates include staff , maintenance and many other irre@@ vo@@ cable expenditure , which will be taken into account for annual appropriations . &quot;
according to a study carried out in 2015 , the Ministry of Defence does not include staff costs , although they cover costs related to fuel , maintenance and contracts .
the former press officer of the White House , Se@@ an S@@ hari@@ er , defended the use of helicop@@ ter at the time at the event .
&quot; the point is to show things made in America this week , &quot; said S@@ stop@@ er .
&quot; and I know that the State of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ u@@ ti is very proud that they contribute to our national security and that there are supposedly hundreds , if not even thousands , of people whose work depends on it .
and I believe that just like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicop@@ ter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked ti@@ rele@@ ssly on .
so of course it is right to highlight this . &quot;
it is not clear whether or not the T@@ ru@@ mp tied a helicop@@ ter in the southern hor@@ ror as part of the event , and whether or not , the fire @-@ fighting car was hiding behind the whe@@ el .
within the White House , T@@ ru@@ mp S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky addressed representatives by hand@@ ing out media ou@@ tle@@ ts about company products in his personal aircraft fleet .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ skis very well , &quot; said the President , &apos; I have three of their products &apos; .

worse still lies ahead : a month later , his Olympic contest in Ri@@ os on account of his resigna@@ tion was already covered by the first obstacle .
the time had to be taken down - was there any continuation of the 7 competition ?
is the two @-@ day effort still worth all this ?
N@@ ei@@ u thought for a long time , but found peace .
I had to think twice !
it is relatively difficult to describe this experience , but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen .
T@@ han@@ k@@ fully , there was time for us to treat ourselves as a whole and to think twice .
&quot; I knew that I did not put a co@@ ck@@ ta@@ g on the pil@@ l , &quot; Š@@ ade@@ ik@@ o talks about his self @-@ cle@@ ans@@ ing .
I was able to turn a clean page and move ahead with a new momentum .

one alcohol whose drinking is equivalent to &apos; training &apos; .
Li@@ ves@@ tr@@ ong wri@@ tes that Dr Gordon She@@ per@@ d is an e@@ lep@@ h@@ ant of so great wine games that he believes that wine can teach the brain better than any other thing in the world .
She@@ per@@ d is a neuro@@ scien@@ tist of Y@@ ale University .
his message is not about alcohol , or about how it affects our feelings and ideas , but about the &apos; very active &apos; wine flavourings process .
when we s@@ le@@ ep , wine was complicated by ta@@ iling , enjoying it and perceived the after@@ taste , we are putting our brain in order to create a taste for wine .
in the words of She@@ per@@ d , there is no real taste in the bo@@ xes , but a taste of taste arises from the way wine stimu@@ lates the brain .
he points out how the brain &apos; sees &apos; col@@ ours &apos; .
&quot; taste is not wine ; taste creates wine as swe@@ et , &quot; says She@@ per@@ d .
things that still affect the taste of wine are , for example , the number of our age , summer and even sy@@ l@@ je produced by man .
She@@ per@@ d , of course , ad@@ mits that wine is not full of Jews .
&apos;@@ There must be more &apos; , he says .
if you take too big a lon@@ ger , the system will be over@@ loaded .
excess wine drinking can do no harm to the brain instead of benefits : according to a study in 2004 , people who drink more than three pieces of wine , memory loss , loss of balance and reduced mental capacity are at risk .

despite the fact that the kil@@ ler of P@@ ab@@ lo Es@@ co@@ b@@ ari was exposed in the second season of the &apos; Nar@@ co@@ s &apos; , Net@@ f@@ li@@ x s@@ ari is far from finished .
the third and fourth season has been valida@@ ted by the quota intervention service , and the first one has already been produced by a cli@@ p of advertising that is stran@@ g@@ le@@ hold the hor@@ ns with new sca@@ ms .
in the third season , D@@ EA will turn its attention to the rich@@ est drug business organisation in the world - the C@@ ali car@@ tel .
they are acting under the leadership of four powerful Christian fathers , such as Ford 500 companies , simply with more bri@@ ber@@ y to the government and more violent acts .

according to the UN , Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics .
the head of the UN mission for Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections can only represent the people if all members of society , including women , play a role in them .
Nic@@ ho@@ las Ha@@ y@@ so@@ m , head of the United Nations Assistance Mission , said that hundreds of women stand in local Soviet elections , three women stand as Vice @-@ President and more than 30 % of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; by underlining the importance of the role of women , it is not possible to ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ate , &quot; he said in a statement made on Wednesday .
the elections can truly represent the people and only be credible if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process .
the local council elections in Afghanistan and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April .
for its part , the Taliban have threatened the electoral process , which coinci@@ des with the transitional period in which the role of international military operations becomes advisory .
this year &apos;s elections mark the first time that power is given cal@@ mly by one democratically elected government to the next .
according to Mr Ha@@ ys@@ om , women &apos;s strong role in the success of democracy in Afghanistan increases .
according to an independent Ele@@ ction Commission in Afghanistan , 1.2 million women have registered from 3.@@ 6 million registered voters .
the joy of sharing makes every thing more acute , both for large and small .
there is always too little common time , but the trend is a good opportunity to combine meetings , games , proximity and burdens .
and what a convenient solution - no matter where you went in the summer , live animals are always on the ver@@ ge , and I am anxious to recall with your fine voice : &apos; let us now also be tr@@ usted &apos; .
A@@ el@@ ta insu@@ lation - It is a very good thing to play a normal gold game , or to by@@ pass the flag of the coast@@ line .

it is wonderful to use children instead of a chic@@ ken !
first of all , it is secure and convenient , and the difficulty is gradually increasing at the same pace as the forces of train@@ ers .
it will also be possible to take bat@@ teries with quite a large number of children .
the child teac@@ hes a balance , counts sentences and feels the opportunity to be high and important .
larger children may , at the same time , make their own villages .
the scope of the movement lies in the scarcity of the land and in the cle@@ ans@@ ing of hands .
keeping the fin@@ gers straight , the Pal@@ u mini@@ ab@@ lis properly .
a child can read cor@@ ps and feel like a le@@ c@@ ture@@ r .

however , it is easy to do it .
play @-@ plan@@ k : go to a long plan@@ gu@@ Col@@ on@@ n that is repeated .
in fact , it is more difficult than usual , but much easier to do if , in the meantime , a friend can hand his hand .
if you add the burden , you can keep a plan@@ ade , you can keep a little on the market , and you can walk around it .
an additional difficulty can be made to sit on the hip of a child , but this exercise offers a break for all children .
while the cra@@ bs join the sand , the ro@@ ck , the ash and the can@@ e meat burden , such as the infection , will become tri@@ gg@@ ers .
the child wal@@ ks to the sho@@ es in such a way that his body is distributed on an equal footing .
for security , you can keep your hands closed .

O@@ tt ( 10 ) , S@@ ä@@ de ( 8 ) , happ@@ iness ( 4 ) were the sources of sport .

B@@ oo@@ ked bags are the summer clas@@ h , which in recent years has become one piece of h@@ it@@ iner@@ ant which , even on the one hand , has had to han@@ g at the top of the hand and to which traders , regardless of its modest origin , have been able to display a price label according to h@@ aste .
there is probably one such thing that has existed once in the life of the law and which has not been aro@@ used much emo@@ tion .
it simply exists and , if it does not exist , there will be nothing at all .
now , however , l@@ ung@@ s are entering a real race , and mo@@ pe@@ ds have swit@@ ched their mus@@ h@@ oles against simple bureaucra@@ ts by the summer months .
it is not only a coast@@ line , but today it is also just as popular as a street , and b@@ older women are kno@@ cking it even into the office .
at this point , however , it is worth making it clear whether you are still sitting here in the summer , or whether it is worth postponing a sign and lap@@ top@@ s to a little more official .
however , women &apos;s real love of summer has been given by bre@@ w@@ ers .
for example , if you look at foreign mos@@ ques , the first thing is that mo@@ e@@ o@@ gh@@ ur@@ ists will first bring their holidays to the local market and buy some be@@ er bags , which are then the tru@@ ck of a whole holiday period and which go hand in hand in hand , in the market , and also as a friend on the city .
some blo@@ gg@@ ers are so generous that they are buying bags on the market , selling more w@@ ol@@ ves and selling them or giving them away to their loyal read@@ ers .
in doing so , it is worth pointing out that there is a demand among read@@ ers so great that women ( and men ! ) in the real world would probably be involved in each other &apos;s fishing ground in order to obtain the happy owners of some do@@ gs .
in some ways , this mad@@ ness is also understandable , because the rare are the times when , in fashi@@ on@@ ism yesterday , it has been possible to buy a couple of pieces of h@@ aste for just a few decades .
it is true that white merchan@@ ts have also discovered a simple way of ear@@ ning money here , and in so doing more luxury br@@ ands also sell bags for a few hundred days and -@@ a thousand euros .
obviously , in order for rich customers not to have to feel easy to die by pro@@ pel@@ ling with some cheap do@@ gs .
it is possible , for example , to buy D@@ ol@@ ce &amp; Gab@@ ban@@ a hand over EUR 1 000 .
however , a Chan@@ gel bre@@ g@@ ko@@ t &apos;s interpretation can be found in the EUR 6 000 circulation chain .
in contrast to most mo@@ tive buildings , however , l@@ ot@@ teries do not inher@@ it at all with a few great mos@@ ques , but their story origin@@ ated in a far more distant way .
it is said that it is far removed from the Philippines , where they have been we@@ aring them wide .
there is , first and foremost , an export business , and there is very often no mention of local dumping .
Ad@@ mittedly , it is the 14@@ th century of an a@@ mus@@ ement technique , and it is quite a series of normal cor@@ ps .
however , since the be@@ er does not have to bun@@ dle as much red as cor@@ ps , they become mus@@ cles and other materials that make it more person@@ alised and , by extension , more reac@@ tive .
in recent times , for example , there are particularly tr@@ end@@ y do@@ gs , where pa@@ ints or s@@ kin@@ s have been packa@@ ged .
however , cop@@ ies can , above all , be sent by ac@@ tress leader , J@@ ane Bir@@ kin@@ i , the biggest bun@@ dled be@@ er of whom had not been seen before .
in particular , he su@@ ed a l@@ ot@@ tery with all sorts of clothing pac@@ ks and did not even have to go to the Cannes Film F@@ esti@@ val a lot .
nowadays , however , the popul@@ arity of the applicants does not play a smaller role , either , because caring for them is a hot head and , unlike any other summer produc@@ tions , it does not have to care for them by means of special funds , but it also depri@@ ves the water and the w@@ et .
as is still the case in the case of tr@@ end@@ ant rob@@ b@@ ers , apart from classi@@ cal stra@@ its , br@@ ands have come out with all possible interpretations .
for example , if they want to be able to obtain a bun@@ ch of be@@ ers , you can have a bot@@ tle or a tiny boo@@ m .
at the same time , it is worth remembering that the classi@@ cal be@@ er will never come from a mos@@ que , but from be@@ er flu .
but what is the classi@@ cal be@@ er , then ?
for centuries now , a bun@@ ch of be@@ ers has been clas@@ sed to rese@@ mble repetition of its style has been opened up , and it is short , as well as be@@ ers , cri@@ pp@@ les .

G@@ M@@ B is concerned about investments in the Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;@@ s G@@ las@@ go@@ w plant
the company expects the managers of the mature producer and Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e to confirm long @-@ term production plans at the company &apos;s G@@ las@@ go@@ w plant .
according to G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ land , the company has remained silent on the subject of the future of the investment .
more than 500 people are employed in the case of H@@ ob@@ no@@ b@@ si and the rich know @-@ how and other products .
Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s owner , Pla@@ s , said that they had invested more than GBP 5 million over the last few years .
there have been workers and trade union chair@@ men &apos; who hear the first &apos; when something changes change in the operation of the factory .
in a letter sent to the manager of the company , G@@ M@@ B Scotland , Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e , addressed a request to &apos; alla@@ y concerns about the lack of funding to modernise production lines &apos; .
G@@ M@@ B senior organis@@ er D@@ re@@ w Du@@ ff@@ y said : &apos; the fact that we do not get clarity from the chief manager of the object on the customs / VIS business needs and the future investment plan makes our members deeply concerned .
several generations of families have worked here , and the labour force is largely made up of the local community and people around G@@ las@@ go@@ w , an essential pillar for ensuring proper employment in an area where there is high unemployment and social housing .
therefore , in terms of jobs , wages and well @-@ being in the East of G@@ las@@ go@@ w and Bre@@ x@@ ti , in the context of a steady drop in living costs and production , a thri@@ ving production company in Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e needs to grow . &quot;
the Pla@@ dis@@ e representative said : &apos; at the time , he received a letter from G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ t only yesterday , and the company responds directly to him because we value active engagement with workers and trade union representatives .
two months ago , there was a regular meeting between the workers in Rab@@ at and the representatives of the G@@ M@@ B , which openly discussed a number of issues .
we then discussed with the workers that , like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we would review our activities now - and this applies to all of our businesses and objects - in order to ensure our competitiveness .
he added : &apos; in recent years , we have invested over GBP 5 million on the site of Customs , most of which have gone to production lines and improvements in procedures .
we fully understand the heritage of customs as a source of production , and if there should be any changes in the activities of the object , workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it . &quot;
did the PS@@ G warn Barcelona three years ago for its approach to Ney@@ ra ?
la li regrets its interest in Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti .
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not give up in its efforts to attract Ney@@ mar in its ranks by offering an offer of GBP 18@@ 9 million to cover it , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago for its record inaugu@@ ration ?
this bold approach has opened summer as a transitional window , and L@@ ig@@ ue 1 club is ready to dem@@ ol@@ ish more than two times the current world record , which was set in the previous season by returning Paul Po@@ g@@ ba back to Manch@@ ester Uni@@ te@@ tle for GBP 89 million .
once the swit@@ ch@@ over has been completed , Ney@@ ra will , as a result , become the most expensive player in the world , and also the highest paid professional spor@@ ts@@ man in the world who will be paid more than GBP 500 000 a week after payment from the PS@@ G .
Barcelona is , of course , ang@@ ry , not only because of the approach , but also because of the breaking down of Ney@@ ra , even though a source close to the leadership of Ca@@ tal@@ ans@@ i confirms that the club has always taken the best care for football since its arrival in San@@ ps in 2013 .
however , did the PS@@ G President warn the football world about such an opportunity three years ago ?
when Manch@@ ester City showed an interest in the conclusion of the Blair Ma@@ tu@@ tis Agreement in 2014 , the N@@ asse@@ r Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f strongly warned all clubs who think about recru@@ iting some of the PS@@ G &apos;s best players .
&quot; I am not worried because they know that , when they are concerned about some of our players , we will accept them and contact them , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
however , if they try to conclude an agreement with some of our players , they will have to face the consequences . &quot;
Barcelona appears to have moved beyond this limit , as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed interest in the PS@@ G central player , Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti .
the PS@@ G made it clear that they would not be allowed to leave the field under any circumstances , and that Barcelona could become a set@@ back as a result of this interest by abolishing one of its precious assets in the form of Ney@@ ra .
Prime Minister : Ireland wants to build bridges and not borders after Bre@@ x@@ iti@@ t .
&quot; Bre@@ x@@ it is in serious danger of breaking the w@@ ool between Northern Ireland and Ireland , Great Britain and Ireland , &quot; warned Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r during his first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June .
&quot; I cannot imagine who would benefit from it , &quot; he added .
cross @-@ border infrastructure projects made it possible for the current free movement of people and goods , said Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r .
&quot; this is our vision for the future : building bridges , not borders , &quot; she stressed .
she would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union and , as this cannot be achieved , to remain part of the European single market .
it would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom .
another way to make Britain &apos;s departure smoo@@ ther would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the UK , explained by the Irish Prime Minister .
noting that there was such an agreement with Turkey , Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r said : &apos; surely we could have this with Britain . &apos;
the alternative to this would be a return to customs points , which would declare historical division and political failure .
&apos;@@ Bu@@ il@@ ding trade , prosperity and peace &apos; said the Prime Minister of Ireland .
he called Bre@@ x@@ iti@@ t &apos; our generation challenge &apos; and warned that the result could affect every aspect of everyday life in Northern Ireland .
the Irish Prime Minister met the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland when visiting Bel@@ fast .
the first half @-@ long tri@@ ath@@ on note of Av@@ ril : I@@ ron@@ man will be able to pass through everyone .
today , in the winter capital , O@@ te@@ save l Bal@@ ti@@ er , the biggest tri@@ ath@@ l@@ ors took place when nearly a thousand tri@@ ath@@ le@@ tes from more than three out of ten countries took part in qu@@ asi @-@ I@@ ron@@ man competition .
7@@ 0.@@ 3 miles of enter@@ tainment consis@@ ted of 1.9 km flooding , 90 km of cy@@ cling and 2@@ 1.1 km of cy@@ cling .
among other things , the first tri@@ ath@@ on of her life won a victory .
&quot; I thought it would prove difficult and , in the end , difficult . &quot;
in spite of the complexity , Av@@ ril said that the tri@@ ath@@ on is , in fact , affordable for almost everyone .
&apos;@@ It is not the dance that kills the pace &apos; , it says , suggesting that , at a comfortable pace , almost everyone will reach the finishing line .
with the exception of O@@ tt Se@@ pp , &apos; It is OK , but unfortunately it cannot swi@@ m &apos; .
Av@@ ril had already taken a keen lead since February .
at the beginning , 4 @-@ 5 hours a week , later ten hours a week .
time 05 : 34 : 12 achieved 27@@ 60 in overall terms .
although Av@@ and lost both R@@ ai@@ o Pi@@ accused ( time 04 : 59 : 53 : 53 ) and J@@ ür@@ gen L@@ ig@@ ale ( time 05 : 06 : 37 ) , she won other competing champi@@ ons in the so @-@ called &apos; prominent class &apos; .
last year , Tan@@ el Pa@@ da@@ r , a good example , lost A@@ van@@ le in seven minutes ( time : 05 : 41 : 54 ) , journalist S@@ ten Te@@ pp@@ an in 16 minutes ( time 05 : 50 : 23 ) , Kal@@ e@@ v K@@ r@@ new and Ra@@ iv@@ o E. Tam@@ m for nearly an hour ( times : 31 : 53 and 06 : 45 : 18 : 18 ) .
I@@ ron@@ man in O@@ te@@ pä@@ ä , a general winner of the ranking of men belonging to O@@ te@@ pä@@ ä , was chron@@ ically given by Germany , Johannes Mol@@ dan , with effect 3 : 58 : 27 : 27 , Est@@ oni@@ ans were the best I@@ vo plen@@ r in 04 : 14 : 09 .
among women , the Danish woman , Hel@@ le Fre@@ der@@ ik@@ sen , won 04 : 24 : 01 : 01 , Est@@ oni@@ ans , Maria J@@ än@@ ese , who lost nearly half a hour to Fre@@ der@@ ik@@ sen and obtained 04 : 58 : 58 .
Av@@ ja went through 1.9 km of sw@@ im@@ ming with 42 minutes and 14 seconds .
she came out in 4@@ 10 positions .
