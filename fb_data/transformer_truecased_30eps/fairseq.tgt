four members of the K@@ ro@@ Cape Verde group were detained in Estonia and Spain
according to postal he , in Spain , the so @-@ called K@@ Cape ro Group leader , S@@ Crisis Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ ch , known as the S@@ Ã´@@ ne K@@ Cape ro@@ v@@ ski , was detained by the police in the Italian alliance .
Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ ch , who was detained in Spain , was arrested in court .
yesterday , the Court also arrested three suspects in Estonia .
it is suspected that it is members of the so @-@ called K@@ Cape Verde criminal association aged between 27 and 57 , who commit mainly drug crimes .
in the province of M@@ ala , Spain , the alleged head of the criminal association was detained .
in Estonia , three men were arrested as suspects , one of whom is the leading figure of the criminal association , according to the data collected , and two are members of the criminal organisation .
the data collected indicate that the criminal community had a clear division of roles and tasks .
the objective of the criminal community &apos;s actions was to commit drug crimes and thereby generate criminal proceeds , &quot; commented on the head of the pre @-@ trial proceedings in criminal cases , Public Prosecutor Va@@ revolu@@ Ver@@ te .
&apos;@@ We do not rule out that there is an increase in the circle of suspects of this criminal offence &apos; .
these are people who have previously been interested in law enforcement , and some of them have been punished for drug crimes .
Ver@@ te stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been essential throughout the investigation .
&quot; international cooperation has become common@@ place for us and this week &apos;s operation shows the success of cooperation , &quot; commented Ver@@ te .
the leader of the central criminal police service , Mr Le@@ is , said that detention was preceded by a preliminary investigation lasting nearly one and a half years .
&quot; in the first half of the week , long @-@ lasting work was realised and we were simultaneously detained in Estonia and Spain for suspected crimes . &quot;
Le@@ is added that central criminal police officers helped to arrest in Spain .
for years we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard .
these de@@ ten@@ tions are another message to criminals that we will also get them from the other end of Europe , &quot; said Le@@ is .
the information gathered so far clearly indicates that suspected men can continue to commit new crimes when they are in freedom , which is why the prosecution service requested and approved by the Court .
in Spain , a man arrested is waiting for him to be handed over to Estonia .
under this criminal case , properties , vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure confiscation .
the criminal case is pre @-@ trial by the Central Criminal Police Office of organised crime and is led by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office .
the City Court of Tallinn in 2005 sentenced S@@ Crisis Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ ch to blackmail and punished him with a five @-@ year prison sentence .
in the middle of last decade , Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ ch was considered the second most important child in the world , following the then alliance , Niko@@ lai T@@ aran@@ ko@@ v .
Gu@@ le@@ vit@@ ch from Cape Verde came to the source of Estonia in the early 1990s , when he started to deal with blackmail in Tallinn .
he allegedly charged tax@@ i tax@@ i and prostitution on various hotel boards and demanded monthly ro@@ of tax from busines@@ spe@@ ople .
international joint operations , confiscation of proceeds of crime and court decisions which have entered into force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective .
for example , the latest sentences , the eight accused of the so @-@ called D@@ ik@@ hs criminal offence , who were confis@@ cated with a criminal income of EUR 80 000 , or the verdict against nine individuals that Ig@@ or Ale@@ y@@ ni@@ ko@@ v created a criminal association in 2006 aimed at the illegal trade in illegal cigarettes and the crimes of human trafficking in human beings in the countries of the East Vir@@ u@@ ya and southern Estonia .
the proceeds of crime confis@@ cated there amount to almost EUR 71 500 .
progress has been made in these criminal matters by police officers exchanging information and prosecutors on a daily basis , and , if necessary , by acting together in any European Union country .
citizens &apos; rights group war@@ ns Mis@@ sou@@ sou@@ sou@@ res about travel
the National Association for the Ad@@ van@@ SS@@ of C@@ olo@@ red People ( NA@@ MA ) has warned the black people travelling to Mis@@ sou@@ ris@@ se of a discriminatory policy and racist attack by the State .
the group statement reads : &apos; the NA@@ MA travel barrier issued per Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i State , valid until 28 August 2017 , calls on all African travellers , visitors and so sou@@ ri@@ ans to be particularly attentive and extremely cautious as they move around the state , given the whole range of suspi@@ cious racial events that have taken place recently and have been pointed out here . &apos;
according to NA@@ ACP , the group was urged to issue a travel warning both recently in the Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i Act , which makes it more difficult to obtain cases of discrimination , and in the fact that the targets for state law enforcement are objectively targeted by minorities in large measure .
&quot; people &apos;s rights are being violated .
they are drawn down because of their sk@@ in colour , beaten or killed , &apos; said the President of NA@@ AC Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i , R@@ od Cha@@ pel magaz@@ ine The K@@ ans@@ as City Sta@@ r .
&apos;@@ We have never compla@@ ined so closely before &apos; .
this is the first such warning that has been issued by an organisation for a US state .
the group referred to events such as racist insul@@ ts against black students at Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i University and the death of S@@ and@@ er@@ si , a 28 @-@ year @-@ old black story from T@@ en@@ nes@@ ta .
S@@ and@@ ers died at the beginning of this year under dubious circumstances after having ran out of petrol from the state and without being charged with a crime by the Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i police .
in addition , a note refers to a recent report prepared by the Chief Prosecutor of Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i , which shows that in the State , the cars of black drivers are being stopped 75 % more likely than those of white men .
&apos;@@ The comment is intended to make people aware and to warn their families , friends and collabor@@ ators about what could happen in Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is &apos; said Cha@@ pel .
&quot; people need to be ready , whether it means taking money away or informing their relatives that they are passing through the state . &quot;
based on the latest information from F@@ B@@ I &apos;s hate crime programme , 100 hate crime crimes were recorded in Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i in 2015 , which places the State in the 16@@ th place of cross @-@ section of the country in the same number of cases .
the travel warning is also a response to the new Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i law , which makes it difficult to take a company to court for reasons of discrimination in search of housing or work .
the American Civil Liberties Association ( EB@@ AC@@ L@@ U ) had previously issued travel no@@ tions about T@@ ex@@ as and Ari@@ z@@ ona , following the adoption of the Immigration Regulations by these States , which obliged the local authorities to arrest people for immigration offences , because ACTA L@@ U said that this would increase racial profiling .
usually , travel warnings are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs against other countries , but recently , interest groups have started to use this measure as a counter @-@ reaction to certain US laws and trends .
he@@ pati@@ tis : what would everyone know about the different forms of this serious disease ?
He@@ pati@@ tis , or li@@ ver bur@@ ns , may be caused by five he@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses of A , B , C , D and E .
all these vir@@ uses highlight the acute inc@@ iner@@ ator of li@@ ver .
however , the cost of mal@@ ici@@ ous expenditure is chronic he@@ pati@@ tis B and C , which can continue to develop into a li@@ ver cir@@ r@@ ho@@ ea , that is to say , a li@@ ver cor@@ al and li@@ ver cancer .
the epidemi@@ ological Ad@@ vis@@ er of the Health Agency , Ku@@ ul@@ o Ku@@ tsa@@ r , says that the acute he@@ pati@@ tis disease phenomenon is the same for all types of li@@ ver inc@@ iner@@ ator : f@@ ever , fa@@ ti@@ vis@@ m , swe@@ et , sp@@ ice , bar@@ rage , ox@@ y@@ sti@@ fication , c@@ ala@@ mity , mal@@ activity , meat and excessive disease , and sk@@ in and mass sc@@ ars .
the last disease also comes from the popular name of li@@ ver inc@@ iner@@ ator three diseases .
children may experience he@@ pati@@ tis without any disease .
it is possible to determine the various types of land bur@@ ned exclusively on the basis of laboratory data .
deep he@@ pati@@ tis can go over chronic he@@ pati@@ tis and go on for decades without disease , meaning that you may not know anything about your dangerous condition , which damages your pay .
Mr Ku@@ tsa@@ r sets out the various forms of he@@ pati@@ tis and describes their progress closely .
he@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses of a he@@ pati@@ tis are spreading from an ill to a person and infected us when eating contaminated food or drinking water , se@@ x@@ ony , infected person &apos;s emissions from stran@@ g@@ le@@ dge , be@@ ds , objects , wal@@ king into contact and drinking drugs .
this he@@ pati@@ tis @-@ transmitted infection was caused by family members and carers of the disease , people suffering from chronic li@@ ver diseases , sex people infected with infection , men , drug users , passengers visiting countries with A he@@ pati@@ tis tis .
it is possible to prevent infection by vacc@@ inations , in particular by recommending vaccination for people who travel a lot and who are at risk of he@@ pati@@ tis A .
furthermore , it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements : to was@@ h or dis@@ infec@@ t hands before consuming food to was@@ h all fruit and vegetables .
the he@@ pati@@ tis virus is spreading in contact with human blood , drugs injec@@ tion , pregnancy , honour , blood @-@ contaminated me@@ ad@@ o@@ ws ( den@@ tists , pregnan@@ cies ) , blood blood @-@ blood disease , sex with he@@ pati@@ tis @-@ har@@ b@@ ing@@ er and he@@ pati@@ tis @-@ patient crea@@ tions / inf@@ ants .
the risk group on he@@ pati@@ tis contamination includes injec@@ ting drug users , sex partners of infected human beings , sex men with men , survi@@ v@@ ors of infected mother , family members and carers , blood and other body flu@@ ids , health care , rescue workers and police officers , and passengers visiting countries with a high incidence of he@@ pati@@ tis B .
to prevent he@@ pati@@ tis tis tis , it is possible to vacc@@ in@@ ate people ; in particular , it is recommended to vacc@@ in@@ ate people at risk , as well as persons suffering from chronic li@@ ver diseases , HIV infections , sexu@@ ally transmitted diseases and diabe@@ tes .
the he@@ pati@@ tis in other preventive measures is : avoiding the use of alien hygiene and man@@ ure tools , other th@@ era@@ pe@@ u@@ tic tools and need@@ les , gro@@ oming and au@@ tism , and using con@@ d@@ oms in the event of a dangerous mix@@ ture of infection or preventing sexual exposure .
anti @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis B vaccination is part of the national immun@@ isation scheme in Estonia and is free of charge for children .
He@@ pati@@ tis C vir@@ uses spread to human blood , drugs injec@@ tion , pregnancy , honour , blood @-@ contaminated me@@ ad@@ o@@ ws , donors &apos; blood , sexual treatment of a he@@ pati@@ tis drug and he@@ pati@@ tis disease to fo@@ e@@ der crea@@ tions / inf@@ ants .
He@@ pati@@ tis C @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis drug addi@@ cts , sex partners of infected human beings , sex men , survi@@ v@@ ors of infected mother , family members and carers , blood and other body flu@@ ids are exposed to health care , rescue workers and police officers , persons with HIV infection and passengers visiting countries with he@@ pati@@ tis C .
He@@ pati@@ tis C is a preventive measure : avoiding the use of alien hygiene and man@@ ure tools , other th@@ era@@ pe@@ u@@ tic tools and sy@@ stal@@ des @-@ need@@ les , fu@@ n and au@@ tism and con@@ d@@ oms in the event of a dangerous mix@@ ture of infection .
there is no he@@ pati@@ tis C vaccine .
He@@ pati@@ tis tis is caused by the he@@ pati@@ tis D virus , which occurs in the presence of the he@@ pati@@ tis B virus .
consequently , there are D he@@ pati@@ tis B infections , together with he@@ pati@@ tis B or super@@ infection in chronic B he@@ pati@@ tis disease .
He@@ pati@@ tis vir@@ uses spread through contact with blood and other body flu@@ ids , contaminated need@@ les , sexu@@ ally transmitted and inf@@ requ@@ ently infected animals .
the He@@ pati@@ tis he@@ pati@@ tis risk group is chronic B he@@ pati@@ tis vi@@ ral officers and people not with he@@ pati@@ tis B immun@@ e .
an effective preventive measure is vaccination B with he@@ pati@@ tis vaccine , which also protects people from exposure to the he@@ pati@@ tis D virus .
the he@@ pati@@ tis virus is spreading fe@@ minis@@ tic along the or@@ ch@@ es@@ tra of drinking water and food , including low @-@ bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re beef , fish and sea sh@@ ell@@ fish , donors with blood , joint need@@ les and more infected fo@@ et@@ uses .
passengers may be infected by he@@ pati@@ tis @-@ he@@ pati@@ tis in countries with disease .
He@@ pati@@ tis prevention measures include compliance with hygiene requirements : was@@ hing or dis@@ infec@@ ting hands after entry , before c@@ oo@@ king and eating , after sick care .
F@@ ru@@ its and vegetables will was@@ h before consumption , avoid eating little heat @-@ treated beef , fish and se@@ af@@ ood , drink only safe drinking water and refrain from consuming drugs .
although over the last round , the four @-@ fold Olympic winners were trying to get away from the race , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old F@@ ara@@ h ended up in power and won over time 2@@ 6.@@ 4@@ 9.@@ 51 .
F@@ ara@@ h did not think long ago , leaving the hus@@ band of T@@ ania and children on his way after his fin@@ i@@ ff .
this was a special moment for me .
I very much love my family .
being on the path with them was wonderful , &quot; said F@@ ara@@ h for journalists .
F@@ ara@@ h will target the 5@@ 5,000 and 10@@ ,000 @-@ me@@ tre race in London for the fifth edition .
everything is possible , if it is believed .
despite the title , Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;@@ Con@@ nor@@ i died much deeper from the birth of the 19th century and from the early 20th century in Vienna .
but more deeply in history .
perhaps the lou@@ der &apos;s information level could have gone off , the narro@@ w@@ ly subject of which would have had more influence on the extraordinary story of the portfolio ree allowed in the head@@ lines .
for the time being , some of these gu@@ es@@ ts would be like two books : G@@ ood Kli@@ m@@ t and his land , the story of A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri , and a much greater and more comprehensive history book from the respected Jewish families and the German occupation , with its subsequent effects in Austria .
the first third of the book is leading to a thri@@ ving cultural life in Vienna in the middle , and who itself came to the capital of Austria , can even imagine how more than a hundred years ago life went around R@@ ing@@ st@@ race or how the Cen@@ tr@@ ali coff@@ ee swe@@ pt all its head when the climate entered .
the concentration of cultural figures was in one of Europe &apos;s rich@@ est cities and , seeing the name in the book familiar with it , they felt like a gram more cul@@ turally .
however , for example , the fact that S@@ ig@@ mun@@ d Fre@@ ud acted in a town in which there was an un@@ treated ar@@ son , and where Europe was the highest level of suicide , creates nothing more for development .
perhaps , however , every couple of honest pa@@ ints also add colour to the cultural life in Vienna at the start of the 20th century .
dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
in the last few decades of the 19th century , the number of Jews in Vienna had explo@@ ded , becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe .
almost 1 in 10 people in Vienna were in S@@ aj@@ an@@ di@@ di@@ ment .
the parents of A@@ rad were also new@@ com@@ ers in Vienna , but by the time the marriage for A@@ rad itself twice opened up to Czech sugar mag@@ na@@ adi Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ lo@@ ch and Climate pose his famous pa@@ int@@ ings , his father had already become the seventh largest bank in H@@ ab@@ s@@ burg E@@ mp@@ ire .
however , A@@ de@@ let did not draw all the gla@@ mo@@ rous life in which he belon@@ ged .
if you look at the &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; , it is hard to believe that the later side of life was infected by this great Lady &apos;s soci@@ alism and dre@@ am@@ t of travel from the Soviet Union .
in 19@@ 63 , when Fer@@ din@@ and B@@ lo@@ ch decided to order his hus@@ band &apos;s portfolio from Climate , it was the last six @-@ minute pain@@ ting officer in Vienna .
a cli@@ m@@ t ordered at the time cost 4 000 k@@ ron@@ es , a quarter of the price of a land building well located .
the fact that some of the sports ree suspected the champion &apos;s archa@@ te with a mo@@ del@@ li was not discoura@@ ged by the sugar mag@@ na@@ t .
as far as the A@@ dele@@ se is concerned , the only sure fact is that the relationship between the mo@@ del@@ li and the ar@@ tist in the course of their work continued to life .
Anne @-@ Marie O &apos;@@ Con@@ nor - &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; .
G@@ ood Kli@@ m@@ t &apos;s mas@@ ter@@ piece , A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri Por@@ t &apos;s extraordinary story , &quot; Var@@ ra@@ k 2016 , Al@@ do R@@ and@@ maa , translated English .
just before the work started , the cli@@ m@@ t had been to Ra@@ ven@@ nas San V@@ ita@@ res in Tun@@ as , and researchers think that it is there that the bri@@ lli@@ ant mo@@ sa@@ ic mo@@ sa@@ ges from the Em@@ pe@@ ror The@@ o@@ dor@@ a gave an ar@@ tist the idea of making the gol@@ den Por@@ ree A@@ dele@@ st a mo@@ sa@@ sa@@ i@@ ig@@ er .
the cli@@ m@@ t was presented in its &apos; Da@@ am gold &apos; in Vienna in 19@@ 48 , and around at the same time ( 19@@ 07 @-@ 19@@ 08 ) , another gol@@ den land was born &apos; modern &apos; .
the arts did not notice the simil@@ arity of two women .
how is Hitler linked to creativity ?
&quot; I think that , in memory of my friend climate , I owe it to him to make his work available to the public , &quot; said A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer a few years after leaving the ar@@ tist ( Climate died in February 19@@ 18 ) to the Director of Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere muse@@ um and wanted their family &apos;s Climate College to go to mus@@ eu@@ ms .
six years before death , the cli@@ m@@ mer had a mar@@ ks@@ ree prepared from A@@ dele@@ st .
she also asked her hus@@ band to leave her two Portuguese tre@@ asures and four G@@ ood Climate mul@@ lah@@ s to Austria Gal@@ der in February 19@@ 25 .
he gave his glo@@ ves to the nur@@ ses of Mari@@ ana and Lu@@ ca .
one year after the cli@@ m@@ t had finished &apos; Austrian Appendix Mon@@ a &apos; , attempts had been made to access the A@@ ka@@ de@@ mines of Vi@@ in Ka@@ ag@@ ines , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Ad@@ ol@@ f Hitler , but fell through the drawing board .
although Hitler &apos;s later anti @-@ S@@ emit@@ ism is sometimes seen as the reason why Jewish profes@@ sors did not receive him into the A@@ ca@@ de@@ my , none of his extra@@ cts was actually Jewish .
in any case , the task of Gal@@ der in Austria referred to in the testa@@ ment had changed considerably since 19@@ 39 - it was important that the rich Jewish gar@@ ages in Vienna find decent work for the Naz@@ is .
Hitler &apos;s personal wealth of art also served some of the work at home , but not those of the climate .
Si@@ x@@ ty years after Nazi art rob@@ ber@@ y , the ten @-@ year @-@ old dispute between the Austrian Government and the he@@ irs of B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ kers began .
let me just mention here that when &apos; S@@ innovations &apos; are seen in Vienna in the Bel@@ ve@@ d@@ ere Cas@@ tle , A@@ del B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bau@@ eri &apos;s &apos; Da@@ ami gold &apos; must be viewed as travelling to New York to Ne@@ ue Gal@@ der .
and , before Vienna , read through the abo@@ ve@@ mentioned book .
even if you do not plan to go to the qua@@ ke &apos;s work , because my emo@@ tion at least , after the closure of the book , more Nazi and Jewish issues than the ma@@ gic and mo@@ ll A@@ di B@@ lo@@ ch @-@ Bauer sold to the dollar .
so not so much a sports ree , rather a relatives &apos; life - and a very moving story .
the events were significantly facilitated by the relatives of the Bau@@ kers mentioned at the beginning of the book .
17 @-@ year @-@ old flooding in Canada was very close to Estonian records
in living terms , gold was 200 m of its own ad@@ ven@@ ue to its own personal record , very close to sw@@ im@@ ming 2.@@ 16.@@ 62 .
the Ti@@ pp@@ mark comes from a 17 @-@ year old festi@@ val every week since it became a 2.@@ 16.@@ 58 Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ship in Canada , the Pri@@ it A@@ av@@ ik U@@ ju@@ ration bloc .
the gold finally esca@@ ped , or ten @-@ A @-@ fin@@ alists .
she went through her distance from 2.@@ 15.@@ 76 and achieved a good seventh prize with a powerful new top level .
from Estonia &apos;s record ( 2.@@ 15.@@ 13 ) , A@@ lina K@@ end@@ zi@@ or@@ i ( 2.@@ 15.@@ 13 ) , the Gol@@ den has remained a little over half a second .
in Estonia &apos;s annual ranking , gold has risen third , and its fresh record of excellence is the fifth ever result of Estonia .
a young hope for the future is beginning at the adult Cha@@ mpi@@ on@@ ships in Canada at 100 m , 200 m and 400 m in bal@@ king and 200 m@@ m and 400 metres in bun@@ dling .
last week , Canadian je@@ wel@@ le@@ ry champi@@ ons took place in Tor@@ onto , and gold also made successful head@@ lines there .
he won 200 m in am@@ munition with a time of 2.@@ 0@@ 3.@@ 22 .
so quickly it was floo@@ ded as a distant spokes@@ man by the last half in 2008 .
from Gol@@ den times in Estonia , only the record Estonian E@@ lina Par@@ wor@@ ka has distan@@ ced itself from it .
as a Canadian pro@@ tag@@ on@@ ist , a hundred m me@@ dal was won in a great personal record and a new Estonian season mar@@ ath@@ le@@ tes 5@@ 6.@@ 66 .
for example , the older Ker@@ tu ly Al@@ ne@@ k of her year has distan@@ ced it by just one hundre@@ d@@ th faster .
she reached her top level level with a further 100 m in the opening of a letter of 1.@@ 0@@ 3.@@ 69 when she reti@@ red .
at a distance of half , he only obtained seven seats when he s@@ tun@@ ned in the final room 2.@@ 17.@@ 31 .
gold is currently heading the Estonian ranking at four different inter@@ vals .
President T@@ ru@@ mp goes on holiday , critics bur@@ n teet@@ h
the time has come - that is to say a rela@@ xation for the US President , Donald T@@ ru@@ dal .
however , as the T@@ ru@@ ker has so far been one of the President who has taken off the most holiday days , critics are already inc@@ iting teet@@ h .
according to the US Security and CN@@ N , the President envisages 17 @-@ day leave in a water @-@ free gol@@ f club in B@@ ed@@ min@@ ster , located in New Jer@@ ina .
although presidential leave began yesterday , the issue of leave against T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i has been speaking for a week .
they are complaining too often about the Olympic Games .
it is the President &apos;s usual practice to spend a week exchanging his F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and New Jer@@ sey in cotton .
incidentally , the T@@ ru@@ mp has not been cleared by the President for its 19@@ 6 term .
for example , George W@@ . Bush has already reached 67 days on holiday , while Barack Obama has half as much as T@@ ru@@ mp , but 21 days .
however , the Olympic Games tend to forget things quickly .
a few days after becoming President , T@@ ru@@ mp in his recei@@ pt said &apos; 60 minutes &apos; that there would be no time for long holidays during his counter@@ part , because a great deal has to be done .
he also expressed his outra@@ ge at Barack Obama &apos;s leave three years ago .
the current president wrote on Twitter at that time , &apos; while Obama is on holiday , he plays gol@@ f , the brak@@ es and the j@@ ung@@ le groups , journalists in Italy are pul@@ ling their heads from the sun &apos; .
according to the officials of the White House , a 17 @-@ day gol@@ f club visit will not have any s@@ lip@@ page .
instead , it is officially called &apos; working time &apos; during which the Olympic Games do not have time to read or other memor@@ ies .
in addition , rest periods had to have a second reason .
that is why the special pension system on the west of the White House is being replaced and therefore all staff had to leave it .
the West also belongs to the O@@ val Office and the other premises of the President &apos;s office .
&apos;@@ I do not believe that any of you would like to be in the West in August , if there are 38 degrees and there is no con@@ ste@@ l@@ lation &apos; , said L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters , speaking in the White House , who stressed that the President would continue to work during the holiday period .
where President T@@ ru@@ mp will spend 17 days , you will get an idea of video .
block the critics on Facebook : do not stand for state office unless you tolerate the criticism of the voters .
the father of our country knew a great deal about unfavourable media coverage .
the Americans lo@@ ved George Washington , but the newspapers did not go long to get him bo@@ gged down for everything from internal politics to his political principles .
the criticism , of course , upset him .
but he did not force his critics to remain silent .
because , in 17@@ 83 , Washington said , &apos; freedom of expression can be taken away from us and , more quickly and in silence , we may be led to slaugh@@ ter@@ houses like sheep &apos; .
this brings me to Mar@@ y@@ land Governor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work hard to be more like Washington .
the Ho@@ gan &apos;s sub@@ missions have blocked and deleted at least 450 people who expressed their views on the official Facebook page .
and at the beginning of the week , the American Civil Liberties Union MO@@ AC@@ L@@ U therefore brought him to justice .
the Ku@@ ber@@ ner &apos;s officers te@@ mb@@ ed the action empty and web comment tri@@ um@@ ph@@ ed out of &apos; who interests ? &apos; .
&apos;@@ It is Facebook , &apos; many have said .
but that does matter .
and this is particularly important when it comes to a man like Ho@@ gan .
it is an ama@@ zing popular Re@@ publi@@ can govern@@ or in an overwhel@@ mingly democratic state .
his approval rate is the second best among the 50 govern@@ ors of the country .
Ho@@ gan is not an un@@ wise , responsive cli@@ ck .
it has led the State firmly and has remained firm in its principles .
in addition , he has used Facebook as the main tool for communication with his constituents rather gene@@ rously , for example , to present his own b@@ rick heads in the wake of the chemical season for the first time .
therefore , the Governor &apos;s website in FT@@ As is a public forum with official labelling , managed by taxpayers &apos; dollars &apos; paid staff , which is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
Ho@@ gan &apos;s spokes@@ person , Ame@@ lia Ch@@ esse , defended the behaviour of the Governor in an interview given to The Washington Posselt , claiming that blocking comments was nothing more than a mo@@ re@@ ation .
however , it is all too easy to pa@@ int a picture of online Internet checks , spa@@ m de@@ pu@@ ties or people full of anger .
the post inter@@ viewed a number of people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
this is what they are all about in order to communicate with their elected leaders : the teacher , the owner and passport holders , not Internet checks .
they all said that their comments were respec@@ table , well thought @-@ out and not at all Roma .
in his post , Pas@@ tor quoted the Bi@@ ble , op@@ pressing Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catho@@ lic@@ s .
a lawyer from Mar@@ y@@ lan@@ s Bo@@ wi@@ e , L@@ ak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ra@@ man , did not encourage hatred , but rather hate crime .
&quot; I poli@@ tely agreed that I am disappointed because he has not responded to hate crime or other recent news reports , &quot; he wrote The mail news story in the country of comment .
&apos;@@ nor do I like the idea that , if many people comment on the same subject , some will immediately call it an in@@ difference collective effort rather than admit that it is a great deal of concern to citizens &apos; .
what the govern@@ ors &apos; office called a &apos; targeted spa@@ m attack &apos; would probably invite others to &apos; public support &apos; .
the Facebook era allows messages to be easily fitting , simply blocking criticism or dele@@ ting a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in the past when , to do the same , workers had to be expelled so that they could gather newspapers with critical leadership letters and bur@@ n them or arrest prote@@ sters and force them to remain silent .
but that is exactly what happens today , just digital .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to be criticised for being too@@ th@@ less on Facebook and other social media .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i has taken users of Twitter to court who have been blocked from Twitter .
one of the first mar@@ ty@@ ous sentences on this issue was handed down in Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a last week .
in Alexand@@ ria , Judge James C. C@@ ac@@ her@@ is , the US Com@@ man@@ der , decided that the chair of the Lou@@ d@@ oun@@ i Coun@@ ty Council breached the first revision of the constitution when he blocked the vo@@ ter on his Facebook page .
in K@@ ash@@ tu@@ ck@@ ys , the Governor Mat@@ t B@@ ev@@ in ( R ) also visited AC@@ L@@ U Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so difficult .
during Washington , affordable postal costs had a similar effect to the Internet .
between 17@@ 76 and 18@@ 00 , the number of newspapers and anon@@ ymous wri@@ ters ty@@ pi@@ fied his leadership .
and even then Washington had to face up to anon@@ ymous checks .
the people wrote letters to newspapers from pseu@@ do @-@ y@@ ths such as Ju@@ ric@@ ol@@ a , Val@@ eri@@ us , Bel@@ is@@ ari@@ us and Por@@ ti@@ us , making the decisions of Washington land .
according to historic documents repeated in the project to collect the signatures of George Washington on the web , he was bu@@ ried in a c@@ abinet of petitions criticising his views on the agreements of friendship , trade and shipping with Britain .
but he did not force them to remain silent .
freedom of expression , differences of opinion and debate are the foundation of our country .
and good governance means accepting this .

&quot; players see the path in their best form , it is in a gl@@ ori@@ ous state .
Jer@@ ry has done an excellent job in establishing this place .
he is a keen supporter of the gol@@ f f@@ ist game and proud of what has been achieved here .
this will allow an excellent presentation of the path . &quot;
an Eng@@ lis@@ h@@ man will ever wait with interest to be able to defend the title for the first time , although the man has won both the European Tou@@ l and the European challenge in his 32 @-@ year career .
&apos;@@ This is a very special feeling , &apos; said a be@@ ac@@ on player in Sou@@ th@@ por@@ tis .
&quot; I could not defend my Ex@@ t@@ rema@@ du@@ ra O@@ Antwerp title because it was taken off the competition wall one year after my victory .
it is ag@@ ony to come back to this channel .
it is an excellent place to play gol@@ f .
I remember last year &apos;s memor@@ ies , and for me and my wife , Shar@@ on , last year was a special victory .
it was a very special time that we always live in . &quot;
on the ground , G@@ ary Or@@ r , who joined the European architecture of the gen@@ i@@ us earlier this year , will return to the competition once again .
this is his first event in Scotland since the participation of A@@ ber@@ de@@ en asset Management Secretary O@@ pen@@ il in 2013 .
&apos;@@ It is always a little more significant to play at home , &apos; said Hel@@ en@@ s@@ burg &apos;s man , Or@@ r .
&apos;@@ Wel@@ sh money was good , but you also felt extra applause .
I have enjoyed playing again enormously and I have shown quite a decent gol@@ f game .
I am pleased that things have progres@@ sed so far . &quot;

it is a rare pil@@ ots in Papua mÃ¤@@ ki , a former col@@ ony in the Netherlands , which was added to Indonesia in 19@@ 69 following a referendum that created controversy , forcing just 1 0@@ 26 old newspapers to vote before their eyes .
the Dutch sup@@ rema@@ cy has encouraged the move to move swiftly against the J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta Government , which is still keeping the region under its strong control , by keeping out foreign journalists and human rights supervisors .
in 2003 , the province was officially appointed P@@ ope and Western Pa@@ pu@@ a , leaving the eastern part of the island for independent Papua New Guinea .
the majority is both remote and abandoned ; in order to get here 90 minutes from Ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ur@@ vis , the capital of the province , will have to fly from Ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ur@@ vis to N@@ abi@@ fix and will subsequently pass a five @-@ hour journey with the ren@@ tal vehicle .
there is no public transport .
a city of around 19 000 inhabitants is made up of be@@ ds surrounded by rub@@ ble ta@@ ps and covers ru@@ in@@ ous iron ro@@ of@@ s that have been turned into y@@ el@@ low lig@@ ni@@ tes .
very few indicators have taken the journey here , not to mention journalists , nor have almost any foreigners been here .

Papua Leone is the poorest province in Slovakia , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line , and inf@@ ant mortality and il@@ literacy statistics are one of the worst in Asia .
but it is also a gold @-@ rich country in Indonesia .
just 100 km from P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , which is a mountainous province with a population of 153 000 inhabitants of New Jer@@ sey , is the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , G@@ ras@@ berg , which belongs to F@@ ri@@ tten Mc@@ Mor@@ an , a company operating in P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x .
in 2015 alone , F@@ ree@@ exports were extra@@ cted here with around USD 3.@@ 1 billion worth of gold and cop@@ per .
in addition , it is possible to import raw wood supplies with an estimated value of USD 78 billion .
however , these ri@@ ches are a source of suffering for boats because they are responsible for the suff@@ oc@@ ating presence of a powerful Slovak army .
the 2005 study by The New York Times showed that F@@ ree@@ exports cost approximately USD 20 million to local military and military units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to USD 150 000 to one of the officers .
P@@ ope efforts to secure greater autonomy are threatening this gol@@ den h@@ all and are ru@@ th@@ lessly displaced .
more than 500 000 boats have been killed since 19@@ 69 , according to human rights activists , and thousands more have been ra@@ ped , tortured and imprisoned by the Sri Lankan army .
according to the Asian Committee on Human Rights , mass slaughter of genocide in the coun@@ ties belonging to the Como@@ ros was a measure of the war in the 1970s .
last year alone , over 3 900 peaceful protest@@ ors were arrested by the police in the region of Indonesia .
the 2016 report by the Chief Official Journal of Bir@@ s@@ b@@ ane , &apos; We shall lose all &apos; , contains testi@@ mony to the atrocities committed in the previous year , such as extra@@ judicial executions , torture ( rape and electricity strikes are particularly pre@@ valent according to another report ) and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as such incidents take place every week , &quot; says the Sri Lankan research@@ er , Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Human Rights Watch .
the win@@ ds have been watered down even more strongly , as Papua emb@@ ers have caused the influx of new settlements from elsewhere in Indonesia .
Eigh@@ ty @-@ five per cent of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians , but demographic change is changing because of the arrival of black @-@ scale economic migrants in the islands of Jaa@@ va , Kal@@ im@@ an@@ tan , Su@@ ma@@ tra and S@@ ula@@ w@@ es from the People &apos;s Assembly of Indonesia .
Con@@ cer@@ ning clo@@ thes of sho@@ ts are sold in the open press and mixed vegetables by ga@@ do @-@ ga@@ do , which is st@@ olen with ground level .
local authorities cannot compete with them .
&quot; migrants started selling chic@@ ken and vegetables more cheap@@ ly than local boats on the traditional market , &quot; explained the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Mrs Lynne born in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i who was working in Ja@@ y@@ ap@@ ur@@ i , the capital of the province .
&apos;@@ The Can@@ aries &apos; &#91; Women &#93; therefore lose their market share . &apos;
the President of Indonesia , J@@ ok@@ o W@@ id@@ o@@ do , known as Jo@@ ko@@ w among the people , pledged to address these inequalities and human rights violations in P@@ ope in his 2014 election campaign .
the former bot@@ tle won on its way to J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta &apos;s presidential Pal@@ ace in Papua 29 regions of 27 , including P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
but the P@@ ope has changed very little and the local people feel chea@@ ted .
&apos;@@ O@@ ur hearts have been broken down because in 2014 , Jo@@ ko@@ w &apos;s expectation that he will live up to our hopes of restoring justice is &apos; .
in fact , just two months after Jo@@ ko@@ w took office in October , the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i bo@@ thered down .
on 7 December 2014 , 11 children sat up in most of the whe@@ el on a Christmas scale when two Nig@@ erian soldiers appeared on a motor@@ cycle .
coming children told them that they should include the front lights .
according to the local passport , Y@@ a@@ ve@@ dt T@@ usk , one of the soldiers was insul@@ ted by their tone of voting and subsequently returned with four soldiers .
according to the victims and specta@@ tors , under the influence of d@@ run@@ k soldiers hun@@ g behind children and dece@@ ive them with their gun@@ s .
then one of the soldiers shoo@@ k among the children .
one child , 16 years old Y@@ u@@ li@@ an@@ us Ye@@ im@@ ot , was beaten so cru@@ el@@ ly that he fell into the house .
a few hours later , the ne@@ ar@@ by electoral Commission was bur@@ nt down and things further es@@ tu@@ alised the next day .
approximately 1 000 young Papua scrutinise men , women and children gathered in a football pit@@ ch before the local police department and the military command centre to demand justice .
they we@@ ed cement @-@ repair bo@@ ilers and presented a tri@@ ck of Papua me@@ e &apos;s tri@@ be wa@@ ita @-@ tan@@ k , which ran around and bu@@ ried poultry s@@ ongs .
some prote@@ sters started to shoo@@ t at the police and the military .
on the increase in anger , a bul@@ l@@ doz@@ er was sent to the soldiers through the gu@@ er@@ ri@@ l@@ la . &apos; whereas the crow@@ d is more than three times resistance , let them down , &apos; it was said in the official document , which has been shown to be a magaz@@ ine of time but which has not been given to local media donors .
in Ke@@ go Ko@@ to , the oldest city of Ye@@ re@@ mi@@ as Ka@@ y@@ me ( 56 ) , the city of Kenya experienced a threatening threat and called for peace by asking for a crow@@ d to go home .
nobody had the will to listen .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen I swit@@ ched around , I was suddenly shot in the left , &apos; he said to the magaz@@ ine in his private col@@ ours on the ver@@ ge of a disability house .
we still do not know who the shoo@@ t was , but says that this month the ranks of the soldiers gathered came from .
&apos;@@ The people were many , the ic@@ on of the ic@@ eb@@ er@@ g , &apos; add him .
Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w , a local man who saw her shot on her do@@ or@@ step , said three times .
&apos;@@ I would like to come to him and study him through the body to make sure that he is , &apos; said the magaz@@ ine at the time in Y@@ oh@@ ano , who , like many indicators , uses only one name .
&quot; I saw him dead ... S@@ anti@@ le@@ en . &quot;
the Chief Police officer , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said to repor@@ ters that he was only ensuring the safety of his department because it was attacked .
&apos;@@ We must defend ourselves when we are threatened with killing , &apos; said Vice @-@ President P@@ ud@@ jo S@@ ul@@ is@@ ti@@ yo , the spokes@@ man for the T@@ reasury , in 2015 .
&apos;@@ This is a matter of life and death &apos; .
according to Human Rights Watch , five young protest@@ ors were killed and there were many injured .
the news of the killings only came to J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ti the next day .
three weeks later , Jo@@ ko@@ w Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ ras made a passion@@ ate speech in which he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised to deal with the abuses in P@@ ope .
&apos;@@ I want to resolve this case immediately so that it never happens again in future &apos; .
in October 2016 , the Minister for Security , W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , said that he would introduce an ADR mechanism for the resolution of crimes against human rights .
but almost immediately , there were ex@@ cus@@ es .
&quot; most crimes occurred a long time ago .
some of these occurred in the 1990s and the early 200@@ 0s .
the point is that we are committed to resolving these crimes , but we must follow certain processes , &quot; he said .
however , speaking time at J@@ ak@@ ar@@ tas on 5 June , W@@ ir@@ an@@ to with@@ drew his words saying that he had no intention of creating a P@@ ope mechanism to deal with complaints .
instead , he said that &apos; everything will be solved by law &apos; .
W@@ ir@@ an@@ to , accused of crimes against human rights by the UN of more than 1 000 deaths in East Timor during the bloody independence referendum in 1999 , said that 11 crimes against human rights had already been resolved in P@@ ania , including the events in P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
the families of the victims of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i have accepted such allegations with g@@ loom@@ y mistrust .
&apos;@@ I have been listened to four times in the last three years , but there has been no progress , &apos; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&apos;@@ I am ti@@ red . &apos;
he says he still lives in fear years on .
&apos;@@ I am afraid , &apos; he says .
&apos;@@ I am afraid I am being arrested by troops , I am afraid I am shot . &apos;
his bro@@ ther Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us confirmed the view that the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i fear destroying this incident .
he said that he got the army out of hand after he had helped to bur@@ y the four victims .
&apos;@@ Fol@@ low@@ ing the bodies of death , the army came to seek me , &apos; he says .
the celeb@@ rations have not stopped .
on Tuesday , the Ye@@ meni police shoo@@ t village population was shot in D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ i in neighbouring P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
one person was killed and 17 w@@ ounded , including children , when it became a war between the village population and the head of the construction company , who refused to transport an informed man to hospital .
this man , 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ uri@@ an@@ us D@@ ou@@ w , dro@@ w@@ ned into a ne@@ ar@@ by river , died on his way to hospital .
the last village population prote@@ sted on the site against the company &apos;s office .
according to the police , village residents st@@ oned police officers , which they responded with warning visits .
however , according to local claims , mobile British people ( the police armed by Indonesia ) started to shoo@@ t at the people , killing a single person .
&apos;@@ We were very panic , we fear re@@ tali@@ ation , &apos; said to the magaz@@ ine the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ ing Ba@@ dia i , who lives near hospital and saw injured in@@ puts .
&apos;@@ I have been hiding in my house for two days &apos; .
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ a@@ i Parliament has called for the prosecution of the police officers involved and for the police to be pul@@ led back to the region .
the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i has always been a problem area for the Government of Indonesia .
the lack of meaningful development n@@ ou@@ ris@@ hes the dis@@ satisfaction of the male , m@@ th , dan@@ g@@ and swe@@ et tri@@ bes living in Papua hal@@ j@@ enda@@ tan .
many of them have joined the Free Trade Organisation ( V@@ PL ) Association army of GCC insur@@ gen@@ ts , which , according to its own accord , protects the rights of boats by carrying out casu@@ al attacks and kid@@ napp@@ ings among Tibetan soldiers .
some V@@ PL leaders come from P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , including Ta@@ di@@ us Y@@ o@@ g and Daniel Y@@ u@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response , under the pretext of protecting the sovereignty of the state , the army has been ar@@ resting in P@@ ania over recent years and arbitrarily detained thousands of people .
some of them will never appear again .
in the meantime , P@@ ani@@ a@@ ths are known as &apos; tragic forgotten site &apos; .
poverty fe@@ eds dis@@ satisfaction .
the small ri@@ ce sold in most s@@ wine is too expensive for local purchases .
b is equally in@@ accessible .
people grow all their food at break@@ fast levels , plus some fruit and vegetables .
farming is the job of women , each of whom can care for four or five bac@@ hel@@ ors .
they usually keep most of the harvest on the family , while the rest are sold on the local market .
ten b@@ ars cost only 10 000 blocks in Indonesia ( 75 cents ) .
over time , economic imbalances between indigenous boats and new migrants , who have come across since the opening of new routes at N@@ ab@@ ire airport .
the few jobs that exist are going to be better educated and more prosperous migrants .
P@@ ope users themselves often lack capital or the necessary skills to do a competitive business .
&apos;@@ Young people are not interested in leaving the village because there is no jobs or money here , &apos; says John Go@@ ba@@ i , Chairman of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i tri@@ bal Council .
isolation is keeping the eyes of the world away from P@@ ope .
furthermore , restrictions on foreign media remain tough .
earlier this year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le L@@ ong@@ cha@@ mp were expelled from P@@ ope because &apos; they did not follow the relevant practices &apos; , even though they had been given a rare film authorisation .
according to Mr K@@ ine , Deputy Chair of the Asian department of Human Rights Watch , the election promises made by Jo@@ ko@@ w have not been implemented to remove restrictions on reports to promote transparency and development .
&quot; Indonesia , from the most une@@ as@@ y provinces in the East and from the Western P@@ ope reports , is threatening new threats to journalists to reject the Security visa and place a black list , &quot; said in his statement .
the lack of a media look means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is largely limited to its immediate neighbours .
in March , six Pacific countries ex@@ hor@@ ted the Security Agreements , Na@@ ur@@ u , B@@ ela@@ u , Tu@@ pain , Mar@@ shall Islands and Sol@@ om@@ on Islands of the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate &apos; various large @-@ scale crimes &apos; in P@@ ope , including the shooting of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i .
these same countries have also historically supported V@@ PL .
Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , spokes@@ man for Foreign Affairs in Indonesia , dismissed the charges of the charge , saying J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta for journalists : &apos; democracy and freedom of the press still applies in Indonesia , so that evidence of cases against human rights is difficult to bur@@ y &apos; .
the local people want more foreign governments to be noted .
when the Dutch official delegation , led by the Human Rights Envoy of the country , Mr Van B@@ ari , visited Ja@@ y@@ a@@ pu@@ rat on 4 May , the local people interrupted their silence at the meeting , but the source of what they wanted to remain anon@@ ymous , urging me : &apos; we want freedom &apos; .
in Indonesia , there will be new presidential elections in 2019 , but boats do not believe that they will vote for Jo@@ ko@@ w again .
&apos;@@ Jo@@ ko@@ w is a man of good intentions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the shooting of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i &apos; says Ho@@ ba@@ i , Chairman of the tri@@ bal Council .
he wants to tell Jo@@ ko@@ w that , apart from the fact that the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i are constantly living under threat from a pre@@ da@@ tory army , they are struggling with misery due to poor education and health services .
according to Go@@ ba@@ i , the people of P@@ ani@@ a@@ i , like other boats , consider their vote cast on Jo@@ ko@@ w to be a debt they have to pay .
&apos;@@ The@@ y &apos;t need money , they want justice , &apos; he says .
despite his il@@ ls and intimidation , the families of the cap@@ tured victims of the P@@ ani@@ a@@ i fire were still struggling with the last symbolic resistance they swe@@ pt in one of the victims &apos; bodies of police stations and military in@@ competence into the land in question .
knowing that justice may never be put on its feet , they at least do not allow those responsible to forget their crimes .
&apos;@@ One of our family members was killed &apos; says with the head of Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us .
&apos;@@ What else can we do ? &apos;
came on the eve of Du@@ ba@@ i Tor@@ ch for the second time now .
on Friday , one of the highest residential buildings in the world was bu@@ ried in Du@@ ba@@ i , forcing hundreds of inhabitants to escape from this 3@@ 37 metres de@@ ser@@ t and 79 regular buildings .
this is the second fire that has been ra@@ va@@ ged in just two years by the high @-@ ranking , which happens to be called the Tor@@ ch , the T@@ rup@@ kov@@ y@@ tor .
the building was evacu@@ ated , none of the injuries were reported and no direct fire causes were presented .
&quot; we s@@ le@@ ep and wake up to the fire camps and the fear of people .
we would expect training boats and it took us around 10 minutes to get down the 50@@ th floor , &quot; said to Re@@ u@@ ter@@ s a resident who called himself George .
according to Du@@ ba@@ i &apos;s civil protection officers , fire @-@ fighters even deleted at around 4 a.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 G@@ MT ) and were cooling buildings .
the government said that they were working to ensure shelter for those affected .
this incident may once again raise concerns about the safety of high @-@ quality external materials throughout the world .
an investigation carried out by the Tor@@ ch G@@ over@@ ning Board in the wake of the 2015 fire found that the worst damage was caused by the de@@ res@@ sive panels and isolation of the or@@ bit - the external surface .
the British police have said that they believe that the isolation of the London G@@ ren@@ portfolio T@@ ow@@ er and the amb@@ assa@@ dors &apos; panels could contribute to the rapid spread of the fire there in June , which killed around 80 people .
see : these phones are expected to become sales hu@@ bs in the autumn
T@@ EE@@ B and coal are time@@ fra@@ mes for technological investors , which will then make phone manufacturers public their new models of excellence .
in the spring , Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , Hu@@ aw@@ ei P@@ 10 and S@@ ony X@@ peri@@ a X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um came to the wall , and new h@@ it@@ t phones are expected for the boys in the autumn as well .
according to the Telecoms marketing and sale Director , Christian jan Se@@ ema , today &apos;s flagship ships are characterised by an innovative design , an eye fast @-@ track phone , a ser@@ se @-@ servan@@ i 4@@ K resolution and an ultra @-@ fast process actor .
Sam@@ sun@@ g G@@ ala@@ x@@ y S@@ 8 , which is also at the forefront of the Estonian smar@@ t@@ phone sales table , gave rise to high visibility in the technology world .
the autumn will allow smart hu@@ bs to be even more quickly loaded , more resilient bat@@ teries , a better quality camer@@ a and greater water and dust security .
he added that rum@@ ours can already make assumptions and predict the four top models that probably con@@ qu@@ er today &apos;s sales age .
these four smart phone top @-@ level models will be available to the shop in autumn this year .
the expected i@@ P@@ hone 8 and i@@ P@@ hone 8 Plus should reach the bo@@ ilers as early as mid @-@ September .
the rum@@ ours of what the new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it are spreading greatly .
if i@@ P@@ hone 7 did not bring significant differences alongside the 6@@ s of i@@ P@@ hone , then in the case of the tenth birth@@ day of Apple , it is expected that the new model will be completely different from the previous ones .
four pa@@ ints have been spoken about : black , white , rose and ch@@ ro@@ mi@@ um .
one of the elements of the new design is probably a screen covering the entire front @-@ of @-@ the @-@ phone window , lost the home and the fingerprints have been built on the screen .
the foun@@ der of Apple design , J@@ on@@ y@@ I@@ ve , demands that the new model of i@@ P@@ hone look like a glass .
there has also been talk of an i@@ P@@ hone C@@ era@@ mic version .
in addition to the e@@ lep@@ h@@ ant , u@@ plo@@ ad @-@ free re@@ charging and an even higher quality camer@@ a , faster A@@ 11 processes can be expected .
it is certainly one of the most expected smart phones for a year .
the launch of the new model G@@ ala@@ x@@ y merger 8 will take place on 23 August .
there have been many rum@@ ours about what the new G@@ ala@@ x@@ y Move 8 will look like .
Ad@@ mittedly , there is even more to do with the business users and S pen will allow for even greater fun@@ ction@@ alities .
the telecom fund should have two camer@@ as , one of which is flat @-@ rol@@ led and the other has a tele@@ scope with a narrow view .
at present , nobody knows what two tab@@ oo@@ s are capable of camer@@ a , but in any case , it is the Z@@ sun@@ g first test , which is definitely comparable to the i@@ P@@ hone 8 in terms of quality .
however , we are eag@@ er@@ ly awaiting 23 August .
although Nokia has been selling three smart phones with Nokia 6 this year , there is still a shortage of their flagship - Nokia 8 , which is already being presented on 16 August .
we expect from No@@ ki@@ an 5.@@ 3 @-@ month @-@ round a screen and from Qu@@ al@@ com@@ m S@@ nap@@ dra@@ g@@ on 8@@ 35 processes and a more robust passage .
Nokia also talks about alu@@ mini@@ um cor@@ ps and a significant level of water and customs certainty from IP@@ 68 .
like the Sam@@ su@@ ng@@ t , the new model of Nokia has two tab@@ oo@@ s in the camer@@ a , which is produced by an opti@@ mist company Z@@ van@@ y .
while S@@ ony @-@ proof flagship has been X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um so far , the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smart phones with even more innovative functions will be added in the near future .
we are waiting for a smart phone , which is a bit more modest than X@@ Z Pre@@ mi@@ um , but at least with the same good or the same camer@@ a .
there has been speculation about the new model of S@@ ony that the screen is at least dry .
what reality brings us to see very soon , because traditionally S@@ ony , its autumn flag vessel , has unve@@ iled IF@@ A at international technological level , which will take place from 1 to 6 September this year .
T@@ ru@@ mp Mexico was pres@@ su@@ ris@@ ed by T@@ ru@@ mp Mexico for payment of the border wall , according to trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts le@@ ak@@ ed telephone calls
the Washington post made public phone calls between US President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i and between Mexico and Australia .
on 27 January , En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ et@@ o , President of Mexico , travelled telephone to stop declaring publicly that he did not intend to pay for the proposed border wall .
the American President bo@@ wed with him for denoun@@ cing the wall publicly , saying , &apos; You must not say it to the press &apos; .
the T@@ ru@@ mp has e@@ rec@@ ted his presidential campaign promise to build a long way along the southern border of the United States and to make Mexico pay for this project .
trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts were also published from his first speech with the Austr@@ alian Prime Minister , Malcolm Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l , which reveals an intense debate .
the T@@ ru@@ mp said to Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l that an agreement by which the United States takes on refugees to Australia is &apos; ridiculous &apos; , &apos; ner@@ v@@ ous &apos; and &apos; stu@@ pid &apos; ; he claimed that the agreement that was made under the Obama Administration would give him the impression of &apos; lead &apos; , as he has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States .
the panel ended its speech by telling Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l that &apos; this was the most un@@ pleasant speech of the day &apos; .
the state court did not discuss a complaint by the city of Li@@ ines of O@@ C MR@@ P in the case where the town of Tar@@ tu rejected their offer for bus and coach transport between July 2019 and 20@@ 29 .
it is a letter that rejected Li@@ ines in the city of O@@ C MR@@ P at Tar@@ tu bus procurement because the offer did not meet the requirements , An@@ four A@@ pu@@ tin , Head of Government Law Service for Tar@@ tu , explained .
this is a procurement process for public transport within the Tar@@ tu town , for the period from 1.@@ 0@@ 7.@@ 2019 to 3@@ 0.@@ 6.@@ 20@@ 29 .
the city of MR@@ P Li@@ ines compla@@ ined against the decision of the Tar@@ tu Dis@@ tri@@ ct Court before the Supreme Court .
the national courts did not take this action .
although many people complain in the social media that the l@@ ung@@ le from the We@@ ek@@ end festi@@ val disrup@@ ts their night and the entire city is full of suff@@ e@@ rers under the influence of drinking , there are also many who have no say at all about the festi@@ val lasting on the be@@ ach .
I am even positively surprised that the shops were so poli@@ te !
I did not see any confusion or dis@@ cour@@ tes@@ y .
even if I saw kind@@ ness , there is a col@@ os@@ sal wave .
&apos;@@ It is all well and good to come , to be pleased and to know the joy of 2004 , which has sta@@ yed like winter &apos; , he happily adds .
the wave of rub@@ ble from the do@@ se is not a sha@@ mb@@ les .
if he still heard in the middle of the city that music is being played on the be@@ ach , now music has not yet reached his home list .
&apos;@@ Bu@@ t , I hope I hear &apos; , he happily says .
the floor in Ag@@ nes also talks about the fact that the Grand F@@ esti@@ val is rather good for Per@@ sons - that is why it makes a significant contribution to the turnover of local merchan@@ ts .
furthermore , it welcomes that the summer capital has come to such a large extent .

Pe@@ ar@@ son cuts 3 000 more jobs and reduces dividen@@ ds to revita@@ lise business
the British educational company Pe@@ ar@@ son said on Friday that it would cut another 3 000 jobs and reduce its distance dividen@@ ds by 72 % , thus launching another restructuring programme to address the dangers of business .
the jobs to be covered , which will be laid off according to John F@@ all@@ on , the CE@@ O , most likely at the end of 2018 and early 2019 , will add to the 4 000 posts lost during the previous restructuring .
Pe@@ ar@@ son announced in May a further GBP 300 million ( USD 3@@ 94 million ) reduction programme to try to revive a business that has been hit by the transfer of fast @-@ start digital learning .
the company , which agreed to sell its partner company , Ber@@ tel@@ s@@ mann , Pen@@ gu@@ in R@@ and@@ om House , last month , said that their expectation of a year has not changed since the announcement of a 1 % increase in sales of GBP 2.@@ 05 billion in the first half of the year .

the attack in K@@ abu@@ l : a NATO soldi@@ er killed in suicide attack
the suicide bom@@ b@@ ers , according to officials , attacked military con@@ vo@@ ys in K@@ abu@@ l , the capital of Afghanistan , killing several NATO soldiers and w@@ ounded several others .
the NATO statement said that five soldiers and interpre@@ ter were injured .
according to un@@ approved local reports , three civilians were also killed in the incident in the town of Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ hi .
this bom@@ bing is the last of the acts of violence that have be@@ fallen Afghanistan this month , with more than 30 deaths in the Her@@ at mos@@ que attack on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ b@@ er killed two people near the Iraqi E@@ mb@@ assy in K@@ abu@@ l .
NATO &apos;s statement said that there was an explosion on Thursday evening when joint pat@@ ro@@ ls with the Afghan army were attacked by &apos; explo@@ sive rem@@ nan@@ ts made by man &apos; .
according to the statement , everything has been injured in a stable state and is being treated in the US military hospital in Bag@@ ra@@ m Air@@ port .
according to correspon@@ dent speakers , the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State ( Pakistan ) are a serious source of concern for NATO forces in Q@@ ar@@ ab@@ ag@@ hi in Bag@@ ra@@ m .
according to UN data , in the first half of 2017 , at least 16@@ 62 civilians have died in Afghanistan , some 20 % of them in capital .
at the end of July , at K@@ abu@@ l , the car bomb killed at least 30 people , mainly in the Shi@@ ite line .
according to the Taliban , they were behind the attack .
on 31 May , more than 150 people were killed by a major bomb attack in the centre of the city , which has caused most deaths in the country since the US @-@ led forces with@@ drew the Taliban from power in 2001 .
this violence highlights the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , while US President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp is considering increasing the number of US troops and police assisting the country .
according to the correspon@@ dent , the suicide attacks in K@@ abu@@ l in recent weeks have also caused a public crisis of confidence in the government , its policies and , in particular , President Ashraf G@@ h@@ ani .
in the EPA , after the decision to postpone the summer regulation was annul@@ led
the United States Environment Protection Agency ( United Nations Environmental Protection Protection Agency ) annul@@ led the decision to delay the establishment of a Obama regulation obli@@ ging states to limit emissions from the summer , one day after 15 states su@@ ed the Agency for this move .
in the EPA , it announced the decision to proceed late on Wednesday with the &apos; procedures for determining the content of the share@@ holder &apos; , saying that this demonstrates the Agency &apos;s commitment to cooperation with the States .
&quot; we believe that we need to engage in dialogue and listen to our partners in our states , &quot; said Scot@@ t P@@ ru@@ it@@ t in his statement .
P@@ ru@@ th had announced in June the intention of the EPA to def@@ er the levels of ozone content in different parts of the country in order to determine where its level of compliance with the most stringent air quality standard should be reduced by one year to the wall in 2018 .
the 15 predominantly democratic states , together with the C@@ olum@@ bia community , submitted an action on Tuesday , saying that this decision was unlawful .
President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s government has tried to bring back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama , which , according to T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i , is part of a broader plan for growth .
however , these efforts have provoked reactions among democrats and natural conservation groups , which are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health .
the EPA website states that air brea@@ thing containing ozone &apos; may reduce the employability of l@@ ung@@ s and increase the risk of suffering from res@@ pira@@ tory diseases &apos; , such as as@@ th@@ ma .

M@@ ain@@ y Gar@@ cia and V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss possible confrontation
V@@ asy@@ l L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko and M@@ ain@@ y Gar@@ cia , who should be on a col@@ lisi@@ on course to be faced with the most attractive bo@@ xing bo@@ xing in the near future of up to 6@@ 6.@@ 7 kg , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in the office of ES@@ P@@ N in L@@ OS An@@ ge@@ les separately , until Gar@@ cia , the defe@@ ated World Bo@@ Heritage Coun@@ c@@ il ath@@ r@@ on , wal@@ ked the other end of the corridor in order to welcome L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t , the World Trade Organisation Payment z@@ ation@@ i sul@@ g@@ amb@@ ts@@ ch .
following the unanimous decision of Gar@@ cia , the victory of the former four @-@ fold world champi@@ ons , Adri@@ en B@@ ron@@ er , on Saturday , in S@@ ho@@ w@@ pes , are both on the front page of the ranking .
Gar@@ cia extended her better hand and said , &apos; W@@ hen will it go , how will it go ?
I wish you well . &quot;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko protects its bel@@ ts with Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ ja on Saturday evening at 19 ES@@ P@@ N sites .
when a couple of pho@@ tos appeared , L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko mÃ¤@@ ne@@ j@@ er E@@ gis Climate stated that a possible confrontation between comb@@ at@@ ants would be a &apos; perfect measure &apos; .
&apos;@@ I am a former sul@@ ts@@ man &apos; , &apos; recalled Gar@@ cia .
&apos;@@ I stood up for B@@ ron@@ ger &#91; 6@@ 3.5 kg &#93; , but I am not so big .
I am small for 6@@ 3.5 kg .
I want to move down@@ wards .
and it has to move up@@ wards of the fri@@ vol@@ ous &#91; 6@@ 1.2 kg &#93; , and then we can fight .
F@@ ans have called for this .
so let us put it to them . &quot;
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko agreed .
&quot; the world needs this fight . &quot;
the climate raised the question of whether it should be worthwhile looking at it ; it is part of his strategy that he wants to allow L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ l to debate 6@@ 1.2 kg of class later this year in order to make it possible for a meeting with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 no@@ remo@@ ti ) next summer , who also has an interest in combating Jor@@ ge L@@ in@@ are@@ se and Lu@@ ke Cam@@ p@@ bel@@ li &apos;s match after their fri@@ weight in Ford on 23 September .
&quot; looking at this fight could be worthwhile because the f@@ ans have called for this confrontation , &quot; said Gar@@ cia , later on , that he was open to fighting any channel offering the best financial package .
&quot; we are the main actors .
no other name can get so much attention .
whenever they are ready ... &apos;
Mrs Gar@@ cia said that she regards L@@ oma@@ ch@@ en@@ ko@@ t as a &apos; force figh@@ ter &apos; and she may go to her des@@ k day .
however , L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko was hu@@ mble in pra@@ ising Gar@@ cia , saying that he thought the champion of the three di@@ vis@@ u@@ als from Ri@@ ver@@ side was &apos; very slow &apos; ; sorry , M@@ ain@@ y ... you wanted that no@@ x@@ ty &apos; .
according to Gar@@ cia , the aim was to show strength and then to bo@@ w down .
both confirmed that they felt the tension is growing in order to meet them .
&quot; this is a struggle that remains to be realised .
no other confrontation aro@@ uses so much attention and noise .
I am more than willing to work towards this , &quot; said Gar@@ cia .
L@@ oma@@ ch@@ enko said , &apos; I have been waiting for the best fighters , and M@@ ain@@ y is precisely that .
this will be a good fight . &quot;
which parts of the world are going to move to Estonia ?
last year , the police and border control authorities ( PP@@ A ) granted a record number of more than 13 000 residence permits to third @-@ country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia to work , study or family .
when , for example , last year , a fixed @-@ term residence permit was decided to be issued to 6@@ 7@@ 02 foreign nationals , the figure was 4@@ 9@@ 28 .
the offices cannot say how many migrants will ultimately remain permanently in Estonia , but this analysis will be carried out in the Ministry of the Interior .
when , ten years ago , nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a year , in recent years , this figure is beginning to close to 2000 .
the number of applicants for residence permits increased expon@@ enti@@ ally during the Ukrainian crisis , with 10@@ 87 people receiving a fixed @-@ term residence permit in 2014 , up from 6@@ 75 in the previous year .
according to the statistical office , the highest number of Ukrainian citizens is growing in Estonia : last year , 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia were more than left .
&quot; the Ukrainian community has always been large in Estonia , and it is natural , due to the difficult circumstances in the country , that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many others are already looking before the family , &quot; said Chris@@ tin Ram@@ mus , the spokes@@ person at the Ministry of the Interior .
in writing . - ( PT ) The number of Ukrainians authorised to reside on a fixed @-@ term basis was even higher than the number of Russian citizens , even though in 10 years the total number of fixed @-@ term residence permits have been granted to the latter .
if Ukrainians come here largely to work , Russian citizens will be on account of family migration .
&quot; considering the historical Russian community here , they are also most likely to have the most family ties with people living in Russia , &quot; the migrant theat@@ re of the Internal Guard , Hel@@ ina Me@@ use , said .
&apos;@@ I@@ f you look at where Russian citizens who have been granted residence in Estonia have moved , after Har@@ y@@ ana there is an Eastern Vir@@ u@@ Country &apos; , he added and pointed out that around 40 % of them were hel@@ ple@@ ss with European Union citizens .
soil was authorised for a fixed @-@ term residence of 16@@ 96 Russian citizens , which is also a record number .
at the same time , the number of Russians seeking residence permits decreased .
&quot; Hy@@ pe is due to the fact that instead of extending the residence permit , a new residence permit has been requested for permanent residence in Estonia , &quot; commented Ram@@ mus , the Ministry of the Interior press officer , who said that the interest of Russian citizens in Estonia &apos;s residence permit has remained rather stable for years .
a new residence permit for Estonia will be able to apply for foreign nationals who have lived here for at least three years from last year .
it aims to encourage the re@@ aring of those who have been adapted .
however , a long @-@ term residence permit requires , for example , five years .
the extension of the old residence permit has obviously also decreased because of the new residence permit .
for example , soil was granted such a residence permit to 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years .
Ukrainians can now change their jobs , and the Estonian state will not stop pointing the finger at whether the pay criterion has been met .
this residence permit became popular in the gar@@ den - the propri@@ et@@ ors of the bad &apos;s passport ( 10@@ 29 ) , the Russians ( 4@@ 87 ) , the Indi@@ ans ( 54 ) and the young ( 36 ) .
in total , 19@@ 68 people were granted residence permits in Estonia for accommodation purposes , including 23 Americans , 12 Egypti@@ ans , 18 Georgi@@ ans and the same number of Chinese .
the first half of this year already has a total of 12@@ 69 such applicants .
in ten years , Nigeria has become stran@@ gely a country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for residence permits in Estonia .
when three residence permits were issued to the so @-@ called &apos; gay &apos; in 2007 , there were 200 last year .
students from Nigeria are coming to study here .
in addition , higher education institutions in Estonia are popular , for example , among Georgi@@ ans , the Chinese and the Tur@@ ks .
the number of citizens of India , Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased largely thanks to the learning games .
they , too , are governed by the rule that wherever the community has come into existence , there will be easier others . &quot;
in 10 years , two people have also moved to Estonia from North Korea , for example , to La@@ os and Madagascar .
ten people have come here from Cuba , 2@@ 31 from South Korea , 40 from Indonesia and four from U@@ ru@@ guay .
if around 6,@@ 000 third @-@ country nationals receive a residence permit a year , that is around 0.@@ 46 % of the total population .
even if we add to the citizens of the European Union , migration remains at around a percentage , &quot; the Ma@@ in commented that the figures are actually small .
a total of 14@@ ,@@ 8@@ 22 people travelled to Estonia , according to the statistics office , out of 13 7@@ 92 .
this means that immigration has exceeded emigration for another year .
the majority of those who move are Estonian citizens , but more are out there .
that is why Estonia &apos;s citizens &apos; migration balance was in a mine of 2 000 people .
Est@@ oni@@ ans , in particular , mig@@ rate between Finland and Estonia .
M@@ ammu C@@ ou@@ ture printing has won with hundreds , chic@@ k@@ ens and swe@@ et .
in the north @-@ west , however , Maria Tam@@ me@@ or@@ u has a history - old pa@@ int@@ ings and defen@@ dants : &apos; I can dream of somewhere in the muse@@ um for hours and ad@@ m@@ ire the thi@@ ev@@ es and cra@@ cks of old times .
if you take the lead with your stone , you will study and learn about it every day .
that is a pleasure to find out .
the M@@ ammu C@@ ou@@ ture gla@@ mo@@ ther@@ ne world may seem to some in life , but the de@@ sig@@ ner does not think so .
you yourselves decide how much you can spend in your life !
as a friend , I have a whole s@@ now full of the shar@@ ks I have created .
because it is not his fault that he does not live in Hol@@ ly@@ wood and does not go on red wh@@ eel@@ s every day ; he also wants to wear those most beautiful bro@@ kers , and that is what is suffering !
you can live your own life special !
the mobile ar@@ tist does not recognise the Gulf between sh@@ ining events and grey archa@@ e@@ der Day .
it is this reasoning that led to plans to move higher education to places in Estonia , between forests and fields , to people who often do not get anywhere .
M@@ ammu colle@@ c@@ tus was presented , for example , in comparison , J@@ evening and ice at the mo@@ e@@ alle@@ l , where 45 mo@@ del@@ li Ro@@ yal de@@ fi@@ les filled a whole street .
in Tallinn , you are often taken in the shop , you are no@@ d@@ ding with dignity , but there are more emo@@ tions elsewhere - cri@@ es b@@ ra@@ vo , you stand up , you want to thank you .
a large proportion of the public came out of po@@ cket , but now they are M@@ ou@@ ture f@@ ans .
if you exceed the expectations of the people , they will be very spiri@@ ted !
and I like the feeling that I am with my mo@@ vi@@ o@@ tive like the summer .
Per@@ nus had a 50 @-@ me@@ tre red car@@ pet , a whole street full of bro@@ thers , seemed to have come to an end !
she also does not recognise the fashi@@ on@@ able practice that creation must be presented by super @-@ super@@ mode@@ ll , she is happy to bring ordinary women to the ground .
I often call on my own customers - they have always come with pleasure .
after all , this la@@ isse@@ z @-@ fa@@ ire experience , you got a wonderful cli@@ mb@@ o on the ben@@ ch stage !
I am so sorry that I have never seen my own performance , and I am always behind the scene to give the final meat to things as a hope@@ less per@@ phe@@ cy .
my ner@@ v@@ ous would not allow calm on the floor .
Maria is this kind of j@@ arg@@ on who wants not only to play a representative role but to be involved in everything .
I have my sis@@ ter machine in the session , and I myself carry out most of the colle@@ ctions .
I like the whole process in which you play with the details you find yourself .
I am never far from my own creation and I am not afraid of work .
the substance is not limited , nor is it sti@@ r@@ gy , logistics , organisation , organisation - everyone has to ju@@ mp away from one of the sta@@ tic women &apos;s days .
the fana@@ tics still have a huge amount of work to do .
I cannot say when my day ends , for me , this is simply a day of joy !
I am still very lu@@ cky - it is like an un@@ failing mountain of happ@@ iness : I do something beautiful , someone gets something nice and there are compli@@ ments .
it has been said many times that in my bro@@ thers , there is a physi@@ c@@ ist - they make themselves felt like a pr@@ inc@@ ess .
the generous scen@@ es that made Mrs Maria talent famous overnight have sta@@ yed the M@@ ammu C@@ ou@@ ture sign@@ alling to this day .
Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ pp of U@@ 18 boys : the weapon of the pro @-@ Afghan Cap@@ tain has now been turned against us .
I am sorry , the fa@@ iry tale ran out .
the first thing was that we did not get our feet .
and if there is such a gap on Saturday , there is nothing to do , &quot; Estonia commented on U@@ 18 Cor@@ v@@ pal@@ li@@ cal 61 : 75 absten@@ tions in Britain in our only bas@@ ket@@ ball , BC Kal@@ e@@ v / Cra@@ mo ab@@ it@@ re@@ en@@ er Martin M@@ y@@ r@@ sel .
opponents of the wave attacked 28 pla@@ tes and suffered so much more attacks as a result .
nor was we prepared for their aggressive defence or attack ; it created it .
many British attacks ended in three to five seconds , we were unable to build up protection .
in defence , however , they were able to keep their hands everywhere ; we were unable to combine .
it has left the team on its feet .
the ho@@ mework of the opponents was better done .
M@@ y@@ r@@ se@@ pa estimates that Estonia should have made more tac@@ tical mistakes in order to take off the momentum in the b@@ ud .
last but not least , we had a zero error , but the opponents have already received several quick cor@@ ners .
In@@ tran@@ sig@@ ence and intense insistence , which was our weapon on the al@@ ag@@ r@@ ho@@ p , all turned against us now .
today we did not have the strength against their agg@@ ressi@@ veness .
the flag remained satisfied with its ca@@ rele@@ ss@@ ness in Kal@@ ev@@ is , Mat@@ th@@ ias T@@ as@@ s .
in general , tourism can say fine words about the whole team , and until now there has been a united blow .
it is a pity that such aggressive responses had not been met in the past .
T@@ as@@ s has always been self @-@ confident and played out today , but he seemed ti@@ red - he has borne quite a heavy burden .
but he made some quite nice moves , which I have seen in the past as tr@@ en@@ ches , in addition to the guide . &quot;
terrible figures : the cor@@ v@@ pal@@ li@@ tan@@ y of ne@@ sia thre@@ w less than 10 points on E@@ M @-@ tur@@ ni@@ l with three quarters ...
the eigh@@ teen age class does not apply only to H@@ .@@ B @-@ di@@ vis@@ j@@ on Kor@@ v@@ pal@@ li@@ tur@@ ni@@ ir in Tallinn , she started the day before yesterday in Dublin .
and , unfortunately , Estonia &apos;s ga@@ mble with Poland bo@@ wed down to anti@@ re@@ cor@@ ners .
Estonia lost 25 : 65 , but still after the third quarter , it was 9 : 49 , or only at the last ten minutes , the opponents took their feet from the gas beet , and the period remained 16 : 16 .
on both the first and the second quarter Estonia had 4 , third point ...
in so doing , in the first two minutes , the Est@@ oni@@ ans hit two pieces of the first four pieces , going on to play 25 pieces , then one in three , and then another 21 te@@ ars in the ...
perhaps in almost half an hour , 47 fin@@ gers were caught .
in addition , 2 points came from four la@@ yers .
there was a reasonable number of losses at that time , 12 .
at the end of the game , Poland &apos;s compliance rate was 33 % and Estonia had 13 % ( 68 / 9 ) .
Estonia has started two losses , and on the opening day Portugal had 83 : 56 better .
NATO vessels came to Tallinn to supplement the stock
today , NATO &apos;s 1 permanent anti @-@ personnel group arrived in Tallinn for a weekend in order to complement the stock@@ pi@@ les of vessels and prepare for pre @-@ existing exercises .
during the visit , ships are preparing for the accommodation of the seas , thereby giving cre@@ ws the opportunity to break daily leave .
after the visit , NATO vessels will remain in Estonia &apos;s waters in order to carry out a number of exercises and be ready for future historical bom@@ b@@ ings .
&apos;@@ The participation of Est@@ oni@@ ans in the NATO entity and the joint courses of action they carry out in local waters illustrates our integration with alli@@ ed forces &apos; , says the bri@@ gade Ar@@ ten@@ es@@ to Rein@@ land , the head of the operation and planning department in the vic@@ inity of the naval flo@@ til@@ la .
since 29 June , NATO will host a permanent anti @-@ personnel group 1 led by the Latvian Na@@ vy Cap@@ ten@@ ant G@@ vi@@ do Lau@@ du@@ ps , who took over from Estonia &apos;s naval officers , Joh@@ an @-@ E@@ li@@ as , at a ceremony in Riga .
the group &apos;s flag vessels are assigned the Latvian naval support vessel L@@ V@@ N@@ S Vir@@ sa@@ itis , which also has a steering seat of a group .
during this semester , the Estonian Na@@ vy &apos;s mine hun@@ t is also part of the international conting@@ ent .
as one of the four groups of NATO &apos;s naval management personnel , NATO &apos;s 1 permanent mine group is the first rapid response unit , which the alliance can send within five days to different parts of the world .
between 4 and 13 August , the ancient ru@@ ins of the P@@ iri@@ ta mon@@ as@@ tery will once again become a place where the children of Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val , who was born 13 years ago by Ma@@ es@@ tro E@@ ri , will be detained .

Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val has much more than just concer@@ ts and theat@@ res .
it is larger than any mus@@ cle theat@@ re in its normal form .
it is a festi@@ val whose s@@ now takes hold and never gets rid of .
because the experience that the lis@@ ten@@ er receives in this sup@@ erior and my@@ ste@@ rious environment makes human spiri@@ ts more generous and concerns human qualities in a way that cannot be described .
at risk , you are the art leader of Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val for the first year .
did the sho@@ es of the Ma@@ es@@ tro E@@ ri K@@ las@@ s not feel a little big ?
of course , but since I had a very personal relationship with E@@ ri Klaus , it has been very helpful .
she pushed me across my entire school@@ ing career and also supported the start of the adjustment career .
perhaps it is thanks to this that it will be easier for me to continue his work .
in K@@ las , the team of Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val has been so much b@@ ent and , of course , all of this is passed on to me .
it was excellent to join a team that knows exactly how things are going .
it was the great heart of E@@ ri K@@ esti@@ val that gave me the strength to move forward with Bir@@ git@@ ta F@@ esti@@ val in Tallinn .
and here I am and I can do it !
what could audience this year at the F@@ esti@@ val , what are you offering in particular ?
we have the artists in England , Latvia , Lithuania and , by the way , the first bal@@ le@@ tt written on Astrid L@@ ind@@ gren &apos;s speech comes as a surprise .

new results of the age assessment tests for asylum seekers in Sweden were published
in Sweden , asylum seekers were selected for a medical assessment of their age with a novel approach , and the latest results of the test show that more than 80 % of the constitu@@ tions were assessed as older than 18 , but not all of them believe in the accuracy of the results .
the Swedish National Institute for Legal medicine ( R@@ LO@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ ver@@ ket ) started the tests later this year .
the tests were set up to make a more accurate assessment of age during the asylum application following criticism of the Swedish migration agency ( migration amb@@ s@@ ver@@ ket ) for failing to correctly determine the age of many allegedly under@@ age refugees .
to date , migration manages to send 68 80 cases to the test and the Institute of Justice has issued a total of 24@@ 81 tests between mid @-@ March 2017 and 31 July .
Eigh@@ ty per cent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 @-@ year @-@ old or older , and 25 more cases were assessed by the Institute of Legal medicine that the trial &apos; may be 18 @-@ year old or older &apos; .
in 4@@ 32 cases , it was concluded that man is &apos; probably younger than 18 &apos; .
tests will only be used if people &apos;s age is called into question .
according to John GÃ¶@@ Franc@@ son , who works in the Institute of Justice , the results are consistent with those of the past months .
&quot; we do not see much difference between the statistics of the past months ; the figures are quite consistent , &quot; he said to The Local .
the fact that a large proportion of cases were assessed as older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have left their age .
the Institute issued the results of the 581 test in May and stated that , in 4@@ 42 cases , &apos; there are indications that the person under investigation is 18 or older &apos; .
however , when the newspaper Svensson Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the results of their 581 test , it turned out that in 2@@ 43 cases , one had declared directly that it would be 18 this year .
this method of medical age assessment , in which smart co@@ ck@@ ta@@ ils from X @-@ ray and field MR@@ I are then allowed to be analysed by den@@ tists and radi@@ olo@@ gis@@ ts , has been criticised in some quarters .
one of the sceptics is the endo@@ k@@ rin@@ ology of the K@@ aro@@ lin@@ ska Institute , Mr Claude Mar@@ cus , whose tasks include assessing people &apos;s biological maturity in order to find out whether they were going through the audience sooner or later than usual .
&quot; I have had reason to think about this and I do not think that the measurement currently used should be used .
the establishment of biological age in this way is highly uncertain .
if we cannot say for sure , we should not pretend that we can , &apos; he said forestry to history .
but Joh@@ an GÃ¶@@ Franc@@ son , the Institute of Justice , defended the accuracy of the tests : &apos; in general , it can be said that there is little risk of dis@@ soci@@ ating a child in@@ accurately into adul@@ th@@ ood .
perhaps the biggest figure of around 10 % is the risk if you are a little under 18 . &quot;

the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Kyoto figh@@ ter Anna Maria O@@ rel put the London M@@ il in a nice debate , getting a good 18 seat with 6@@ 7.@@ 3@@ 07 .
after that , M@@ M no@@ ori@@ m was a female bis@@ cu@@ mb , and a happy woman confirmed that he hopes to fight for the med@@ als in the future .
the contest went well and gained good experience .
with the first test ( 6@@ 4.@@ 80 ) , I immediately took up my average result , while in the second ( 6@@ 2.@@ 80 ) I ris@@ ked too much , and in the third ( 6@@ 7.@@ 37 ) I was able to keep it clear , &quot; said then after the competition .
I have been looking for my emissions and I am very pleased that I have found it .
Anna Maria O@@ re@@ li M@@ M &apos;s debate ended with a good 18 seats .

everyone says that it gives more - that is !
if you compete yourself , you can experience it .
after all , it was confirmed that there would be a lot of satisfaction with the M@@ M debate and he still has many good competitions ahead of him : &apos; I came here with the 3@@ 2nd or final result of this year &apos;s season , I ended in 18@@ th .
that is a very good result .
I am 20 years old and I - that is the only thing that matters .
I take on board a good experience , and on a few days I want to compete on behalf of the med@@ als .
Western Vir@@ g@@ ina govern@@ ber announced party change
West Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a democratic govern@@ or , Jim Justice , announced on a Thursday evening with President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ er that he would change political parties .
&apos;@@ W@@ h@@ y it or not , the democrats ble@@ ed away from me , &apos; said Governor Justice .
&apos;@@ Today I say to you , having stood up and thought ... today , I will tell you , the Western Ty@@ re , that I can no longer help you as a democratic Governor &apos; .
during the round , the tri@@ cks were filled with joy .
&quot; so I will be Re@@ publi@@ can tomorrow , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; as a engine@@ er , I would say to you that it is time to play a different game . &quot;
the T@@ ru@@ mp had previously promised a major announcement at the gathering of Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
the T@@ ru@@ mp won in Western Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ as with 42 points , and Justice did not support the Democrat candidate , H@@ ill@@ ary Clin@@ ton .
Justice , which according to For@@ mer@@ i , is the only bil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e in the state , proved to be elected in 2016 .
For@@ k@@ ness notes that it has coal mines in five states and a coal business in its own right .
its value is close to USD 1.@@ 59 billion .
at the same time , the Re@@ publi@@ can National Committee ( R@@ N@@ C ) published on Thursday evening stating that &apos; Governor Justice &apos;s party change is another blow to the democratic party , which would rather prevent the country from being made better again than would work for it &apos; .
&apos;@@ The only 15 months old and control over the least numerous states in history : the announcement by Governor Justice is simply the most recent wake @-@ up call to the par@@ ade , which runs from the very end and is unable to find a positive and united message , &apos; said R@@ N@@ C representation R@@ on@@ na Mc@@ died in the C@@ B@@ S New@@ si Statement .

Co@@ e praised fair apolo@@ gy to Russians for D@@ oping F@@ air
the international r@@ hy@@ th@@ m S@@ ebas@@ tian Co@@ e , who said that &apos; Russia &apos;s four @-@ day fair apolo@@ gy &apos; for the doping scandal , reiterated that this is not the time to allow sport back to the country .
at the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World C@@ up , Russia &apos;s ligh@@ t@@ we@@ ights , D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ stop@@ h@@ tin said that the ban on competitions imposed on her country is the right one and has a definite aim to combat doping .
he apolog@@ ised &apos; to all fri@@ vol@@ ous classes that have been s@@ nat@@ ched away in the competitions in the fields of gold and sil@@ ver me@@ als &apos; .
despite his comments , IA@@ AF Congress voted to maintain the entry into force of the competition ban introduced in November 2015 after the W@@ AD@@ A report found evidence of state @-@ spon@@ sored doping in Russia .
&quot; I think it was a very honest answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Costa to journalists .
&quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Permanent Union itself recognised that they had rather difficult times and that they would do their utmost to reform the Union . &quot;
furthermore , according to Co@@ e , it was pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its own recovery .
&quot; I believe that today has been a very constructive day and progress is being made , but Congress supports the group &apos;s proposal that this is not the time to withdraw Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we must do everything possible in the next few months to norm@@ alise the situation .
we have always been guided by the principle that we want to separate free spor@@ ts@@ people from a damaged system , &quot; he added .
N@@ in@@ th Russian fri@@ vol@@ er who meets strict criteria of IA@@ AF will compete as neutral ath@@ le@@ tes in the light of World C@@ up in London on Friday .
the head of the IA@@ AF Working Group , R@@ une Andersson , said on Monday that Russia is not yet meeting a number of criteria for forecas@@ ting .
after a presentation to IA@@ AF Council , he told journalists in London that doping control is still insufficient and that training engineers who are banned are still operating freely .
the electric car revolution is making a significant difference to the demand for metals .
who are the winners and losers ?
not only does the electricity car revolution change significantly everything from the fuel market to infrastructure , but it also creates new winners and losers in the me@@ tal market .
although mining gi@@ ants like G@@ len@@ core can say that one place will win and the other will lose out , it will not help smaller mining firms .
today G@@ len@@ core coal and oil serve , but in the future , the demand for co@@ balt , li@@ thi@@ um , cop@@ per , alu@@ mini@@ um and nic@@ ot@@ ine will increase in the age of electric cars .
this year , the UK , France and Norway governments have contributed to the proliferation of electric cars , allowing fossil fuel cars to be banned in the coming decades .
Vol@@ vo has therefore already known that he is planning to abandon his combustion engine and T@@ es@@ la will bring a cheaper winter 3 electric cars onto the market .
B@@ iz@@ berg New Energy Finance predi@@ cts that over two decades more electric cars will be sold than cars using oil .
&apos;@@ For some metals this al@@ ters everything &apos; , the Capital Economics Economics raw material analy@@ sts Sim@@ ona G@@ amb@@ ran@@ in to B@@ oli@@ ber@@ i said .
we have already seen a major impact on metals such as co@@ balt and li@@ thi@@ um , which have been growing in demand for years .
in electric cars there are approximately three times as many answers as in the conventional car , the G@@ len@@ core report .
even more answers are needed at charging stations , which is why Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris estimates that it will increase cop@@ per demand by around 5 % by 2025 .
an increase in demand for electric cars means further demand for li@@ thi@@ um , co@@ balt , gra@@ p@@ hite and tun@@ g@@ sters .
G@@ len@@ core will benefit from an increasing trend in electric cars from an increase in cop@@ per prices and from being the world &apos;s largest co@@ balt producer , the forecast J@@ eff@@ eff@@ inning Group .
this bro@@ ker company estimates that other winning electric cars will be won by F@@ res@@ sell @-@ Mc@@ Mo@@ R@@ an and First Qu@@ an@@ tum Min@@ er@@ als .
the market reac@@ ts to an already changing trend .
this year , 70 % of metal@@ lic stock co@@ ded in London .
the increase in soil prices was 37 % .
the answer has also grown by 14 % this year , mainly due to economic growth .
G@@ len@@ core Bank shares rose by 20 % in London , having sur@@ passed the price increase to the ri@@ val Rio T@@ in , B@@ H@@ P Bil@@ lit@@ on and Ang@@ lo Caribbean .
on the side of the losers , there are lead companies , such as Rec@@ y@@ cle@@ x and Cam@@ p@@ ine , which have to adapt to the new era .
the main end @-@ use of the gas is the bat@@ teries supplying the flow of petrol and diesel @-@ powered cars .
electric cars use li@@ iti@@ u@@ lation bat@@ teries .
&quot; this is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found for any other purpose that can overcome the fall in demand , &quot; Michael W@@ id@@ mer , the producer of America , the chairman of the Me@@ tal Market for Mer@@ ri@@ ll Lyn@@ chi , said .
there is still no evidence of the impact of the d@@ wind@@ ling trend in the form of a ping price movement .
the p@@ ound has been fishing at 17 % this year , which is the best me@@ tal in London for the main industrial metals .
investors will only see problems on me@@ tal in the long term .
&apos;@@ I am not sure that leads will be so bad because cheap oil will hold conventional cars in competition &apos; , Her@@ wi@@ g Schmidt , the head of Tri@@ land Me@@ tal@@ s , said .
if lead demand falls , it will slow .
perhaps that will be the case in about ten years &apos; time .
however , in the meantime , stricter emissions standards mean that demand for hybrid cars , which are heavily dependent on lead @-@ based bat@@ teries for the launch of engines , is being evaluated by the International Organisation for lead and Industry .
L@@ ung metals like alu@@ mini@@ um replace steel as a light car can go further with less electricity .
this explains the additional fixed minimum demand of 1.6 million tonnes between 2013 and 2016 .
this represents 2.7 % of the world &apos;s GDP for alu@@ mini@@ um .
this trend is likely to wor@@ sen , says W@@ id@@ mer .
A@@ lu@@ mini@@ um has been fishing for 13 % this year , as the growing demand by car manufacturers has led to a market deficit .
steel producers will not .
ak S@@ rada holding works with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce wonderful car@@ tels .
Ar@@ cel@@ or@@ Mit@@ tal and ash S@@ road@@ Europe are also trying to develop a ligh@@ ter mel@@ ting area from steel in order to counter the minimum .
&apos;@@ The strong steel should be the answer to this development &apos; , says the Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris analysis , Syl@@ vain Br@@ un@@ et .
there is some progress in Europe .
the end of the oil era can also bring suffering to the pla@@ tin@@ um .
soil took around half of this precious me@@ tal diesel engine as a catalyst for cars , Joh@@ n@@ son Mat@@ they announced .
&quot; many raw materials currently high demand , such as oil and pos@@ ters , may not face high demand in the future , &quot; said Bernard D@@ ah@@ da@@ h , the Na@@ ti@@ x@@ is raw materials analy@@ st .
this does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important , but their importance will change over 15 years .
Pla@@ to@@ in@@ ate producers believe in continued demand for diesel hybrid cars .
Marc G@@ ry@@ n@@ berg , leader of Un@@ core , said that more hybrid cars will continue to be sold in 2025 .
in the 10 @-@ year perspective , the great hope of the Pla@@ tin@@ an producers is on hydrogen @-@ based cars developed by To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Motors and Hy@@ toe@@ i Mo@@ tos , which rely on the pla@@ tin@@ um to produce electricity from hydrogen .
up to now , however , this technology has not yet been commercially justified .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at seems to be a clear losers on the road to electric cars &apos; , says Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Paris from Br@@ un@@ et .
German car manufacturers suffered a major set@@ back in July because the S@@ tut@@ t@@ g@@ art Court banned diesel in the town of Mercedes @-@ Ben@@ z and Por@@ sch@@ e .
how the financial rules for football affect the migration of Ney@@ ra to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing the un@@ bri@@ dled spending of European football clubs do not prevent the world record transition of Ney@@ ra from the Spanish football club in Barcelona to Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequence from UEFA , the steering Board , which domin@@ ates the European game and has the power to prohibit teams from participating in the pres@@ ti@@ gious League of Maritime Ministers &apos; movement , lies ahead of Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ th .
the financial rules for fair play ( F@@ F@@ P ) introduced by UEFA in 2011 will mean that the PS@@ G will have to demonstrate at some point that the tak@@ e@@ over of Ney@@ ra was financed without huge damage .
Barcelona received â¬ 2@@ 22 million ( $ 2@@ 62 million ) only to buy the Brazili@@ ans out of his contract , and the remuneration of Ney@@ ra will reach tens of millions of dollars a year .
there are some financial aspects of the integration of Ney@@ ra into the French club .
PS@@ G will undoubtedly be able to pick up this money to recruit Ney@@ ra and add its sta@@ rs to the band@@ it@@ ous ri@@ g , given that the team is funded by the governing family of the Q@@ a@@ tar energy bank .
clubs are allowed to spend a great deal on recru@@ iting players , but they must balance this with legal sources of income that enable them to come out of a football club .
F@@ F@@ F@@ P was set up by Michel Pla@@ tini after being elected President of UEFA in 2007 .
this former French player believed that clubs that fall into big debt in search of success are actually fraudulent and run the risk of ruin if banks or owners are to give up support .
from 2011 , F@@ F@@ P will focus on monitoring these losses instead of the debt of clubs .
this change means that the business model used by Ro@@ man Ab@@ ra@@ mo@@ vi@@ ch first in 2003 in C@@ hel@@ sea - buying a club with potential and then making huge costs in order to improve the team and create a global brand - is harder to implement .
F@@ F@@ P during the current three @-@ year evaluation period , which runs until 2018 , clubs may suffer losses of up to â¬ 30 million .
and despite the shame@@ less exclusion of Pla@@ tini from the presidential office in 2015 , his successor , Alexander C@@ ef@@ er@@ in , remains committed to preventing excessive spending .
&quot; F@@ F@@ P is certainly not dead and we will no doubt continue to strengthen these rules , &quot; said last week The infected P@@ ope Andre@@ a Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is the guardian of UEFA @-@ F@@ P .
although PS@@ G paid for the Ney@@ ra over@@ purchase clause as a single integrated payment , they will be able to distribute this amount for accounting purposes for the entire duration of the contract .
Ney@@ mar signed a five @-@ year agreement , which is why it will be possible to show a transitional fee of EUR 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million over the next five years .
for the first wave of F@@ F@@ P sanctions in 2014 , the PS@@ G , together with Abu D@@ ha@@ bi Manch@@ ester C@@ it@@ y@@ ga , received the most severe penalties .
a fine of EUR 60 million was imposed on the PS@@ G ( currently USD 82 million ) , which was then reduced to EUR 20 million , and a club was called for to limit the crew of the League of Ministers during the season 2014 @-@ 2015 to 21 players instead of business as usual .
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to ro@@ ck over the financial institutions by ex@@ posing their incomes to businesses linked to owners .
the K@@ tar company may spon@@ sor the PS@@ G , but if the value of spon@@ sorship is deemed to be above standard market rates , UEFA would not allow it to be taken into account as official income .
this was the case in 2014 , when UEFA decided that Q@@ a@@ tar tourism Authority ( PS@@ G ) support was worth blow@@ ing up .
it has been said that a certain part of the Ney@@ ra PS@@ G service may come from Ka@@ infrastructure through payments from the World C@@ up Management Committee for 20@@ 22 .
however , the PS@@ G and Q@@ a@@ tar 20@@ 22 deny that Ney@@ ra could become a member of the World C@@ up and claim that UEFA &apos;s regulatory authorities could easily reveal this manoeuvre .
the penalties previously imposed on the PS@@ G mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in any attempt to ignore the rules .
people familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not been proactive in discussing the transition to PS@@ G Ney@@ ra .
they spoke with The dant on condition that their anon@@ y@@ mity is guaranteed , as they are not allowed to discuss the situation in the PS@@ G .
the latest reports show that more than â¬ 10 million in profits from the PS@@ G during the 2015 @-@ 2016 season are worth around â¬ 54@@ 2.4 million .
data for the last financial year have not yet been published .
PS@@ G hopes that the arrival of Ney@@ ra will have an impact on spon@@ sorship transactions , trade and distribution .
the club expects at least a 30 % increase in turnover in connection with the conclusion of the contract .
Spain too , clearly anno@@ yed by the departure of one of the largest football sta@@ rs , sought to hinder the transition to Ney@@ ra , claiming that PS@@ G is in breach of F@@ P .
&quot; this is a clear case of &quot; financial doping &quot; with clubs and country , &quot; said La ga President Javier T@@ eb@@ as to Spanish newspaper AS , indicating that the PS@@ G is mainly in Ka@@ tar .
Ar@@ ci W@@ en@@ ger , Ar@@ sen@@ al hill and club members of the American sporting mag@@ na@@ te , shares the view that the state finances the club .
&quot; that is the result of ownership rights and it has changed the whole football landscape completely over the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ en@@ ger on Thursday .
&quot; if the club is a state , it is all possible .
it is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play as a country may have other ways or other interests to represent such a big player . &quot;

the hur@@ ric@@ ane mentioned for the century , which ra@@ ged on 6 and 7 August , caused severe damage , particularly to the West , Har@@ u@@ lin and Rap@@ la@@ Country .
in the north @-@ west of Estonia , the wind was over 30 m / s during these days .

&apos;@@ It is an incredible amount &apos; , marking U@@ so@@ v .
the second big category is municipal waste , or all that people leave behind .
there are eight large @-@ scale rub@@ b@@ ish mines on a one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ kilometre coastal region in S@@ tro@@ om , which need to be emp@@ tied three times a week .
so much is created by rub@@ b@@ ish .
however , cold summer weather has meant that rub@@ b@@ ish is one fifth less than otherwise .
the third species comprises abandoned objects .
for the most part , these are cargo flights .
as this harvest , ten ag@@ glom@@ er@@ ations of the slu@@ dge have pul@@ led out of U@@ so@@ v &apos;s sand .
they will await the owners on a tra@@ il route .
&apos;@@ normally they are coming out more , but this is normal harvest &apos; . she knows that she will soon find them back in the sand .

Erika Sch@@ ol@@ ler , the representative of the management services in the hospital , conce@@ des that the work of the tra@@ ctor distur@@ bs local communities .
noise , which runs from night to night , is disrup@@ ting the lives of the people living in the neighbourhood .
on the day , however , this work is impossible .
one month has to go through the army twice .
&apos;@@ I@@ f we do not do this , the urban section will fine us &apos; , Mr Sch@@ ol@@ ler notes .
however , like P@@ iri@@ ta , P@@ ik@@ ak@@ ari and Enlargement , the aim is also to bring S@@ tro@@ om rand to the top quality of the international flag .
&quot; much more work is needed in Estonia than in Europe to ensure that be@@ aches are maintained , &quot; says Sch@@ ol@@ ler .
we have more cl@@ ot@@ h and more stone and harder to live in the sand .
on our be@@ aches , however , there is less rub@@ b@@ ish than in other parts of Europe .
when I hear that there is talk of waste on the be@@ ach , Mr Martin , living near S@@ tro@@ om be@@ aches , is moving round a circle of journalists and cor@@ ro@@ bor@@ ation workers , highlighting the current weaknesses .
there is a picture of the gallery every day of tomorrow .
the problem is birds and pu@@ p@@ pet sla@@ ves who have pul@@ led rub@@ b@@ ish bags &apos; , Mr Martin says .
although it is difficult to assume that people can change their behaviour to date , Martin hopes that the urban government will do something about the waste b@@ in and will impose on them , for example , ca@@ f@@ es , to prevent them from at least in the cities there from news .
overall , however , Martin is pleased with the development of the S@@ tro@@ om be@@ ach .
we can see that the city is taking care of this .
it has become more pleasant with children &apos;s fields , lighting and newly as@@ ph@@ alt roads .
once upon a time , it was only possible to travel one way , &quot; said Martin .

Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates remain stable , as weak economic growth and debt alle@@ viation have cus@@ hi@@ oned speculation on the rise .
the Bank of England has warned that growth is still a slu@@ gg@@ ish matter , as the hard @-@ pressed incomes of households have put interest rates on hold .
the policy makers of the Bank &apos;s Monetary Policy Committee ( MP@@ C ) voted 6 : 2 percentage points to 0.@@ 25 % and fewer members demand an increase this month because slow economic growth has weakened support .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank cut its growth forecast for 2017 from 1.7 % and from 1.6 % in 2018 and warned that the pressure on households &apos; incomes would remain as inflation is still expected to rise to 3 % in the autumn .
at the same time , the Bank sign@@ alled that the rise in tariffs is necessary to contain inflation due to Bre@@ x@@ y over the next few years , and the financial markets may need to have a higher than expected increase in loan costs .
Members also voted a year ago in favour of the partial withdrawal of the ma@@ m@@ mot@@ h package , which has been launched as a result of Bre@@ x@@ t .
in February , the Bank will end up with a fixed @-@ term cash scheme that will provide cheap finance to banks , although it said that it is now expected to supply GBP 15 billion more under this scheme , which is GBP 115 billion .
in the minutes of the decision on the rate , the Bank says , &apos; gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains power@@ less in the near future as the difficult situation of real household incomes continues to have an impact on consumption &apos; .
on the rates , it was repeated that , in order to mitigate inflation , &apos; fiscal policy is required to &apos; make some effort &apos; and &apos; somewhat larger &apos; than the markets are expected .
the stock is currently forecas@@ ting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020 .
however , the Bank stressed that any ju@@ mp is gradual and limited .
the Bank &apos;s reduced growth forecasts for this year and next year are comparable to the forecasts for May at 1.9 % and 1.7 % .
the forecast of 1.8 % growth in 2018 remained stable .
after that news , the p@@ ound fell in exchange for the dollar and the euro .
it fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and 0.@@ 4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision not to make any changes is due to the recent disappointing growth figures , which have raised expectations of a rise in diesel GDP in the second quarter from 0.2 % in the last three months to 0.@@ 3 % .
the Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.@@ 3 % in the third quarter , although it will gather some momentum at the end of the year .
the Bank &apos;s most recent inflation report gave little reason to welcome rising inflation and w@@ ret@@ ched households , saying that the situation is getting a little worse before the recovery .
it was added that monetary policy could not prevent income losses in the next few years , but a significant recovery is expected towards the end of the three @-@ year forecast .
thanks to the black p@@ ound , the growing demand for British production is also stimulating the economy , which is partly off@@ setting consumers &apos; lower costs .
the decision comes one year after the level was taken last August at 0.@@ 25 % after the shocking EU referendum , which caused the sudden weakening of the p@@ ound .
the Bank estimates that it is likely to take four years to completely brea@@ the life into prices and the economy .
before the last decision of the Bank , there was a growing demand for higher rates , as inflation had increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households ; in July , three policy makers called for an increase of 0.5 % .
inflation fell last month from 2.6 % , compared to 2.9 % in June , although the bank said it was expected to rise again in the coming months .
the Bank said that excess growth compared to the 2 % target was due to the completely weak p@@ ound .
the head of the mortgage bro@@ ker in Co@@ rec@@ o , Andrew Mon@@ t@@ la@@ ke , said : &apos; in view of the recent downturn in exchange rates , it seems that the mortgage market is once again becoming increasingly competitive , as len@@ ders want to work and hope to complete the year positively .
Mr BÃ¶@@ rs seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are coming to an end , as re@@ financing , often without service and at low rates , has become increasingly popular . &quot;
10 000 people are writing out of HIV drugs that are controversial
patients will have access to &apos; trans@@ forma@@ tive &apos; HIV treatment since September , following a battle held in the Supreme Court over whether the N@@ HS should finance the medicine .
N@@ HS England announced that public health is now estimated to make 10 000 people available in the initial three @-@ year clinical trial to pre @-@ exposure pro@@ phy@@ la@@ x@@ tis ( Pr@@ EP ) - a ta@@ ble@@ t that is administered before the rec@@ ess and which has shown a reduction in the risk of infection in people at high risk by around 86 % .
the N@@ HS agreed to finance a clinical trial after the appeal court backed a ruling last year by the Supreme Court that the N@@ HS would be able to pay for Pr@@ EP , in spite of its own claims that the medicine should be financed by local authorities .
Simon Ste@@ vens , Executive Director of N@@ HS Eng@@ land , welcomed this launch unve@@ iled on Thursday as &apos; new , far @-@ reaching intervention &apos; , whereas the National AIDS Fund ( NA@@ T ) described it as a &apos; pivotal moment &apos; .
sexual health clin@@ ics in London , B@@ right ton , Manch@@ ester , Li@@ ver@@ po@@ oli@@ s and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d are among the first to register people ; in October , further clin@@ ics will follow before the programme is introduced everywhere in England by April 2018 .
pre @-@ ca@@ rec@@ t pro@@ phy@@ la@@ x@@ tis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a cu@@ p on HIV medicines that will be taken up before the rec@@ ess in order to reduce the risk of infection in HIV .
clinical trials show that Pr@@ EP significantly reduces transmission of HIV among people at risk of infection .
taking the Pr@@ EP before the rec@@ ess means that there are sufficient medicines in the body that prevent HIV infections .
these medicines can be taken every day or two hours before the rec@@ ess .
among the suitable candidates for treatment are L@@ GB@@ T men , trans@@ gender people and people with HIV @-@ infected partners .
these students will find suitable people willing to participate in clinical trials , including men , women , trans@@ gender people and those whose HIV @-@ related partner cannot receive anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral treatment .
people living in England and having chosen a family doctor will also be able to register their wish to participate in a local sexual health clin@@ ic participating in the programme .
the programme costs GBP 10 million and N@@ HS England signed an agreement to get medicines in the hands of international procurement this week .
the clinical trial aims to assess the true potential of the Pr@@ EP by gathering clinical evidence of who the medicine is intended for , and how it is consumed and applied in great cloud .
Ste@@ vens said , &apos; This new wide @-@ ranging intervention should complement and intensify the wide @-@ ranging and increasingly successful fight against HIV .
this is another milestone in more than three decades of fighting one of humanity &apos;s greatest health problems . &quot;
D@@ eb@@ or@@ ah gold , Chief Executive officer of NA@@ T , said , &apos; This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if it is properly targeted at those who need it and are in a risk @-@ prone phase , offers an opportunity to change Britain &apos;s HIV epidemic .
since September , people with high HIV risks in England , through this clinical trial funded by the N@@ HS , have access to a powerful new tool that is individually managed and does not depend on negotiations with the partner , thereby improving many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
ian Green , CE@@ O of the Ter@@ rence Higgins Fund , said : &apos; now it is essential to ensure that the clinical attempt is quickly rol@@ led out across the country and that no one belonging to HIV risk group is left behind .
now that the Pr@@ EP clinical trial has been obtained , we are on the way to protecting more than 10 000 people who are at risk of infection with HIV .
Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Minister for Public Health , said : &apos; the start of the Pr@@ EP clinical trial is very welcome and very late after months of delay and mis@@ authorisation of the feet of the government .
evidence shows how much change this drug can bring to the prevention of HIV and to an end to the spread of infection changing its life .
this clinical test takes us one step closer to full understanding of the advantages of the Pr@@ EP .
it is now important that the clinical test is deployed as soon as possible in order to protect people who have exposure to HIV and take us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
however , electricity prices rose by 12 % in Estonia , while Latvia and Lithuania fell .
the difference in electricity prices between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania fell to 1.@@ 94 euro next day , compared to â¬ 7.@@ 71 in June this year , announced the round .
the main reason for the difference in prices is the rich links between Lithuania and Sweden .
in Estonia , the average wholesale electricity price was set at â¬ 34.@@ 33 per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t last month and the price increased by 12 % compared to June .
in Latvia and Lithuania , the price fell by five percent to EUR 3@@ 6.@@ 27 per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t hour .
in Finland , the price was EUR 34.@@ 17 and the system price of the electricity exchanges in the Nord half was EUR 2@@ 6.@@ 37 per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t @-@ hour .
prices rose by 12 and 7 % respectively .
between Estonia and Finland , electricity moved 75 % of the hours of last month towards Estonia and 16 % of hours from Estonia to Finland .
the remaining 9 % of the hours between the two countries did not take place next day .
electricity was moving between Estonia and Latvia at 99 % of the time from Estonia to Latvia and 73 % of the hours used all transmission capacity .
in the last trading day of July , according to the Nas@@ da@@ q OM@@ X market transactions , the electricity exchange price could be around 34 euros per me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t in August and 37 in September .
the carbon price affecting electricity production increased last month and transactions took place at 5.@@ 04 @-@ 5.@@ 47 euros per tonne .
high @-@ speed living - half @-@ order and smart de@@ sig@@ ners have made it the little Ear@@ ls Court room house .
Jo@@ anne Le@@ igh , a former ban@@ ker with passion for building , swit@@ ched his big K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge home in 2014 against the Ear@@ ls Court flat .
this is on the first floor of Qu@@ e@@ en Anne Ter@@ tse@@ n , and the fact that Jo@@ anne has not pul@@ led her bags together and sold the fla@@ me on is an tribute to a new design .
&quot; before that , my former fellow Member and I lived on much larger soil in K@@ n@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; said Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I asked for something that would be tanta@@ mount to the price I have offered .
I was shown that by the Ear@@ ls Court flat and had the same high sentences .
I sat in it and made an offer the same day . &quot;
since its first visit , this fifteen @-@ me@@ tre cor@@ ps has passed through a complete innovation unit .
at the beginning , it was one of the Cor@@ ps with s@@ lee@@ ping and complex posi@@ tioning - you had to walk through the kit@@ chen to get to s@@ le@@ ep , and Jo@@ anne wanted to add savings and half order to take advantage of the high levels of ambition .
&quot; I wanted a lot of light , a lot of hot air .
these were my demands , &apos; he said .
he asked for the architecture and design radio@@ s of Er@@ fan Az@@ ori@@ an N@@ ot@@ ting in Hil@@ lis to take advantage of 3.@@ 8 m of the de@@ ser@@ t and to create a home that is not just a development site but a place in which Jo@@ anne can live .
it was not high enough to add two space to each other , so the archite@@ ctural challenge was to create a qu@@ asi @-@ order where one could stand .
Mr FÃ¼le had to take a creative approach .
&apos;@@ Me@@ tal@@ l@@ design is quite complex , &apos; he explains .
&quot; we had to reform our premises so that they were located on each other without ne@@ eding to bo@@ w down .
it was not just a matter of building a platform , but of using steel construction to ensure that the he@@ ight of the upper and lower spaces is right . &quot;
this move has enabled Er@@ fan@@ a to create two rooms with full e@@ ars , with a lot of dramatic elements .
half @-@ time lighting from the R@@ et@@ rou@@ vi@@ us window provides an answer to gla@@ d@@ ity housing under the car@@ pet .
a gol@@ den piece of fur@@ ni@@ ture , sil@@ ver details and retro@@ ch@@ inaugu@@ ral Ser@@ ge M@@ ou@@ ille &apos; light under@@ score space .
the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in the inclusion of theat@@ re , space and lighting .
there are mir@@ rors attached at the end of both short corridors , so that it would seem longer .
in K@@ mid@@ l , the mir@@ ror &apos;s back @-@ in @-@ the @-@ eye window gives the impression of another tu@@ mble window .
the scen@@ es provide a mir@@ ror ho@@ p for all Jo@@ anne &apos;s b@@ ath clo@@ thes and glass requirements .
in addition to housing , the possibility of shu@@ tting down part of vegetables if it is not used , creates a more gla@@ mo@@ rous space of images .
the cu@@ mber@@ some kit@@ chen is nothing new .
in this kit@@ chen , however , it is unique that it is a re@@ sur@@ gent door of gar@@ age .
&apos;@@ Th@@ at a little bit of a design effort &apos; clarifies the M@@ D@@ F , a spo@@ iled by Er@@ fan steel .
&apos;@@ It has a counter@@ weight , which is why it is so simple to roll it out &apos; .
thanks to the smart use of space and ho@@ arding , Jo@@ anne now has 16 supplementary metres , an extra be@@ dro@@ om and a better corridor plan .
&apos;@@ After all , flo@@ oring sur@@ faces are what you sell - or what gives property value , &apos; says Er@@ fan .
&apos;@@ Ac@@ cor@@ ding to the reserve floor , he takes an outdated form of tu@@ mble and makes calculations based on the area of underground land &apos; .
here they have managed to expand the floor , using high @-@ quality materials that add luxury to the premises .
&quot; materials are what you are tou@@ ching on and thus help create an emotional link with your home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&apos;@@ You do not love electricity cable in the pig .
it is important , but it does not inspire heart to speak . &quot;
this shows that good design and increased surface area help do something ama@@ zing from a rather standard cor@@ al .
in fact , they may even lead to a desire not to leave , as happened with Jo@@ anne .
the chief figure , Jen@@ sen , is the Chief Arab village in Ch@@ ic@@ ago &apos;s cloud , which is competing with a colleague for professional excellence .

on the first side of the film , I think it is a version of the business world of the Ka@@ ar@@ di@@ house - even K@@ ev@@ in S@@ pac@@ ey and Ger@@ ard Bu@@ tle@@ r .
however , the less ad@@ jac@@ ent element remains , and the moral intention of film @-@ makers is beginning to appear more and more .
life @-@ changing experience will lead to a bo@@ y @-@ infected illness .
now there must be a choice between professional and family life .
the po@@ et who wri@@ tes in the offices of architecture forces father to think about the great buildings of Ch@@ ic@@ ago , which are of real importance , such as religion , well @-@ being , love ... , without even affecting the catastrophe of the tw@@ o@@ fold .
after the third semester , where the po@@ et opens the eyes of the father , there is a feeling that film @-@ makers are certainly guided by the aim of cur@@ bing the audience , because even the most heart @-@ hear@@ ted specta@@ tor is unable to keep te@@ ars back in the eye of the suffering of a brutal cancer @-@ sick bo@@ y .
if the po@@ et falls into the house and his situation seems hope@@ less , the father will once and for all understand the mor@@ ality of his work and will do a good job for the old man seeking a good job .
now , in my mind , I am lu@@ cky enough - if there is a label , I reward my deli@@ ght after a film &apos;s coff@@ ee , if I am wrong , then the st@@ inc@@ t can be praised for at least one surprise .
for a moment , there is a suspicion that there will be no shortage of coff@@ ee - when a hus@@ band calls a hospital and a man wal@@ ks down a corridor in slow motion .
however , it has been extremely healthy , and although her father has just lost her job , it will prove positive , because now it is time to deal with the family .
I can also feel comfortable - I can already predict quite well the end of the American dra@@ ma .
in truth , the film has been well designed ; all the necessary elements exist .
you can get a k@@ ni@@ fe , you can lau@@ gh , actors are a good and moral beau@@ ty : money is not the most important thing in life .
it is a film that gets off the ground .
the new staff top of the T@@ ru@@ m plans to limit the President &apos;s media consumption .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps Mr F@@ . Kelly can do it in real terms .
in that case , it would be the first .
Poli@@ tic@@ o wri@@ tes that the new staff surplus in the White House intends to limit the flow of information reaching President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in , including news , in the hope that it will keep the balance in the water .
here there is a pla@@ gue repor@@ ter Joseph h D@@ aw@@ se@@ y :
&quot; when John F@@ . Kelly , the new chief staff of the White House , met high officials on his first day of work , he highlighted the key problem President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i in White Ma@@ s , which he plans to solve in his hands the recei@@ pt of the PEACE bad information into the hands of the President .
Mr Kelly told the officials that the information has to go through him , either on paper or in meetings , because the President would make better decisions if he had good information . &quot;
Mr Kelly &apos;s diagnosis seems to be completely logical , but others have also tried to do so and they have failed to tame him by monitoring his media consumption .
President T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i &apos;s relationship with television goes back decades and , even now he is in the White House , his TV viewing habits have gone nowhere .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen the candidate T@@ ru@@ mp was a vice because of unfair media coverage , he was told that his publications were also fair , &apos; said S@@ am N@@ un@@ berg to Policy in February .
Poli@@ tic@@ o tara Pal@@ mer wrote at the time that &apos; T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter , according to the six former campaig@@ ners , is the key to running habits of the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter , to ensure that his personal media consumption also contains a flat ch@@ orus of praise &apos; .
well done .
however , the idea that T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i Twitter &apos;s use habits have once been &apos; under control &apos; is ridiculous .
perhaps these campaig@@ ners know something that the rest of us do not know that the s@@ and@@ ers of T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i would have been even more sur@@ real without their interference .
we will probably never be able to find out about the remaining charges that the T@@ ru@@ mp did not issue .
if he managed to rescue his hel@@ ple@@ ss even a few times over , his efforts were worth it .
but nobody has managed to prevent T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i from systematically creating controversy .
part of the problem is that in the White House , which is made up of competing cli@@ mates , people are trying exclusively to promote their own interests by passing on to the Olympic Games material that supports their views on the world stage , but which is not always reliable .
Poli@@ tic@@ o , reflecting the evolution of the whole story , wrote strategically questionable information to the President about the ten@@ ac@@ ity of the advis@@ ors in May .
one example described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ ma@@ cher is as follows :
&quot; the present and former T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i are saying that T@@ ru@@ mp can react to a negative press , particularly with damaging effects , explo@@ ding , by cutting off their source .
this also happened at the end of February , when someone happily gave the President a copy of the internet provo@@ cative , Charles C. G@@ ot@@ New@@ s.@@ com , a website belonging to Joh@@ n@@ son , accused the de@@ pu@@ ties of Ka@@ tie Wal@@ sh of being the white house &apos; source of several le@@ aks &apos; .
it does not matter that Joh@@ n@@ son has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of mo@@ cking , or that he has provided no concrete evidence or that he has also made false accusations in the past and recalled them .
the College read the article and started to ask about Wales , which is the subject . &quot;
Gold@@ ma@@ cher added that the staff chief at that time , Rhine Pri@@ eb@@ us , and Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , head of the White House , have tried to establish a system for the management and documentation of the documents reaching T@@ ru@@ mp@@ in . &quot;
how did it succeed ?
Mr Kelly is attempting to do exactly the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader of Pri@@ eb@@ us@@ s , but the T@@ ru@@ mp is still an impul@@ se and his assistants are still in competition for influence .
these un@@ changing factors make Mr Kelly &apos;s mission very difficult .
street mus@@ ici@@ ans from abroad will not be able to obtain permission to speak .
in the centre of Tallinn , many foreigners are taking refuge .
those with whom the le@@ af@@ let came to the talk acknowledged that they were playing in the old age without the consent of the urban government .
the first is that we found three street mus@@ ici@@ ans who had taken the same amount with them at the gates of Vir@@ u .
it was clear to see that mus@@ ici@@ ans with ra@@ inf@@ all and sme@@ ll clo@@ thes were the home travellers who would have to spend one of the du@@ ch@@ Å¡ mar@@ ches .
despite the ad@@ versity , the only woman in the company played a story of a@@ cor@@ di@@ on@@ al r@@ hy@@ th@@ m , while one man , alongside him , played three str@@ ings in K@@ ong and brought the fur@@ th@@ est closer .
the third man was sitting next to them in a house in ab@@ sen@@ tia and smo@@ ked a self @-@ prepared , self @-@ employed agricultural enterprise .
their three cha@@ mbers did not allow themselves to be distur@@ bed by the people that passed .
the A@@ cor@@ di@@ on @-@ playing No@@ emi and Pal@@ tel @-@ jet Boeing spoke about kis@@ sing the streets for both fu@@ n and money .
the purpose of the inquiry was to collect ticket money for a vessel travelling to Finland on the same day .
on the question of whether they asked for permission from the city for domin@@ ation in the old age , No@@ emi and Boeing sha@@ ke their head .
firstly , we did not know .
secondly , we will never stand for more than a day or a few in one town and , in most cases , permits will be granted for a month or something like that .
it makes no sense to pay for it , &apos; Mr Bo@@ b explained .
when , some 20 minutes later , we returned to the gates of Vir@@ u , we saw that two women are with mus@@ ici@@ ans and make them go .
the task force compla@@ ined to the crossroads of the Vir@@ u centre with its bags and bags .
there were also three Polish young men present on the Vir@@ u street , one of whom played on the sign , the other was ch@@ arity , and the third had even carried an electronic glass .
&quot; we are here to enter@@ tain people to spread music and joy and to earn money for fuel and living , &quot; explained the tri@@ o from M@@ iv@@ os@@ h .
according to M@@ iv@@ o@@ sh@@ i , they are aware that there has to be an urban government licence to speak .
&apos;@@ O@@ f course we do not have it &apos; , he said jo@@ kes .
but we hope that if people enjoy our music , there will be no problem .
of course , when the police come , we go elsewhere , but you have to try , &apos; he added .
in July , the Bank of Estonia bought bonds worth EUR 149 million under the public asset programme of central banks in the euro area , and the Central Bank bond portfolio increased to EUR 4.@@ 36 billion .
the Central Bank will not publish more detailed information on purchases .
the President of the Bank of Estonia , Har@@ do H@@ ans@@ son , has explained in the past that the deposi@@ tory scheme of the euro system includes three different purchasing programmes : financial sector bonds ( CMO ) , asset bonds ( A@@ B@@ S ) and public bonds ( PS@@ PP ) .
the Central Bank will buy up bonds on the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere .
the impact of purchases will fall in the production of lower @-@ risk assets , and this will motivate investors to take greater risks .
as a rule , within the framework of the public debt programme , each Central Bank bu@@ ys its own government bonds , and the bonds of other countries are not purchased .
as no bonds have been issued by the Estonian state , the Estonian bank will make so @-@ called substitu@@ tion purchases within the limits set aside .
the central banks also shop in those countries where the provision of shares eligible for the purchase scheme is limited .
on the basis of the statement of Mr H@@ ans@@ son , the Bank of Estonia is generally buying bonds from the European institutions , such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank bonds .
the Bank of Estonia will buy bonds as part of the asset buying programme as of March 2015 .
in the meantime , the government of Estonia &apos;s debt was also bought , but the Estonian bank will no longer buy up bonds in June 2016 .
on behalf of the central banks in the euro area , both Ele@@ ring and Estonian energy bonds will be bought by the Bank of Finland .
migrants ignore the dit@@ ch and return to a &apos; million business base &apos; .
some of the most prosperous home owners in the West Mid@@ lands have once again found themselves in a fier@@ ce confrontation with determined travellers who have ignored the cra@@ ck of the coun@@ ty to win back their fields away from the cotton .
migrants have par@@ ked their 20 tra@@ ilers into a prosperous circle of &apos; millions of businesses &apos; near the street of So@@ ly@@ ul@@ li .
they have returned , together with the ar@@ mi@@ es of hor@@ ses , children and lorries , after they were only shot out of it in May , without being confused by the dit@@ ch ex@@ iled to prevent their invasion by the Council .
the active group found itself weak in the limits of protection , turning its vehicles away from the un@@ blocked part that was left to wal@@ king .
the people of M@@ aru@@ ang@@ ry have moved to the So@@ alig@@ ul@@ li Council saying that it is &apos; useless to deal with the problem &apos; .
an anon@@ ymous person said : &apos; they moved there on Monday evening after being excluded from Ben@@ tle@@ y He@@ ath@@ on , where they were st@@ oned .
the Council must be ashamed to take action , because it is useless to deal with the problem .
the migrants were there in May , they were driven to go , and now they are back again .
they came up last night , probably even more so today . &quot;
he added , &apos; Bir@@ min@@ g@@ ha@@ m Coun@@ ty Council knows how to deal with such things by acquiring long barriers to the protection of its par@@ ks .
I live on street et@@ s@@ bro@@ o@@ k , and I am not satisfied that I must continue to pay a total mandate if the Council cannot even hinder such a thing . &quot;
a local person who also wanted to remain anon@@ ymous said , &apos; that is ridiculous ; we have just seen the latter leave these travellers , and a new offensive is already under way .
this time , the number has increased , and even the horse has been seen in ru@@ ins . &apos;
a representative of the So@@ ks@@ ul@@ li Council said , &apos; we are aware that on the land off the street street street street s@@ bro@@ o@@ k , it is unacceptable to have a camp pla@@ te , and we are working with the So@@ ks@@ ul@@ li police ; we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible .
the gathering of evidence will be very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any antis@@ o@@ cial or criminal behaviour to the police , calling the number 101 .
this will help to create an understanding of the situation for the Court when we present the case to them . &quot;
the We@@ ek@@ end festi@@ val will be attended by , among others , the Minister for Culture , In@@ dre@@ k Sa@@ ar , who is pleased that real world top names have been brought to Estonia .
the question of why it is so important for the We@@ ek@@ end festi@@ val Est@@ oni@@ ans is that it should be asked by all those who are enjoying the festi@@ val three days in full .
what he says is that there are real players in the area of enlargement .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen you look at the level of artists that has been able to bring to Estonia , the absolute top names of this mus@@ ical gesture are taken home - this is often not the case in our j@@ arg@@ on &apos; , the Minister for Culture talks .
which artists on the F@@ esti@@ val , however , are the most widely spoken of ?
I consider myself to be relatively old , and for the old people of some kind , there is certainly one of the most experienced ar@@ mi@@ es , Ar@@ min van B@@ abinet , who stood up yesterday evening .
after all , at some point in time , all of us have complicated our own feet &apos; , he says .
however , he is still highlighting a number of names , such as Cha@@ in@@ COM , De@@ ad@@ ma@@ u@@ 5 , K@@ ni@@ fe@@ mite .
of course , our own Estonian players : starting with NO@@ SET P and they can be read in a whole series .
in reality , this concentration of well @-@ known names is very high , &quot; he says .

innovation of authors in mid @-@ criticism of car manufacturers to 850 000 diesel vehicles
a day before the Au@@ di announcement , B@@ M@@ W said that it provides software for more than 350 000 vehicles .
according to the Chairman of B@@ M@@ W , the company believes &apos; that there are smarter options than driving restrictions &apos; , referring to European cities , including the city of B@@ M@@ W , Munich , which has considered banning or thro@@ t@@ tling diesel vehicles .
Da@@ im@@ ler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe will renew their emissions from diesel engines .
no company described these operations as being recalled .
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the US to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions .
however , nitrogen ox@@ ide em@@ itted from diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and may cause as@@ th@@ ma .
at the same time , equipment to neutr@@ alise emissions from diesel vehicles will increase , making it difficult to keep cars competitive .
while the German car manufacturers are under scrutiny , the Federal Chancellor , Angela Merkel , is also accused of le@@ c@@ turing the powerful car manufacturers and ignoring the signs referring to the problem .
companies are attempting to avoid repeating the mistakes of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen , who remained silent about the use of so @-@ called &apos; hidden devices &apos; that made it possible to adapt the face of exha@@ ust gases to the regulations when testing a car , but were brought back in normal driving conditions .
several Presidents of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month in Germany , a former head of the Tit@@ le of the Visa dynamism Division of the Au@@ di engine Development Department was arrested .
former President Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Gi@@ o@@ van@@ ni Pa@@ mi@@ o is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and can go to justice in the United States .
earlier this year , the Au@@ di was drawn into criminal investigations involving Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen in Germany , when the authorities accused the auditing system of instal@@ ling it in order to circum@@ vent European requirements for gas emissions , thus widening the investigation , which was previously focused on the United States .
the inclusion of the author in the investigation may be a major blow to Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen , a manufacturer of securi@@ tisation cars , generating a disproportionate proportion of the profits of Vol@@ ks@@ wa@@ gen .
European Union flags will be bought at Estonian schools for EUR 20 000 .
by 1 September , the Ministry of Education intends to buy EU flags for the Estonian schools to mark the Presidency .
in total , the measu@@ re@@ ments will be made by 105@@ x@@ 15@@ 8 c@@ enti@@ metres of the European Union flag by 5@@ 70 educational institutions .
Li@@ ps are intended to demonstrate in in@@ door spaces ; they must also be carried out in high quality printing techniques with an eye assurance in in@@ door spaces ; the ER@@ R news portal will be moder@@ ated .
on the flag label , the text reads : &apos; approval of Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union of Estonia &apos; .
the estimated cost of 5@@ 70 flags is EUR 20 000 at the expense of the Ministry of Education , or one flag costs EUR 35 .
journalist murder highlights the growing threat situation in Mexico
weekly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers usually gather on Wednesday to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the state of Blue oa , so@@ wn by organised crime , corrupt officials and un@@ stop@@ p@@ able drug wars .
but today , under the gu@@ ise of a personal tragedy , they have gathered to discuss their own security .
they are told that it is important to change our rou@@ tine .
two elderly wri@@ ters will discuss which seems safer : either to bring children into a office that was the target of a gran@@ dio@@ se attack in 2009 or leave them home .
security experts have written three words to the willing at the head : &apos; enemies &apos; , &apos; neutrality &apos; , &apos; allies &apos; .
they ask repor@@ ters to provide no stone names , only to have impres@@ sions and an internal feeling .
the presence of a government or car@@ tels is suspected of being a list of drug traffickers , politicians , business@@ men and journalists who make it dangerous to cover the chaos prevailing in Mexico .
there is no b@@ reat@@ h of violence , and the more deaths are asse@@ m@@ bled across the country , the greater of which journalists form part of the Round for the protection of journalists , according to President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Men@@ to &apos;s inaugu@@ ration in December 2012 , have been killed by at least 25 : 5@@ 89 journalists since attacks and threats under state protection , and this year , at least seven journalists have been killed .
the latter include their edit@@ or and source of inspiration , Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den , co @-@ foun@@ der of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce .
&apos;@@ The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &apos; wrote Val@@ dez in one of its many drug @-@ based books .
his absence is deeply felt , although his presence may be felt everywhere on the Bil@@ Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building fa@@ Ã§@@ ade , a big picture of the average finger @-@ pointing in Val@@ dez , with the letter &apos; Justice &apos; , and two of the 30 reports , A@@ ar@@ on I@@ bar@@ ra and M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez , wear T @-@ shir@@ ts , which have been de@@ pic@@ ted by their s@@ lip@@ per@@ y glas@@ ses , or by a pan@@ ac@@ op@@ ian bar@@ rel characteristic of him .
less than two months after his death , the Portuguese people are discussing common trau@@ ma , their n@@ ight@@ m@@ are , their hope@@ lessness , their paran@@ o@@ ia .
although a public Prosecutor &apos;s office was set up to deal with journalists cases in 2010 , only two cases have been prosecuted by the Committee on the Protection of journalists .
as in the case of most annual murders involving drug trafficking and organised crime involving thousands , the number of kil@@ lers of journalists is rarely brought to justice .
the presence of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce continues to reflect the violence in Sin@@ al@@ o , even though their hearts have been broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous .
without the data and justice of murde@@ rers , the meeting on security , I@@ bar@@ ra , said , is of little use .
&apos;@@ It is very ridiculous to waste our time here at this meeting , &apos; he says .
&quot; as long as the cause is not known , you will dis@@ trust everyone . &quot;
Val@@ dez la@@ gs from the office of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , capital of Val@@ li@@ dez , on 15 May .
he managed to travel just a few quarters before having stopped the Red To@@ y@@ o@@ ta Co@@ rol@@ la , who was forced to leave the car and shot 12 times , supposedly because of the name of the newspaper , which means an interpre@@ tative &apos; twelve river &apos; .
an armed man travelled to the car in Val@@ dez and thus made an accident in its vic@@ inity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
she was left behind by a woman and two adults .
the rum@@ ours spread freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
however , on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is essentially silence .
since the arrest of Gu@@ z@@ man last year and the extradition of the United States in January , Y@@ al@@ oa has been one of the bloo@@ di@@ est bat@@ tle@@ fields in the country , because ri@@ val cli@@ cks are fighting to fill a power vacuum .
it does not matter that a person , or indeed several , is being abandoned every day in the streets of your permits , or that the dead are sli@@ ding away from the so@@ rely dre@@ ams of double @-@ hat@@ ted drug por@@ tals , which are larger than many homes .
let us remember for a moment that the time of peace indicates how precious ports and the maritime state along the lines of drug routes to the United States are headed by only one car@@ tel .
despite all this and the fact that Val@@ dez was fully aware of the dangers associated with its work , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s co @-@ foun@@ der and president , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , feels that he was unable to defend his friend .
he believes that this murder was facilitated by two mistakes .
the first was the publication in February of an interview with the Gu@@ z@@ man sons of Gu@@ z@@ man , who are competing and on war @-@ tor@@ n car@@ tel , with D@@ amas@@ o L@@ ope@@ z .
this piece of correspon@@ dence could even be allu@@ ded to by the gang members suspected of having bought all cop@@ ies of publications as soon as they were reached in the newspapers .
the second mistake was that Val@@ dez was not forced to leave the country for his own security after having had a crackdown in one of the newspapers that reported the same story .
Val@@ dez was a leg@@ end both in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico .
he had lived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .
he worked as a ve@@ ter@@ ant repor@@ ter at the No@@ ro@@ sian newspaper in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , selling 50 dollars .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said that Y@@ al@@ o@@ as &apos; it was impossible to deal with the press without tou@@ ching on the drug problem &apos; .
the newspaper took a long time to be known with its courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising grew .
the Portuguese people liked to express vigorous studies without fear of censorship and read@@ ers in a fasc@@ in@@ ating print , which they could read stories that no one else da@@ red to reflect .
eight years after Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce was set up , Maria Mo@@ ors C@@ ab@@ ot won the pres@@ ti@@ gious Maria Mo@@ ors C@@ ab@@ ot Awards for her Latin American coverage .
in the same year , Val@@ dez &apos;s Committee on the Protection of journalists ( AK@@ K ) won the International Press Freedom of the Press Award for its courage to follow Mexic@@ an drug creation wherever it leads .
he openly admitted that he was afraid .
&apos;@@ I want to live on , &apos; he said when he received the AK@@ K Prize .
last October , in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ en@@ to TV , he said that drug trafficking is a way of life in your own region .
&apos;@@ We face up to the challenge that the journalist &apos;s office brings with it a second chance to play the game .
I do not want to ask me what I did in the face of so many deaths , or why I did not speak about what is going on . &apos;
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce College long for W@@ ho@@ desi@@ ra@@ z , a man of jo@@ ke like mad@@ ness , a friend who gene@@ rously shared embry@@ os and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they supported his rou@@ tine .
he always rol@@ led his bar@@ rel .
he went from the office to El Madagascar y@@ ab@@ o bar and was always sitting on the same table .
now they are asking whether his rou@@ tine love became fatal to her .
his death has also led them to doubt how best to do their job and to stay alive .
&quot; they do not like the ri@@ gi@@ d@@ ity of women , their children , their legitimate businesses , with these secret landing sites used to transport drugs . &quot;
&apos;@@ Th@@ ese things should not have been touched , &apos; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result , even in the best times , is strong self @-@ censorship and self @-@ estee@@ m .
entr@@ us@@ ting your in@@ st@@ inc@@ ts .
if it is suspi@@ cious , the hotel is thrown away .
according to the edit@@ or of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , And@@ res Vil@@ lar@@ rez , the problem is that &apos; a fra@@ gran@@ ce can be dece@@ ived ... and that is how it happened to J@@ ternity &apos; .
he and others say that you no longer have old rules in place , just as they do not apply to the toxic composition of the Ta@@ ma@@ u@@ li@@ pa@@ sis , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Guer@@ re@@ iro or other states that are home to the toxic composition of profitable smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt state officials .
the landscape is constantly changing .
suddenly , in the space where Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers met for security training , mobile phones were no longer permitted ; a few days before , it was revealed that the sp@@ y@@ ware sold only to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
in front of the house , two police officers esca@@ ped from 40 Â° 6 under the gu@@ ise of the t@@ ree .
the government appointed a more elected office in Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the four @-@ order building of the Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an middle @-@ class neighbourhood .
some repor@@ ters won@@ dered half @-@ jo@@ king whether these police officers belong to the 50 % of police officers who have been driven by the Governor himself .
several months have passed since repor@@ ters have been travelling to mountainous rural areas where control is de facto in the hands of drug gan@@ gs .
Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s edition this week covered three main beau@@ ties .
one of them was the murder of the former po@@ xi@@ leg@@ ist Ju@@ li@@ o Movement ar Cha@@ vez bro@@ ther in Y@@ al@@ o@@ as .
furthermore , they had an reve@@ aling story of the spending of government funds on the town of the Governor &apos;s home town .
and a group of people were rob@@ bed of one of the most expensive restaur@@ ants from Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , which is located from a c@@ abinet quarter .
there was no formal announcement of who was kidna@@ pped or how this happened , so caution had to be taken when it was time to write what everyone in the town of Fland@@ restaur@@ ant knows is the fav@@ ou@@ rite place of both drug traffickers and public authorities .
the Portuguese became aware of public documents that a restaur@@ ant is registered with the names of a politician who belongs to the prevailing Institu@@ tional Rev@@ olu@@ tionary Party ( IR@@ P ) , which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the last century .
recently , several IR@@ P govern@@ ors have been accused of corruption within the framework of widely reported cases .
Vil@@ lar@@ line asked repor@@ ter to write past incidents in the same place , including how the son of Gu@@ z@@ mani man , who holds the name El Chap@@ o , esca@@ ped from the military line .
just a few months earlier , read@@ ers would have been looking to the do@@ or@@ step in Val@@ dez to find out about the kid@@ napp@@ ings from the best sources .
&apos;@@ In the past , we would have known what happened &apos; said in Vil@@ lar@@ real 46 years old , whose body building of bro@@ ker bodies earned him a sh@@ ou@@ ting name El Fla@@ co .
&quot; now all communication channels have broken down with our sources . &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez has become a be@@ ac@@ on for bridges and stic@@ kers protesting against the murder of journalists , and the edit@@ orial staff have become something they could never have expected of activists in the name of the press .
the Re@@ por@@ ter M@@ iri@@ am Ra@@ mi@@ rez seized a few eyes and moved to the office of local prosecutors next morning to the demonstration for another journalist .
Mr Salvador A@@ midst the chaos in the Western state of Mic@@ ho@@ ac@@ an , three days after the killing of Val@@ dez .
a body has been found to be bur@@ nt down and , according to officials , it is based on DNA tests .
journalists have become more vo@@ cal all over the country and are highlighting the &apos; S@@ OS press &apos; phrase as an organised protest against wal@@ king routes and buildings .
on that day , President Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington , trying to raise international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
the day after the death of Val@@ dez in meetings with Y@@ al@@ oa Dis@@ rup@@ ner , Ra@@ mi@@ rez accused journalists of sh@@ ou@@ ting and killing them of telling the truth .
after that , he asked for him to be diver@@ ted from reflecting the government &apos;s actions , while worried that he had been affected by his objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had said many times that Mexic@@ an journalists were &apos; restricted &apos; to organised crime , compli@@ cit state officials and an indifferent society .
in his latest book &apos; The drug press &apos; , he wrote that the repor@@ ters are not only killed by drug gan@@ gs , but are also carried out under the command of politicians and security forces who are in contact with organised crime .
Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 , the media monitoring group , awarded more than half of the attacks on the police and state officials last year .
&apos;@@ In Mexico , you DA , because you want to keep quiet , &apos; said Ra@@ mi@@ rez .
the effects are obviously bloody .
nobody for@@ gets the death of blo@@ gg@@ ers Maria E@@ liz@@ abeth Ma@@ ci@@ as in the northern border state of Ta@@ ma@@ u@@ li@@ pa@@ sis six years ago .
his body was found with a letter that was probably signed by the car@@ tel in L@@ OS Z@@ e@@ tas : &apos; I am here for my reports &apos; .
alongside her char@@ tered head , she le@@ ak@@ ed computer bo@@ gus and head@@ phones .
some publications have decided to close their doors , such as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in Chi@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ a , in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ a@@ hu@@ a , after the killing of the flat correspon@@ dent Gay B@@ PI in March .
others will carry on as the newspaper El Man@@ ana de Nu@@ ev@@ o L@@ are@@ do did after the murder of their President in 2004 .
in 2010 , the newspaper Di@@ ari@@ o de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z spoke publicly to the drug car@@ tel with the headline &apos; What do you want of us ? &apos;
some journalists have fled from the home state or even the country .
this is a ner@@ v@@ ous decision .
it is difficult to find a job on the wrong track and they still have to stay on the streets to avoid the dangers .
and sometimes they are being driven down , as probably happened with the part of the photo@@ graph Ru@@ be@@ n E@@ sp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered with four women in Mexico in 2015 three months after Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z had fled .
those who remain on the ground and continue to work must dance around risky decisions every day .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to become a po@@ et , ad@@ mits that reporting drugs business is frigh@@ tening her .
&quot; Mexico is on its way to hell and that is why I become repor@@ ter , &quot; he said .
during a recent mid@@ night of Friday , when the most recent number had already been lu@@ mped down , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce ed@@ itors sat down in front of the office and k@@ iss when all the phones suddenly began to be cal@@ ib@@ rated .
in Ma@@ z@@ at@@ lan@@ i , the govern@@ or in Ma@@ z@@ at@@ lan@@ i , 19 people were killed in fire @-@ fighting between ri@@ val gan@@ gs and security forces .
war continued es@@ tu@@ ary , as promised by a number of messages left on car@@ tels found in the region .
on the back of the same line , repor@@ ters posted a Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce website using a mobile phone .
there was a need for change next day .
the upgra@@ ded Hu@@ tus under@@ went a new round @-@ off in the region .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez pi@@ il@@ w to the police on the streets to see if they are vigilant .
if they were afraid , they at least did not show it .
the de@@ scen@@ ding foun@@ der under the mass sports ree , which has seen his average finger on the whole blue , has been delivered by Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce workers in his foot@@ steps .
&apos;@@ Ho@@ w can one think of closure at all , &apos; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &apos; whereas on the same day that Javier killed , a tra@@ ine@@ e asked me to send him a report to the streets ? &apos;
D@@ in@@ osa@@ ur used protective col@@ ours to prevent enemies
at first sight , it sounds like a form , albeit rather frigh@@ tening .
scientists have now unve@@ iled the first findings of an incredible r@@ hy@@ th@@ m estimate discovered by a Canadian mine , which has been so well maintained that experts have described it as &apos; din@@ osa@@ ur Mon@@ a Lis@@ at &apos; .
it has been so well maintained that it was even possible to establish that a sk@@ in covered by his so@@ om@@ ings was a red bo@@ w of Brown &apos;s col@@ ours and his past had been somewhat &apos; complicated &apos; .
the current Bi@@ ology report in the magaz@@ ine described the status as &apos; the most preserved so@@ om@@ al@@ din@@ din@@ ance that has ever been found &apos; and as one of the best din@@ osa@@ ences worldwide &apos; .
in the case of fossil , it is a new type of no@@ do@@ sa@@ ic sur@@ ger@@ y living in the middle of the cri@@ cket age , 110 @-@ 112 million years ago .
its incredibly good storage in Ru@@ das researchers describing it as &apos; really significant &apos; .
this vege@@ tarian ca@@ tering covered by Fin@@ ns has been the best preserved in this type of ph@@ os@@ ph@@ orus that has ever been found according to National Ge@@ o@@ decades .
this was found on 21 March 2011 in Sha@@ wn &apos;s fun@@ k , when he extra@@ cted from the Sun@@ c@@ or Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um mine For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in Northern Alber@@ tas , Canada .
he struck something that did not remind the surrounding stone and decided to look into it .
the newly discovered ph@@ os@@ ph@@ orus sent the Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell Pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ology muse@@ um .
for the next six years , it was designed to ex@@ tri@@ cate the animal from 2 500 p@@ ounds ( 1 100 @-@ km ) .
after all this hard work , the end result is now finally ready to bring the public to the public .
&apos;@@ It is almost credible to see him s@@ le@@ ep , &apos; Cal@@ e@@ b Brown , the leading author , a research@@ er in the Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell muse@@ um , said he was s@@ lee@@ ping .
&quot; this goes down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osa@@ ences - din@@ osa@@ ur Mon@@ a Lis@@ ana . &quot;
she went on to find that this vege@@ tation , although covered by soya properties and re@@ minis@@ cent of wal@@ king tan@@ k , was likely to be seriously threatened by meat @-@ fed din@@ osa@@ urs .
this din@@ osa@@ ur of so@@ ber properties used red and white col@@ ours to hide from pre@@ da@@ tors and applied sha@@ king techniques called &apos; counter @-@ insur@@ gency &apos; , which are also used by many of today &apos;s animals .
this enabled the din@@ osa@@ ur to get better off the ground and to prevent enemies , according to experts , as major din@@ osa@@ urs probably kept a hun@@ t .
this presence of the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old family of no@@ do@@ sa@@ ic sur@@ faces was first in the news in May and is now in the Ro@@ yal T@@ yr@@ rell &apos;s pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ology muse@@ um .
researchers have now looked at the present and given it the name &apos; Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta Mar@@ mit@@ chel@@ li muse@@ um laboratory &apos; , mark Mitchell , who was part of a team that spent more than 7 000 hours reve@@ aling the animal &apos;s hard@@ ship .
thanks to the ama@@ zing good maintenance of the father , Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists have been able to document the shape and size of the Fin@@ ns in the body .
they discovered a contradiction - a method of protection in animal welfare , which means that it was dar@@ ker than it was at the bottom of its existence .
although the counter @-@ hos@@ tility is ri@@ fe , the findings come as a surprise , as Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta is much larger than today &apos;s re@@ packa@@ ged animals .
it implies that din@@ osa@@ ur disease was hun@@ ted with sufficient force by other din@@ osa@@ ur pressure that evolution preferred to cover up instead of being a life@@ blood ta@@ ctic .
however , most of the animals using modern counter @-@ refu@@ el@@ ling - such as sca@@ ms , pigs or lo@@ gs - are much smaller and more vulnerable as yields , indicating that no@@ do@@ sa@@ sur@@ l had to make a real effort to survive .
&quot; a vigorous hun@@ t of the din@@ osa@@ ur covered by vast and abundan@@ t soya be@@ ds shows how dangerous it could have been to ride off the din@@ osa@@ ur , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic comp@@ ounds of So@@ om@@ us also revealed that the din@@ osa@@ ur &apos;s sk@@ in was a red bo@@ xes .
researchers will continue to investigate to get indications of this life , including the st@@ oring content of this salt po@@ di@@ um , in order to find out what the animal is for its last age .
they believe that din@@ osa@@ ur has failed in the dead rivers , thus entering the sea , where it was@@ hed over the ocean bed .
at that time , Alber@@ tas was as warm as it is now in Southern Flor@@ ence , and rivers and oceans probably went much further into the internal land than they are today .
&quot; this no@@ do@@ sa@@ mic is truly remarkable because it is fully covered by a so@@ om@@ ic sk@@ in , but it has remained three @-@ dimensional while maintaining the original form of the animal , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; as a result , the animal today sees almost the same as in the cri@@ cket age .
it does not need to be very imag@@ in@@ ative to construct it - it is enough simply to throw our eyes on our eyes and it looks as if he s@@ le@@ ep . &quot;
the crisis era was a time when enormous two leg@@ s of meat @-@ bearing din@@ osa@@ urs - he@@ tero@@ shops - floo@@ ded .
although King Ty@@ ran@@ no@@ sa@@ ur@@ us re@@ x of all of them lived millions years later than Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta , this de@@ lu@@ ged din@@ osa@@ ur could be hun@@ ted by some of his frigh@@ tening predecess@@ ors .
these include A@@ cro@@ can@@ tho@@ x@@ ur@@ us , 38 leg@@ s ( 11.@@ 5 metres ) long and six tonne @-@ weigh@@ ting mon@@ sters .
scientists whose recent findings are published in the Journal current Bi@@ ology believe that Bo@@ real@@ ope@@ l@@ ta u@@ hu@@ t was sun@@ k after death in the sea and that it was mu@@ zz@@ led .
on 21 March 2011 , the title was discovered by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he extra@@ cted from the Mil@@ len@@ i@@ um mine For@@ t Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in Northern Alber@@ tas , Canada .
by the way , the M@@ use@@ um says that it is best maintained in the world , including sk@@ in and soya , and it is a complete concentration right up to the wood .
these entities were on average 18 leg@@ s ( 5 metres ) long and resumed at up to GBP 3 000 ( 13@@ 00 kg ) .
it was shoul@@ dered by two 20 customs @-@ long ora .
scientists believe that this soya @-@ covered mix@@ ture of flora through current Western Canada until it is dis@@ connected into the sea .
but the sub@@ marine bu@@ ried place of the din@@ osa@@ ur helped to maintain its Fin@@ ns in an excellent detail .
the rem@@ nan@@ ts of this particular father have maintained so well that my@@ ste@@ rious so@@ om@@ ic head@@ lines of din@@ osa@@ ur continue to cover sk@@ in ice .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote in the National Ge@@ o@@ chet magaz@@ ine : &apos; such a level of survival is as rare as a l@@ ot@@ tery .
the more I look at it , the more incredible it seems .
Dis@@ bur@@ nt lea@@ ther residues continue to cover my@@ ste@@ rious soya pla@@ tes located on animal tri@@ cks .
the better front page is sitting next to him , and five of the thi@@ ev@@ es have been rus@@ hed up .
I will be able to count the Fin@@ ns at his farm . &quot;
how did one activist find an answer to the question &apos; W@@ ho streets ? &apos;
on 9 August 2014 , Bri@@ t@@ tan@@ y Ferre@@ ll was completely shocked .
just a day after New York &apos;s travel , that was the father of St@@ . Lou@@ kas , Air@@ b , who was ren@@ ted on a do@@ zen bed , si@@ b@@ bed on Facebook .
he ended up in the post of his former fellow school member .
it reads : &apos; the police killed just 18 @-@ year @-@ old youn@@ g@@ sters and he is still lying on the street &apos; .
he was confused why nobody else had posted this information to his bed , which is why he closed down Facebook and opened Twitter .
the postal services of the P@@ ide@@ ga @ The@@ e@@ P@@ 45 users were repeatedly handed down in her line .
Mr St@@ . sili@@ c@@ z from the Lou@@ kas region sent in real time to Michael Brown , the death of an un@@ armed 18 @-@ year @-@ old black man murdered by a white police officer in Fer@@ gus@@ oni Mis@@ s@@ our@@ is .
he gave an idea of the existence of Bro@@ w@@ n &apos;s life in the streets , remaining four hours .
&apos;@@ It is cra@@ zy , &apos; thought about Ferreira &apos;s addi@@ tions .
but death was not new for him or for his community .
he put his phone off , but later seen the spar@@ k again this evening , reporting people &apos;s r@@ ally to Can@@ field D@@ ri@@ ve .
there were photo@@ graph@@ s of police and sh@@ ell@@ fish , and a man who claimed to be a father of Brown and kept a label &apos; my un@@ armed son was killed by the Fer@@ gus@@ oni police ! &apos;
he watched a real @-@ time stream where the police officer stood before a group of prote@@ sters with a grave do@@ ck .
in the second video , another police officer , he said : &apos; I kill all ... animals &apos; .
a Fer@@ rel@@ li will remember how he struck himself from the point of view : &apos; that is unusual &apos; .
&apos;@@ This is not the kind of murder to which we are ac@@ custo@@ med and which we could call typical &apos; .
I felt frigh@@ tened at this point .
I was ang@@ ry and I cri@@ ed . &apos;
he boo@@ ked a return flight and travelled home the following day .
having bu@@ ried at 23 : 00 , she went on to her six @-@ year @-@ old da@@ u@@ ghter and decided to travel to the two @-@ day Fer@@ gus@@ on next morning .
what happened next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ li and Fer@@ gus@@ oni is central to the new &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street ? &apos; ( &apos; who streets ? &apos; ) , which will be presented in cine@@ mas on 11 August .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and defeat , strength and fir@@ m@@ ness from the point of view of the people who live in this community and who are on the streets demanding answers .
when Ferre@@ ll , together with a da@@ u@@ ghter - who had a flow@@ ing bro@@ ker and had a fine with it - was driving towards Fer@@ gus@@ oni , they once again spoke about a subject that they had discussed many times before this morning - about black experiences and living conditions .
&apos;@@ D@@ o you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights ? &apos; recalls its question .
&apos;@@ We are currently travelling to Fer@@ gus@@ oni because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old bo@@ y and that is not right &apos; .
&apos;@@ I could not take him on board , &apos; said Ferre@@ ll later .
&apos;@@ What is happening now is ... the cul@@ mination of what happened in the past .
it needs to know and see it and grow in the middle of it .
it must learn about the activist and organisation , but it must also feel different la@@ yers of black experience and living conditions , and what we must do to free ourselves and to free ourselves .
even if I can bring him up in such a way that he does not personally experience cru@@ el@@ ty racism , he is no different from any other Muslim girl .
I feel I would do him a dis@@ service if I would protect him from this world . &quot;
the first stop they did in the Fer@@ gus@@ oni hands was on the South Flor@@ is@@ san@@ t - from the police station to the ground , which had become a sort of camp where activists were waiting for news about the police officer , Dar@@ re@@ n Wil@@ son , who was not at long last charged .
there , Mrs Ferre@@ ll and her da@@ u@@ ghter combined forces with local business owners who produced southern products .
they put together food bags and helped to distribute them to the prote@@ sters .
a new type of activist began to slow down for a Fer@@ rel@@ li .
&apos;@@ My activist changed utterly after 9 August , &apos; he said , saying that , when he was a student at Mis@@ s@@ our@@ i @-@ St@@ . Lou@@ isi University , he was President of the Association of pupils of Small Sci@@ ences and focused on inequalities in food justice and health in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience of organising .
all this was simply la@@ zy . &apos;
weeks later , a film co @-@ director , Sab@@ aa@@ h Fo@@ la@@ yan@@ i , met during a statement of protest by Ferre@@ ll evening .
Fo@@ lay@@ an said that he and the film operator , Mr Al@@ var@@ ad@@ o @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r , simply wanted to document what is going on .
the question came up as a Fer@@ rel@@ li : &apos; do you try to document what is happening or find a story that can be exploited ? &apos;
such scepticism was due to countless cases in which people - often white - come into the community and try to profit from its ri@@ gi@@ d@@ ity and resilience .
Fo@@ lay@@ an explained in a recent interview : &apos; we had heard that the voice of people born and growing in Fer@@ gus@@ on would not be heard and we wanted to do that differently &apos; .
Fo@@ lay@@ an had already beaten his hands with D@@ am@@ on Da@@ v@@ s , a fellow director in the region who was well @-@ known activists for prisoners sentenced to death .
his involvement made the project attractive for Fer@@ rel@@ li and for the other six local films , the &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street Process ? &apos; team , following the shooting of Brown , followed for years .
&apos;@@ In this docu@@ mentary , nobody talks for us or with us , but we speak for ourselves , &apos; said Da@@ vis .
&quot; it was important to me how these people are portra@@ yed , because that is how I am portra@@ yed . &quot;
although the aim was not to focus on the experience of Fer@@ rel@@ li - it was to show that the movement is not about &apos; the head of sal@@ vation &apos; , but about bringing the community together &apos; , as Fo@@ lay@@ an said , he became the most open party to the film .
as a result , &apos; W@@ ho@@ se street ets ? &apos; surpris@@ ingly personal aspects of the life of Fer@@ rel@@ li , such as love and marriage with her wife , are documented .
&apos;@@ I felt as if I had na@@ ked , &apos; said Ferre@@ ll , laugh@@ ing over the first time that he had seen his ready urban act .
&quot; but I realised that there is a need for a certain level of vulnerability when it comes to doing this job and to human@@ ising black people . &quot;
moreover , the Fer@@ rel@@ li story underlines and re@@ focuses the role of the black homo@@ sexual woman in the wider Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three initi@@ ators who , following the killing of Tra@@ y@@ von Martin , a black teen@@ ag@@ er in the social media in 2012 , inven@@ ted the h@@ ash@@ tag@@ s # Bla@@ ck@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter , are gay .
&apos;@@ In its leading role , black homo@@ sexual women have generally kept the movement in place , &apos; said Ferre@@ ll &apos; , precisely because we have to fight repeatedly on several fronts .
Roma homo@@ sexual women must bear the full burden . &quot;
Fo@@ lay@@ an agreed , pointing out that &quot; mobility really is kept alive by black women and many of them black women . &quot;
he says , however , that &apos; This is not about any type of equal opportunities &apos; - Fer@@ rel@@ li was not chosen as the fo@@ cal point of the film because of his identity .
&apos;@@ You were someone who gave the right energy , &apos; she said .
&quot; but it is no coincidence that he was there right at the front line , because a black homo@@ sexual woman living in such hu@@ bs is much at stake .
his energy can be perceived through the screen . &quot;
at the same time , the news camer@@ as Fer@@ gus@@ ona have long disappeared , but racial links between the community and the police are still fragile .
the suspended sentence imposed on a Fer@@ rell for blocking the road will last for another 2.5 years .
he describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere in a region he calls home , simply a &apos; huge freedom threat &apos; .
however , she still attaches importance to the man@@ tra she has ea@@ ten since she went to the Fer@@ gus@@ on street as a whole three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose except our chains . &quot;
7 g on how to overcome the my@@ ster@@ y after We@@ ek@@ entries
some of the stu@@ b@@ born fishermen will find that , after a scarce pi@@ pe , they will find out what they are suffering from , hence help .
or it is on the basis of the saying &apos; L@@ et &apos;s avoid a po@@ ker , a py@@ ra@@ mid &apos; .
but this is only an unavoidable postponement and a proper health th@@ read .
what can you do to make yourself felt better this morning after the We@@ ek@@ ess tr@@ all or other pi@@ pes of tomorrow and tomorrow , and get to gri@@ ef as pain@@ lessly as possible ?
Jo@@ o Water .
Al@@ coff@@ was came down and then , after a great deal of luck in the morning ... or even possibly alcohol .
as the body loses a lot of liquids when using alcohol , it has to be recovered in some way .
along with water , miner@@ als and mix@@ ture are also flou@@ ris@@ hed out of the body , and it is good for Jewish mineral waters .
since the bu@@ ck has often become irri@@ tated since it was s@@ nu@@ ck@@ led , it is particularly good for it to have a bub@@ ble @-@ free or just light @-@ touch situation .
let us walk .
surely it would not pay to go back to the grand@@ mother - it could turn out to be a fatal fal@@ se@@ hood .
but light wal@@ king helps the body to recall once again what it feels like to be alive .
S@@ lee@@ ping in T@@ el@@ sat and s@@ lee@@ ping in a po@@ tas@@ y is a more time @-@ consuming way to obtain a healthier piece of legislation .
give the body energy back gradually and cau@@ ti@@ ously .
if you are already entering a vehicle from yesterday &apos;s over@@ flight , it is certainly not worthwhile trying to charge a heavy fat bar@@ rel .
for example , a fresh volume containing the presence of fruit residues is regularly placed on the market as a body .
if health is already suffering around lunch , for example , one could try to w@@ ed@@ le .
and a little later on , it turned out .
there was no coff@@ ee .
this di@@ u@@ tra@@ um will free up your body from its last error .
as has already been said , water and volume have your friends .
contribute to pain@@ kil@@ lers .
if you get a pain@@ kil@@ ler this evening to prevent po@@ lob@@ ster , your tax will not only have to deal with alcohol but also with par@@ at@@ se@@ ph@@ anu@@ ts or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ phe@@ ts and will lose sight .
so they are paying even more , and in the future the boys will be worse off .
moreover , pain@@ kil@@ lers are not going to stay long anyway in the Senate .
if you take a pain@@ kil@@ ler this morning , then you will do it with a blan@@ k th@@ in - it will upset your already bat@@ tered swe@@ at .
or , if a partner is not taken , then it can get through itself well .
it is something like wal@@ king , but wal@@ king is not going to be a fi@@ as@@ m .
however , too active a pace and outrageous a han@@ go@@ ver were avoided - a physical effort should be moderate during the bo@@ om@@ eran@@ g season .
jo@@ ke .
the words of friends @-@ friends of the times , the easy fu@@ n and the na@@ il about himself and others ( suffering ) .
the Lady and the woman may not be driven off by the bo@@ y , but they certainly make it easier to tolerate .
for once , the po@@ h@@ me@@ ll is going through anyway !
North@@ w@@ ester@@ n professor and Ox@@ ford University workers are being sought as suspects in murder
according to the police , Professor and university at North@@ w@@ ester@@ n University are being se@@ ar@@ ched nation@@ wide , who have become suspi@@ cious of having found the bodies of men with deadly pa@@ ci@@ ons to be found in a Ch@@ ic@@ ago luxury cor@@ al .
according to the C@@ oo@@ k coun@@ ty &apos;s trials , on Monday , two 42 @-@ year @-@ old W@@ yn@@ d@@ ha@@ m La@@ them@@ i and 56 @-@ year @-@ old Andrew War@@ ren@@ i were arrested on account of their alleged involvement in T@@ ren@@ ton H. James Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ u &apos;s death .
according to the documents , the 26 @-@ year @-@ old Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ u died after repeated bet@@ ra@@ yal .
according to the warning issued to the community by Ch@@ ic@@ ago &apos;s police station , the body was discovered on 27 July .
police officers got a telephone war and found themselves on the arrival of a victim in the Grand Pla@@ za Cor@@ ter@@ ary , whose body had several tor@@ ture@@ rs .
according to the officials , the scene of Cor@@ nel@@ l @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ u was recognised as dead and the investi@@ g@@ ators thought about mar@@ ried murder , while the police actively seek two suspects .
Ms La@@ mos has been working as co @-@ professor of micro@@ bi@@ ology and immun@@ ology at North@@ w@@ ester@@ n University since 2007 .
in a statement sent as e @-@ mail , Ala@@ n K@@ . C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge , Vice @-@ President for Public Relations at university , said that Ms La@@ them has now been temporarily removed from work and has been prohibited from entering the cities of the University of North@@ w@@ ester@@ n .
&quot; this is now a criminal act being investigated by the competent authorities and the University of North@@ w@@ ester@@ n is working with researchers , &quot; said C@@ ub@@ ba@@ ge .
W@@ arre@@ n is senior assis@@ tant in Ox@@ ford University finances .
a representative of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement : &apos; we have been in touch with the British police and are ready to help the US investigation authorities in every way we can &apos; .
moreover , the statement stated that the War@@ ren@@ i colleagues were shocked and willing to extra@@ dite themselves .
An@@ th@@ ony G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , head of the Police Department in Ch@@ ic@@ ago , urges the authorities , on suspicion , to give itself to the authorities .
&quot; the police have an idea where they are , but we are increasingly busy in defining the exact location , &quot; said G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
according to G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , suspects can be sought by local , regional and national authorities .
G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m said that the police had received a telephone call from the grey camp of the Grand Pla@@ za Cor@@ ter@@ house , who had just received a ch@@ ry@@ p@@ ine hin@@ t that something had happened in the cor@@ ps No 10@@ 08 .
according to the police statement , this was a good sight .
according to G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m , it is not clear whether the event itself took place on 27 July either .
he said that the security camer@@ as confirmed the presence of La@@ them@@ i and War@@ ren@@ i in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor La@@ th@@ a@@ w and victim had a relationship , &quot; added G@@ ug@@ li@@ el@@ m .
the Grand Pla@@ za leadership sent a letter to the public : &apos; the police are currently working to find out the background to events and the victim and are exploring various mo@@ tives , including the possibility of a family dispute &apos; .
retail companies that help your company avoid becoming the next U@@ p
A@@ my Er@@ re@@ tt wanted to measure the satisfaction of workers in his e @-@ commerce start @-@ ups , but the polls were fu@@ tile .
the answers were often vague , useless or , worse still , misleading .
and even if she promised to ensure anon@@ y@@ mity , some workers did not trust this process .
&apos;@@ The system was simply not consistent and objective &apos; said Er@@ re@@ tt , who is running the CE company Mad@@ ison Re@@ ed , a company operating in San Franc@@ is@@ co , with 75 employees .
so he called on external actors to help .
start @-@ ups dealing with new types of human resources are emerging , helping businesses to find out what their workers know .
by developing and licensing software that aims to measure worker involvement , they allow companies to carry out spot surveys , target specific teams and demographic groups , provide anon@@ y@@ mity and a hot@@ line for complaints , and in some cases allow them to by@@ pass C level managers and turn directly to the Bureau .
&apos;@@ There are now tools such as Stra@@ va and F@@ it@@ res designed to monitor health , but where is F@@ it@@ bit for your business ? &apos; Jim Bar@@ net@@ t , co @-@ foun@@ der and CE@@ O , Red@@ wood City start @-@ up , G@@ lin@@ t , whose software tools are used by companies to measure worker inclusion .
according to Er@@ ret@@ t , in the three years that she has used G@@ lin@@ ti , she has received a much better overview of what she thinks and knows its workers .
in addition to the conduct studies and surveys directed at specific teams , it provides a company heat card , which gives an overview of which departments have most complaints and which leaders have the lowest support , enabling them to identify the causes .
companies have begun to realise that they must stay up to date with their culture of work , so as not to change the next U@@ bi@@ g , which has been ri@@ d@@ dled with scandals ever since the former employee published a blo@@ gging service describing a hostile environment in which those who da@@ red to speak were punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , the desire to have an overview is a profitable business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and conformity area may be worth more than USD 118@@ 7 billion by 2020 according to the website of statistics on financial transactions in L@@ et s talk floor .
against the background of the dubious reputation of U@@ ber , the start @-@ up company IAC@@ S , which operates in Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o , helps businesses prevent and detect inappropriate conduct , this year saw an interest and an increase in activity .
the Code has almost 600 customers , including Airbus , Microsoft and T@@ es@@ la .
U@@ ber recently registered himself as a customer .
like G@@ lin@@ gi , the reformed cent allows companies to send adapted impul@@ se surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and look at areas of problem with heat cards .
it also offers an anon@@ ymous text of message that enables workers to report inappropriate behaviour .
and when it comes to the executive director , complaints go directly to the Bureau .
&apos;@@ Public opinion has been for@@ given by regulatory authorities , &apos; Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the foun@@ der and executive director of the convergence cen@@ sus , said .
I quote : if a company is found to treat its workers badly or to be une@@ th@@ ical , the company may face serious consequences such as consumer boycot@@ ts , the departure of workers and court cases , even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene .
Ru@@ by COM , a restaur@@ ant with more than 25 000 employees at 500 sites , has been using the convergence cen@@ t for more than a year to ensure that workers are aware of the rules and procedures and to provide a simple way of communicating with the company headquarters .
if a worker wanted to report the problem earlier , he had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail address at the Corpor@@ ation headquarters , then he had to make a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously .
this was often a da@@ un@@ ting and un@@ comfortable process , James Vit@@ ran@@ o , the general advis@@ er , said that there was no good way of monitoring workers &apos; complaints .
however , now that the company is using the pat@@ tern cen@@ t , problems such as discrimination , harassment or unfair wage practices , which did not previously reach the leaders acting in offices in other cities or states , can be detected and dealt with more quickly .
&quot; I can get closer to the holistic 3@@ 60 degree experience of staff , &quot; said Vit@@ ran@@ o , who heads the Ru@@ by Satellite risk Management Group .
&quot; and we will protect our shareholders from legal disputes with workers . &quot;
Qu@@ in@@ lan said that companies began to take ethical behaviour , values and worker involvement much more seriously in 2002 , in other words , after the audit company Ar@@ th@@ ur Ander@@ sen failed in relation to the En@@ r@@ on scandal .
however , only when the social media became mature did businesses realise that they could not stop their black @-@ was@@ hing openly from hiding online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Control cent provide their software services by charging companies perio@@ dic@@ ally for the use of their products .
it is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors , who have supported both start @-@ ups .
the convergence fund was funded in February by companies such as S@@ ap@@ ph@@ ire Ven@@ tures and Customs Capital , thereby increasing the value of the capital collected to USD 47 million .
in November , B@@ es@@ se@@ mer invested USD 10 million in Ven@@ ture partners , increasing the company &apos;s total funding to USD 60 million .
such investment will not come as a surprise given the inter@@ connectivity between companies , culture and venture capital .
more and more studies show that modern workers expect more jobs than ever .
in competitive markets such as S@@ ili@@ c@@ on Val@@ ley , high wages and interesting projects are merely contributions on the table .
workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen people are happy in the company , they feel they are being listened to and satisfied with the work they are doing , they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company &apos; said N@@ ina Mc@@ Qu@@ e@@ en , Vice @-@ President of the Global benefit and Workers &apos; experience , L@@ in@@ ke@@ d@@ In@@ is , who is using both the fabric and the G@@ lin@@ ti .
investors will make a profit if companies in their portfolio do well ; companies will do well if employees are committed and involved .
if the third party analytical tools allow for an increase in the commitment and involvement of workers , we will not be surprised that they will receive support .
the possession of data on worker participation is important , according to experts from the working culture .
however , this data will be useless if the company &apos;s success@@ ors do nothing about it .
in fact , when a company asks for feedback from its employees , it could raise expectations that changes are to be made .
and if changes are not made quickly enough or not at all , this could cause disappointment and reduce worker involvement .
&apos;@@ I@@ f you ask for 4 000 proposals , you must be ready for 4 000 conver@@ sa@@ tions , &apos; said K@@ ot@@ ter International &apos;s President R@@ us@@ sell Ra@@ ath , who has seen companies making a mistake by relying too much on data collection .
&apos;@@ because , if things are not completed , the workers will think : &apos; did you actually listen to me ?
are you concerned ?
and if you do not care , why should I care ? &apos;
according to Er@@ ret@@ t , the Mad@@ ison Rhine , which is now carrying out six studies among employees , has been able to implement measures on the same day that the problem has been reported via G@@ lin@@ ti .
and after receiving feedback from workers frustra@@ ted by the speed of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , she managed to re@@ organise several crew in the company and to provide communication training to address the problems .
however , Ru@@ by Satellite age will collect new data on staff and it is hoped that in the long term this will result in a longer @-@ term commitment by workers in an industry known for its high turnover .
&apos;@@ I@@ f you are not committed to transparency , you will lose people , &apos; said Vit@@ ran@@ o .
&quot; and if you lose people , you lose customers .
and if you lose customers , you will lose business . &quot;
the remaining sta@@ r of the euro area is the Baltic : income growing fast
although the crisis in 2008 and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic , the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe , B@@ iz@@ berg is writing a reference to the ECB report .
according to the ECB , since 1999 , total economic output per head has exceeded expectations in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
this success is due to low debt , fast @-@ growing institutions and business @-@ friendly and free @-@ market policies .
&quot; the Baltic States , together with Slovakia , are among the few euro area countries where there has been a significant convergence between the EU average per head of unit GDP and per head of purchase . &quot;
although the aim is that total economic output per head equ@@ ates to a richer Western Europe , in 2015 , the total output of the Baltic economies per capita amounted to just 2 / 3 of the average of 15 countries that were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round .
low wages have led the Bal@@ ans to seek better wages abroad .
although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic in a positive light and the economy is growing this year , the local population is far from enthusiastic .
according to the latest Eurobarometer survey , only a quarter of Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies were doing very well or rather well .
the Czech Republic and Poland thought this about the economies of their countries a little less than half of those surve@@ yed .
N@@ CA@@ A decision to cancel the two @-@ yearly trends will change Bru@@ in@@ si &apos;s days long
it is almost 23 when a host of U@@ C@@ L@@ A players stop talking at the edge of a new exercise in a university city .
some of them have tightened their backs by reve@@ aling the efforts of their training camp during the first day .
for a large proportion of the team , these Christmas minutes provide medium @-@ day breaks .
after three hours of row , participants in the race will return to the W@@ NG@@ man football club before returning to 6.@@ 30 meetings next morning .
&quot; the next three days will be a real challenge for them , &quot; said Jim Mor@@ a , a Bru@@ in@@ si train@@ er , just before Monday became Tuesday .
N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s decision to cancel the trends twice a day in order to reduce the burden of players has , in fact , made their days longer - at least until half @-@ time with finished exa@@ min@@ ations on Friday .
for this reason , the first three training sessions of U@@ C@@ L@@ A were ti@@ med to start at 19.@@ 15 in order to fit in with the already tight schedule of players .
the transition from two leg@@ s per day means more days with a trend : the start of the Bru@@ ges training camp was raised almost a week ahead than in the previous season and , for the first time , during the Mor@@ a six W@@ es@@ tw@@ inning season , training sessions are taking place during summer courses .
they plan to run until 20 August to 18 tr@@ en@@ ches before the formal preparations for the opening game in T@@ ex@@ as A &amp; M take place in September .
according to Mrs Mor@@ a , she is in favour of a change of the N@@ CA@@ A rules , although it adds another item to the high schedu@@ les of players .
&quot; they have a huge burden three or four days and this is a serious challenge , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; and they break through this challenge ; they are struggling , they are nice young people .
I believe that when Saturday comes and we have more time , it will be really good . &quot;
once the camp has come to an end , U@@ C@@ L@@ A training will close down , which is no easy task at all given the clear view of the boarding pla@@ te close to their fields and the depar@@ ting L@@ us@@ kin@@ i centre , the high class ho@@ tels that have already esca@@ ped from the protective network of gates with football .
since this weekend , the hotel Bru@@ ges players are occupying , but Mor@@ a recognised that problems could arise during the season with free tobacco .
&apos;@@ implement security measures , &apos; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; this is a real concern and it is hardly exagg@@ erated to think people can rent a box and fil@@ ter there .
if you have a record of your training , you can do a good deal with it .
but we are using a security team there and at 8 par@@ king stations .
we will do our best to use it .
I will try not to worry very much about that .
we have a plan in place . &quot;
the tolls for Sa@@ py@@ are @-@ I@@ van@@ o@@ va &apos;s election union born of the centre @-@ centre , the electoral alli@@ ances set up by Kris@@ ti@@ ina O@@ jul@@ and from the reformed party , forced out of UNESCO , are at least as much as the political parties in local elections this year , to show our Tallinn and our departments the business community of business@@ men .
the chic@@ k@@ ens will be read in the autumn , and the key question will be whether they will all have sufficiently frustra@@ ted constituents .
who will remain with the Sahel ?
how small the support force of Ed@@ gar Sa@@ der@@ are has decreased may be expected from events organised to honour his electoral union .
one Member of the Assembly of State , some former and current central partis@@ ans and many unknown faces - is this the composition of the electoral Union ?
and why , in Tallinn , are some of the true pro@@ pon@@ ents and friends of Sa@@ dog@@ are shu@@ tting down their candida@@ cy , can they see that the &apos; Sa@@ der@@ are list &apos; of champi@@ ons , led by corruption and corruption abuses , is becoming a reality ?
under the umbrella of the Mun@@ ici@@ pality , a fil@@ med mus@@ ical cur@@ ve in Russian , attended by the older city of Lap@@ land ; and in every respect by an original computer game in which Prime Minister J@@ Ã¼@@ ri Ra@@ tas must avoid the l@@ ot@@ h and sla@@ ves on his way in wars - is this the way that the centre party is striving for the first time for the votes of 16 and 17 @-@ year @-@ old voters to be allowed in the ballot bo@@ xes ?
we look forward to seeing other parties &apos; percep@@ tions of the young electoral campaign .
if the channel 2 or T@@ V@@ 3 looks at black spots instead of enter@@ tainment since the beginning of August , two options remain : to accept that in future , only ET@@ V , ET@@ V@@ 2 , ET@@ V + , Tallinn TV and English Fran@@ ce@@ 24 channels , or to surrender dozens of TV operators each month .
there are probably also those who , in the first place , openly re@@ jo@@ ice in the free tele@@ visions , but in the end - albeit reluc@@ tantly - are paying for television and advertise@@ ments .
the de@@ af@@ ening music , the l@@ ung@@ le public and rub@@ b@@ ish left on the streets are almost all un@@ pleasant side phenomena on every major music festi@@ val .
however , if they do not want to be part of a me@@ al themselves , it is worth going home to discover the country instead of pain - and leaving the Cop@@ tic room for s@@ lee@@ ping on the margins of the festi@@ val .
Washington changes the rules of the Green Card
media publications are cited by President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp@@ i , who said that a new US immigration plan is planned which will change the rules of the Green Card .
the plan envisages a reduction in legal immigrants of 50 000 people per year , stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visas .
the new rules have been proposed by the Re@@ publi@@ can people and supported by the President .
the draft law will be discussed in the two cha@@ mbers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers &apos; money because it will change the way green cards are issued to citizens in other countries by the US .
the law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme .
the new application process gives priority to the candidates who speak English and who have the financial means to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy , &quot; said T@@ ru@@ mp in the US media ou@@ tle@@ ts .
Si@@ b@@ lin@@ to young people are moving to towns , pensioners are returning to the countryside .
Y@@ ev@@ se@@ ye@@ v A@@ na@@ tol@@ y continues to have the tradition of the famous mon@@ keys of the Ma@@ ana River gold mine .

it is a tough job : two months in a row of 12 hours &apos; work , and then only 10 days at home and again .
in the three years of the Ar@@ ch@@ ordered , A@@ na@@ tol@@ y has only seen the cul@@ mination once .
&apos;@@ There is a star@@ k order : going in , it is being thoroughly checked that the vi@@ g does not lead , and going out that gold does not take it &apos; , speaks A@@ na@@ tol@@ y .

his first investigative trip to Si@@ beria this year will take 30 years .
during that time he has been there 14 times and lived there for one year .
how much did Si@@ beria still emig@@ rate at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century in order to become a land here ?
this is an unresolved issue .
I would argue that 8 000 .
I calculated this in the words of Si@@ b@@ erian men who have themselves thought about it .
it is difficult to say precisely because up to 30 people were able to come in one group at the time , but only a man was given a passport .
the passport was awarded to only one , but it had children , nur@@ ses , etc . , returned to a woman .
look at how large this territory was here !
it was many times greater than the historic S@@ et@@ oma@@ ka .
after all , it needed to be educated , managed in some way .
S@@ et@@ os came here as farmers , but their lives changed because here they ended up in regions that were linked not only to agriculture but also to the river ( pal@@ gi@@ tation ) , to gold mines , to industry .
for example , in New @-@ Pet@@ ser@@ is , many se@@ men later went to work in the sal@@ va@@ ged town of K@@ ras@@ no@@ dorkov@@ sk @-@ 45 ( where Soviet power was built by the uranium plant - J. P@@ . - when it was formed .
did fathers represent a majority of the population at that time in this region ?
yes , they were living in tan@@ de@@ m .
furthermore , the tradition of marriage and multi @-@ nic@@ ism preserved for a long time .
seven to eight children in families were common .
how much is Si@@ b@@ erian Se@@ als culture different and different from that of mother @-@ land ?
they are different , although what was brought here was once the same .
they gave rise to a great deal of hot air .
they did so ( ideas for money ) themselves , but they always made a distinction between what was included and what had been done here .
climate change has been heavily influenced by the traditional ri@@ gi@@ d@@ ity of the pig , because here it is cold .
the changes proposed were made .
for example , S@@ et@@ oma@@ ka was salt , but here meat was simply frozen .
where are Si@@ b@@ erian villages and what lives are there ? / graph@@ ics : A@@ lar@@ i Pal@@ u@@ minutes ?
the link to the mother country was spiri@@ tually strong , which was considered very important .
it seems to me that this country is now starting to give back to it , is beginning to affect it .
those girls who have lived here in families have listened to ama@@ zing stories .
Pi@@ ho is thinking of the Estonian Se@@ als delegation , who came to H@@ ai@@ da village Se@@ to Kingdom Day at the beginning of July and lived in homes for four days - J. P .
what is still here is shocking .
&quot; it is so easy to come and get off the ground because the city has a wonderful location : at the railway be@@ er and at the crossroads of the roads , &quot; says Re@@ ig@@ o Tam@@ m from T@@ ap@@ s .

anyone who does not fear cold water can flood in the river because the river is full of sources .

I , too , have been there with my bri@@ de .

two Bulg@@ arians were arrested in Greece for illegal hi@@ jac@@ king

on the island of Si@@ th@@ onia , on 1 August morning , the police arrested a group of illegally commissioned people , including two Bulg@@ arians .
they were released on the same day , but an investigation is under way .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said to television channel b@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free ten@@ dering and are already imposing harsh penalties on anyone who is caught in a clean space that is not intended to do so .
checks will continue throughout the season .
according to the Ministry of Justice , the Court can impose fines .

clear rules for handling GM crops
the Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a coordination front on a draft law on the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment ( GMOs ) and on a draft law amending plant protection law .
the amendment to the law does away with the creation of a separate collection of data both for GM crops and for business operators , using a plant health register in the future .
furthermore , the GM farming community operator is being amended to have prior agreement with the person engaged in beekeeping .
although , at the moment , GM crops are not culti@@ vated in Estonia , we consider it necessary to have clear rules for coexistence between GM and non @-@ GM crops .
that is at least until there is a decision to declare Estonian GMO @-@ free , &quot; S@@ ig@@ mar mouth , Head of the plant Health Department at the Ministry of Rural Affairs , said .
&quot; however , we must take into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate , taking into account the costs and administrative burdens for both the private and public sectors , &quot;
the draft law repe@@ als the provisions relating to the collection of data and the training of GM crop sites and handling establishments in GMOs V@@ S , introduces requirements for handling GM crops and for starting economic activities .
specifically in relation to beekeeping , the current obligation of GM farmers to inform bee@@ keepers about the cultivation of GM crops from the start of cultivation is replaced by an obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with ap@@ ic@@ ulture before cultivation begins .
the draft law has been sent to the Minis@@ tries for coordination .
all interested parties will have the opportunity to famili@@ arise themselves with the content system and , if they so wish , to give their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs .
the proposed changes affect , in particular , those working in the field of plant production , bee@@ keepers and the farming profession .
in the European Union , including Estonia , only one GM crop - maize mon 8@@ 10 - has been authorised to be grown .
so far , however , none of the Estonian farmers has been interested in the cultivation of GM crops .
this is due to the fact that Estonia is absent from the ma@@ gic floor , the European cor@@ n media , for which mon 8@@ 10 is resistant .
likewise , this ma@@ gic line has been extended to the southern regions , and it is not suitable for our climate conditions in May .
in order to ensure this certainty , the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 on possible GM organisms for dete@@ cting possible pollution in the seeds of various su@@ ra@@ pe@@ seed , maize and soya @-@ rape culti@@ vated in Estonia .
the analysis of the sam@@ ples carried out showed that seeds were not present abroad and the study concluded that the seeds of rape , maize and soya vari@@ eties in Estonia did not contain GMOs .
the previous one , in turn , may conclude that there is no consci@@ ously cultivation of GM crops in Estonia , and it has also been confirmed that there has been no random contamination .

Con@@ cer@@ ning the White House cost taxpayers thousands
according to the military documents published at the time , the decision by the White House to fly a naval helicop@@ ter last month for an event involving American production in the south of American production cost the taxpayers as much as USD 24 000 .
the Green and White col@@ ours S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D , known as &apos; Marine One &apos; during the President &apos;s session , was the cen@@ tre@@ piece of the event promoting the American construction programmes in the White House on 17 July .
President Donald T@@ ru@@ mp , senior officials of the White House , Vice @-@ President M@@ ike P@@ ence and White House , reported on his way to industrial products from all 50 states .
a helicop@@ ter built in Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ ut was f@@ itted with a bul@@ l from reputation , a fire @-@ fighting car from W@@ is@@ con@@ ha@@ m and a fire @-@ fighting plane made from Mis@@ sis@@ ter .
according to the H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter S@@ qu@@ ad@@ r@@ on One ( H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 ) documents responsible for operating H@@ eli@@ cop@@ ter , the White House called for the presence of a helicop@@ ter with a command , the F@@ AR@@ G@@ O , a bit of 36 hours before the helicop@@ ter lan@@ ded for the &apos; extraordinary &apos; event in the south .
&quot; I wanted you to be aware of this because it is an un@@ usually high @-@ profile event , &quot; said H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 com@@ man@@ der a day before the event , in an e @-@ mail , to his arrogance , to the Deputy officer managing the na@@ vy in the aviation sector .
the message stated that the helicop@@ ter arri@@ ves in the southern hor@@ ror at around 7 a.m. on 17 July morning for a start @-@ up event of 7 : 00 and will remain there until the war broke down between 18 and 21 : 00 .
attached was the fact that , if departure from the White House were to be delayed , a return flight would need a different e@@ lep@@ h@@ ant because of the restrictions on working time .
the initial flight crew was at the helicop@@ ter during the event and the security team of the es@@ co@@ t kept the aircraft near its ground for all its time .
it was not possible to read out in the documents at the time of the magaz@@ ine whether or not another a@@ pi@@ pe was finally needed .
the H@@ at@@ ch Act bans federal workers from using government assets for political purposes .
the documents show that H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 examined whether this event could violate this provision .
&apos;@@ We asked whether it was in breach of the H@@ at@@ ch law , and we were told that it would not go wrong , &apos; we wrote a com@@ man@@ der .
&apos;@@ It seems that you have no choice , &apos; responded to the Deputy leading officer .
the White House declared the &apos; American made in &apos; event and the H@@ at@@ ch Act would not have covered it .
but even official events have political under@@ ton@@ es .
the President supported the health reform efforts under discussion at the time in the Senate and praised efforts to keep government regulations in check .
the use of a aircraft known as &quot; Marine One or Air Task Force &quot; for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon .
Presidents must use them to travel .
however , the requirement to use them as a purely photo@@ copy is unusual .
in February , the T@@ ru@@ p was brought to the attention of President boarding during his first campaign event in Flor@@ idas Mel@@ bour@@ ne , and he is sli@@ ding from Twitter &apos;s account messages complaining about the way in which the plane was used by his predecessor &apos;s President .
&quot; White Ma@@ tel is very pleased with the slogan &quot; America made , &quot; which included products from all 50 countries made up of American workers in material , &quot; said L@@ ind@@ say Wal@@ ters , the edit@@ or of the White House press officer .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 teams often carry out tests around Washington and in the hor@@ ror of the South to get used to putting the US President in a White house with a sli@@ m of c@@ enti@@ metres .
when the T@@ ru@@ mp was at the G20 Summit in early July in Germany , 58 sam@@ ples took place in the H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 White House &apos;s care .
according to the official , the &quot; American @-@ made &quot; flight mission was included as the norm for the monthly study flights .
the helicop@@ ters of the Es@@ ka@@ ad@@ r were flying for a further 11 hours on that day for &apos; non @-@ presidential support missions &apos; .
according to the White House , none of the others burden the taxpayers &apos; money for this event .
according to S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky &apos;s representative , the company was not involved in organising exhibi@@ tions at the southern hor@@ ror .
H@@ M@@ X @-@ 1 does not maintain the budgetary documents of President flights and the precise costs of the event are difficult to find out .
however , according to the Ministry of Defence &apos; h@@ our@@ ly prices for the financial year 2017 , V@@ H @-@ 3@@ D has a compensation rate of USD 24 380 per hour .
in Es@@ ka@@ ad@@ r &apos;s documents , a flight long from its main naval base , Qu@@ an@@ tic@@ o , was nominated for 30 minutes from Vir@@ g@@ in both directions .
the White House claims that the real cost of using the helicop@@ ter is well below its amount .
&quot; calculating taxpayers &apos; costs on the basis of estimated compensation rates is very misleading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters .
&quot; these estimates of reimbursement include many other irreversible costs that will be taken into account for annual appropriations . &quot;
according to the 2011 rand study , the Ministry of Defence &apos;s compensation rates do not include personnel costs , but cover fuel , maintenance and contract costs .
the former spokes@@ person of the White House , Se@@ an S@@ pic@@ er , defended the use of a helicop@@ ter at the time .
&apos;@@ The point is to show things made in America this week , &apos; S@@ pic@@ er said .
&quot; and I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and Conne@@ c@@ tic@@ ut State are very proud that they contribute to our national security and that there are probably hundreds , if not thousands , of people whose job depends on it .
and I believe that , just like most Americans , we are all proud of this helicop@@ ter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked ti@@ rele@@ ssly on .
so of course it is right to highlight this . &quot;
it is not clear whether T@@ ru@@ mp was exposed to a helicop@@ ter in the southern hor@@ ror as part of the event or not , but he was hiding behind the fire @-@ fighting car .
in the White House , T@@ ru@@ mp S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky addressed representatives by referring to media publis@@ hers about their products of jo@@ ke in their personal aircraft fleet .
&apos;@@ I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ skÃ¡ very well , &apos; he said , &apos; I have three products . &apos;

the time had to be taken down - is it necessary to continue with 7 matches at all ?
is the two @-@ day effort worth all this ?
N@@ ei@@ u thought for a long time but found peace itself .
I was able to think twice about it !
it is relatively difficult to describe this experience , but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that simply had to happen .
fortunately , there was time to cure ourselves and to think about it .
&quot; I knew I would not yet be putting my finger in the home straight , &quot; Afghanistan is talking about its self @-@ cle@@ ans@@ ing .
I was able to turn a clean page and go forward with a new momentum .
T@@ re@@ en@@ er Anne hill said that it was very difficult to look at the suffering of ca@@ rele@@ ss@@ ness , but he realised that , above all , the ath@@ le@@ te himself had to make it clear .

it was difficult to tolerate .

now there is some peace in him .
it will do so for its own pleasure .
the contest came back in May , when Å @@ ade@@ ik@@ o set up a new Estonian record number of 6@@ 280 points at the G@@ scenarios .
during a high @-@ level competition , he improved his personal peak heat requirement with almost a me@@ tre ( 13.@@ 89 ) and ran a record near @-@ time barrier .
then the multi @-@ competi@@ tor felt that it was not at all capable , but only the first hunger of competition was ext@@ ingu@@ ished .
the memory that guided him for years says that Å @@ ade@@ ik@@ o is a black student .
she is a spor@@ ts@@ man ready ; she is well trained .
if something is wrong or wrong , then he says it straight away .
it feels its own body and trus@@ ts its sen@@ sibilities .
that is what we must do .
I cannot say exactly what needs to be done and we will follow it up .
a new approach has also been found in Afghanistan .
&apos;@@ I am not the one who is doing the utmost in the tr@@ ong forecast &apos; , he says and he says that the most important thing is obtaining the right recognition , because it also ensures a good outcome .

Li@@ ves@@ tr@@ ong wri@@ tes that Dr Gordon She@@ per@@ d is such a great wine f@@ ans that he believes that wine can be better trained than any other thing in the world .
She@@ per@@ d is neuro@@ scien@@ tist at the University of Y@@ ale .
his message is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and ideas , but about the &apos; very active &apos; gra@@ pp@@ ling process .
W@@ rap@@ ping , sha@@ king wine , enjoying it and perce@@ iving it in a after@@ taste will put our brain into work in order to create taste for wine .
according to She@@ per@@ di , wines do not actually contain tas@@ tes , but taste arises from the way in which the wine stimu@@ lates the brain .
he brings the brain into the line of &apos; seeing &apos; col@@ ours .
&quot; taste is not wine , taste creates a taste for wine , &quot; says She@@ per@@ d .
the things that still affect the taste of wine are , for example , our age , the number of su@@ e and even the heart that man produces .
She@@ per@@ d , of course , feels wine is not full of ha@@ bit .
&apos;@@ Action must be more &apos; , says .
if you get too much fat , the system is over @-@ cold .
excessive drinking can do harm instead of benefiting bra@@ ins - according to a 2004 study , people who drink more than three glass with wine , loss of memory , loss of balance and reduced mental capacity risk being d@@ run@@ k .
10 % of employees in the ICT sector in Estonia pay less than colleagues

according to the UN , Afghan women &apos;s role in politics depends on
on Wednesday , the head of the United Nations Mission for Afghanistan said that the elections can only represent the people if all members of society , including women , play a part in them .
Nic@@ ho@@ las Ha@@ y@@ so@@ m , the head of the United Nations Assistance Mission , said that hundreds of women stand for election in local councils , three women stand as vice @-@ president and more than 30 % of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; emphasising the importance of women &apos;s role cannot be exagg@@ erated , &quot; he said in a statement made on Wednesday .
the elections can only truly represent the people and be credible if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process .
the local council elections and presidential elections in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April .
the Taliban , for their part , have threatened the electoral process , which coinci@@ des with a transitional period in which the role of international military operations becomes consultative .
this year &apos;s elections mark the first time that power is transferred peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next .
according to the Ha@@ ys@@ mal , the strong role of women increases the success of democracy in Afghanistan .
according to the In@@ dependent electoral Commission for Afghanistan , 1.2 million of the 3.@@ 6 million registered voters are women .
the joy of sharing makes every effort both large and small .
there is always too little time in common , but the tr@@ en@@ n is a good opportunity to combine meeting , play , clo@@ sen@@ ess and burdens .
and what a convenient solution - wherever you were in the summer , living pigs are always with you , and you will remember with your fine voice very much : &apos; let us now go down to the trend ! &apos;
without insu@@ lation , it is a good thing to have a normal game of gold or to sli@@ p down the coast .
all are the pillars of sta@@ ging feet and dar@@ k@@ ness - who would like to take the form of a s@@ le@@ ep @-@ blo@@ wn sand code during the summer ?
it is wonderful to have children instead of chic@@ ken !
firstly , it is secure and comfortable , and the rate of severity is gradually increasing at the same pace as the force of the train@@ er .
advanced villages with quite high children can also be made .
the child is reading the balance , reading the cor@@ ps and feeling the ability to be high and important .
larger children may at the same time make their own heating .
the scale of the movement lies in the problem of land and in the fo@@ ol@@ ish@@ ness of hands .
to keep the finger straight , please keep the mini @-@ ab@@ bre@@ ed properly .
the child can read the fla@@ mes and feel like a train@@ er .
the planet is a tre@@ men@@ do@@ usly but hope@@ lessly b@@ oring exercise for a child .
but it is easy to make things easier !
game @-@ plan@@ k : take a long plan@@ ade Col@@ on@@ board to clean up .
in fact , it is more difficult than usual , but much easier , to do than one &apos;s hand can in the meantime be given to a friend .
to add the burden , you can keep a plan@@ ade , a small toy , and walk around in this location .
more than anything , the little child can be plan@@ ted onto the shel@@ ves , but this exercise offers fu@@ n for all children .
while cra@@ cks are flow@@ ing in the sand , the bo@@ gus , ash and c@@ oo@@ ker meat are getting a strain like a infection .
a child wal@@ ks on to the feet in such a way that his body is distributed equally beforehand and behind .
security can keep the door on its hands .
wal@@ king the walk and wal@@ king directly .
the word can fly , rela@@ x , be a balance between training and difficulty .
the life of a small train is an ex@@ cus@@ es when it gets small things in every coming up .
the extra burden is being imposed by the bail @-@ out .
scrutiny to keep the switch in a neutral position .
children themselves have much more pleasure in carrying bo@@ vine animals and pos@@ ters .
ch@@ at and pul@@ se heating .
after the child &apos;s safety , their han@@ ging , and the hotel &apos;s back in a neutral position .
the fav@@ ou@@ rite and great fu@@ n of all children !
at the same time , the whole body trend is really effective for the elderly .
the sports tools were O@@ tt ( 10 ) , S@@ Ã¤@@ de ( 8 ) , happ@@ iness ( 4 ) .
a journey from the Philippines to the heart of mo@@ ef@@ les from the wider world , known as the Su@@ l@@ g@@ ko@@ t
B@@ oo@@ ked bags are the summer class , which in recent years has become one of its own valuable products , even though one of the right smo@@ kes@@ person has to han@@ g at his hands and to which merchan@@ ts , despite its modest origins , have been able to use an additional price label appropriate to his pla@@ te .
a red co@@ ke is probably one of the things that has existed in the age of justice and that has not aro@@ used much emo@@ tion .
it simply exists and , if it does not exist , there will be nothing at all .
now , however , the bre@@ ed@@ ers are about to make a real victory , and mo@@ ef@@ ers have swit@@ ched their mus@@ ical de@@ sig@@ ner bags to the very simple be@@ ating bags for the summer months .
however , it is not only a coast@@ house , but today it is just as popular as it is today , and more courageous women are even going to walk in the office .
however , it is worth making it clear in this regard whether such an oral summer is still sitting or whether it is worthwhile rejecting the label and lap@@ top@@ s a little more formal .
however , the wealth of hos@@ pita@@ lity has made be@@ ans a true summer love for women .
when I read foreign fashion logistics , for example , the first thing that comes to mind is that mo@@ is@@ o@@ gh@@ ur@@ ts are the first thing to do with holiday trips to the local market and buy themselves some be@@ er bags that then have a lifetime of holiday and which are accompanied by rigour , the market and also friendship on the ground .
some blo@@ gg@@ ers are so generous that they buy more w@@ ol@@ f from the market and sell them or give them to their loyal read@@ ers .
it is worth noting , however , that there is such a high demand among read@@ ers for women in the real world ( and men ! ) apparently to go to each other &apos;s shores in order to be able to become a happy owner of some homes .
in some ways , this mad@@ ness is understandable , because these are the qu@@ eu@@ es when it is possible to buy just a few tens of euros in a mo@@ dus oper@@ andi in one of the mo@@ ther@@ ings .
it is true that the cle@@ ver traders have also discovered a simple way of ear@@ ning money here , so that more sophisticated luxury br@@ ands also sell sis@@ ters for a few hundred and a few thousand euros .
obviously , so that richer customers do not have to feel as easy to die , who try out with some cheap bags .
for example , D@@ ol@@ ce &amp; Gab@@ ban@@ a can buy more than EUR 1 000 in be@@ er bags .
however , for the interpretation of Chan@@ cel@@ len@@ der &apos;s interpre@@ ter , around EUR 6 000 can go out .
in contrast to most of the mo@@ sa@@ ic buildings , however , the com@@ ra@@ des do not come from a great Cape Verde at all , but from a far @-@ off perspective .
indeed , bre@@ ed@@ ers are said to come from far from the Philippines , where they have been overwhel@@ med .
the red tape in the past is there , in particular , an export business and very often does not see the local circle .
Ad@@ mittedly , the nanotechnology origin@@ ates from the 14@@ th century and is rather rou@@ tine with the usual cor@@ pus .
however , as be@@ er bags do not need to be red as much as cor@@ al , they can combine mus@@ ters and other materials that make the home more individu@@ alised and , by extension , more ac@@ cli@@ mat@@ ised .
for example , in recent times , there are particularly tr@@ end@@ y bags with red @-@ col@@ oured pa@@ ints or sk@@ in bo@@ gs .
however , the letters of formal notice may , in particular , be sent by ac@@ tress J@@ ane Bir@@ kin@@ i , the most counterfe@@ ited be@@ er of which was not seen before .
she has adapted her be@@ er to all kinds of clothing complex@@ es , and she did not even regard it as much to go to the Cannes Film F@@ esti@@ val .
however , the popul@@ arity of the Cop@@ ts nowadays does not play a smaller role either , nor does it mean that caring for them is a hot head and , unlike all other summer products , they do not have to be ca@@ red for by special means , but it also gets the water and the w@@ et .
as in the case of tr@@ end@@ y rob@@ b@@ ers , after classi@@ cal appearance , br@@ ands have come up with all possible interpretations .
for example , if you want to , you can buy a red box from your be@@ er or a tiny piece of rub@@ b@@ ish .
it is worth remembering , however , that a classic be@@ er will never go from fashion to be@@ er .
but , what is the classi@@ cal be@@ er ?
for centuries , such a red copy of be@@ ver@@ ages , which rese@@ mb@@ les a flat from its style , has been classified as being open and short , as well as from be@@ er , pit@@ falls .

G@@ M@@ B concerns about investments in Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s G@@ las@@ go@@ w plant
the company is waiting for confirmation by the managers of the mature producer Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e plant of long @-@ term production plans at the G@@ las@@ go@@ w plant .
according to G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ land , the company has kept quiet about the future of the investment at customs level .
more than 500 people work in the H@@ ob@@ no@@ b@@ si and rich know @-@ how and other products .
Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s owner Pla@@ dis said they had invested more than GBP 5 million in the object in the last couple of years .
there were more employees and trade union chair@@ men &apos; are the first to hear &apos; when something changes in plant activity .
in a letter sent to the site of the company , G@@ M@@ B Scotland called for &apos; to alla@@ y concerns about the lack of funding for modernising production lines &apos; .
G@@ M@@ B senior organis@@ er D@@ re@@ w Du@@ ff@@ y said , &apos; The fact that we are not getting clarity from the head of the object about the business needs of Customs and the future investment plan makes our Members deeply concerned .
several generations of families have worked here , and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and people around G@@ las@@ go@@ w , as a vital pillar for decent employment in a region with high unemployment and social exclusion .
so in terms of jobs , wages and well @-@ being in the east of G@@ las@@ go@@ w , Bre@@ x@@ t , the rise in living costs and the chronic decline in production require a thri@@ ving manufacturing company in Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e . &quot;
the Pla@@ dis@@ e representative said : &apos; only yesterday , G@@ M@@ B Scot@@ r received a letter from Iceland and the company replies directly because we value active communication with workers and trade union representatives .
two months ago , there was a regular meeting between workers and representatives of the G@@ M@@ B in the Customs Area , where several problems were discussed openly .
we discussed at the time with workers that , like all the other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we are looking at our actions from the current point of view - and this applies to all our businesses and all our sites - in order to ensure our competitiveness .
he added , &apos; In recent years , we have invested more than GBP 5 million in the Customs Security Objective , most of which has gone to production lines and improvements .
we fully understand the legacy of Customs as an object of manufacturing , and if there are any changes to the object , workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear of it . &quot;
did the PS@@ G warn Barcelona three years ago of approaching Ney@@ ra ?
la li may regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not give up in efforts to attract Ney@@ mar into his ranks by making an offer of GBP 18@@ 9 million to buy him , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of this record con@@ quest ?
this pa@@ tern@@ alistic approach has opened the summer as a transitional window , and the L@@ ig@@ ue 1 club is ready to destroy more than double the current world record of buying , which was set up in the last season by Paul Po@@ g@@ ba returning to Manch@@ ester Uni@@ te@@ mis for GBP 89 million .
once the changeover has been completed , Ney@@ ra will result in the world &apos;s most expensive player and , at the same time , the most paid professional player in the world , which will receive more than GBP 500 000 per week after taxes from the PS@@ G .
Barcelona is known to be ang@@ ry both by its approach and by its breaking @-@ down of Ney@@ ra , although the source close to the Ca@@ tal@@ ans@@ ans@@ ans@@ i Board confirms that the club has always ca@@ red for football since its arrival in San@@ to@@ ise in 2013 .
but did the President of the PS@@ G warn the football world of this possibility three years ago ?
while Manch@@ ester City showed interest in concluding the Blair agreement in 2014 , N@@ asse@@ r Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f strongly warned all clubs that think about the best play and recruitment of some PS@@ G .
&apos;@@ I am not worried because they know that , when they concern some of our players , we will be able to welcome them and contact their players , &apos; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ f .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but when they try to conclude an agreement with some of our players , they have to face the consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have gone beyond this limit because the Spanish club earlier this summer showed interest in Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tti , the medium @-@ sized player of the PS@@ G .
the PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow an Italian departure under any circumstances and that Barcelona could suffer a set@@ back as a result of this interest by removing one of their precious assets in the form of Ney@@ ra .
Prime Minister : Ireland wants to build bridges after Bre@@ x@@ iti@@ t , not borders .
&quot; Bre@@ x@@ i is seriously at risk of losing a stone between Northern Ireland and Ireland , Britain and Ireland , &quot; warned Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r on his first visit to Northern Ireland in June .
&apos;@@ I cannot imagine who would benefit from it &apos; , he added .
cross @-@ border infrastructure projects made it possible for current people and goods to move freely , said Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r .
&apos;@@ This is our vision for the future : building bridges , not borders &apos; , he emphasised .
according to the former , he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union , and as it fails to do so , he would remain part of the European single market .
this would maintain the current free trade agreement between the Irish Republic and the UK .
another way to streamline Britain &apos;s departure would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom , explaining to the Irish Prime Minister .
noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey , Var@@ ad@@ ka@@ r said : &apos; certainly we could have one with Britain &apos; .
the alternative to this would be to return to customs posts that would declare historical divisions and political failure .
&quot; raise trade , prosperity and peace , &quot; said the Prime Minister of Ireland .
he mentioned Bre@@ x@@ iti@@ t as &apos; our generation &apos;s challenge &apos; and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of daily life in Northern Ireland .
